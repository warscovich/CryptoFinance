Bitcoin had yet another impressive week, starting Week 45 at $13,690 and ending it at $15,500. This represents a 13.2% increase, and marks BTC's first time venturing over $15k since January 2018, almost 3 years ago.
Bitcoin on-chain fundamentals rose slightly during Week 45, starting to make up for the previous week's losses.
GNI
gained 5 points to reach a score of 62 points. This increase was caused mostly by a rise in the Liquidity subindex, with Network Health also gaining some strength.
Network Health
rose by 3 points over the past week, reaching a score of 62 points. This was driven by an increase in the network growth subcategory as BTC saw more new addresses and entities.
Liquidity
gained 10 points, ending the week at a score of 59 points. Transaction liquidity performed particularly well, increasing by 11 points as the number of on-chain transactions and the total transfer volume of BTC on-chain increased.
Sentiment
lost 2 points for Week 45, ending the week at a score of 66 points. The saving behavior subcategory was the main driver behind this decline, as hodlers continued to sell more than they were buying on average.
Glassnode Compass
The compass once again sits firmly in the bullish Regime 1 for Week 45, marking an extremely strong week for BTC.
The continued price increases over the past week saw BTC exceed $15k for the first time since the early 2018 bull run, and this growth appears to be continuing, with strongly positive sentiment echoing throughout the community.
In the wake of the US election, the stock market has begun to rally - but BTC's growth has significantly outpaced this, putting more weight behind the possibility of a decoupling that we have been seeing over the past few weeks. If bitcoin's growth trajectory continues, it may be able to firmly decouple from traditional financial markets, opening it up for even further growth.
Altcoin Digest
Performance against BTC
Most of the top altcoins performed worse than BTC over Week 45, losing between 2.7% and 11.7% against the top cryptocurrency. One notable exception is ETH, which gained 1.2% against BTC for the week.
The worst performing top 10 altcoin was BNB, which lost 11.7% against bitcoin. In spite of this loss, however, it maintained its position at number 7 in terms of total market cap.
Performance against USD
Despite mostly losing value against BTC, the top altcoins all increased in USD value over the past week. The most impressive performer was ETH, gaining 14.6% and exceeding $450 for the first time since July 2018.
LINK also saw a comeback over the past week, gaining 10.1% and making its way above $12 once again. Meanwhile, BNB languished, gaining only a fraction of a percent in value.

Bitcoin experienced another week of price gains during Week 46, starting the week at $15,500 and ending it at $15,940. On Thursday, it rose above $16,000 for the first time since January 2018. Although it dipped below this point later in the week, as of today, BTC is back above $16k once again.
Bitcoin on-chain fundamentals saw a small drop over Week 46.
GNI
lost 1 point, dropping to a score of 61 points. This was caused by decreases in the Liquidity and Sentiment subindices, while Network Health increased.
Network Health
gained 5 points, ending the week at a score of 67 points. Both the network growth and network activity subcategories saw decent gains as a result of an increase in on-chain transactions and new entities joining the network.
Liquidity
lost 5 points throughout the week, giving it a score of 54. Transaction liquidity dropped slightly, but trading liquidity saw even larger losses. This decrease was caused by a decline in the number of BTC being deposited onto exchanges, as well as a drop in the supply of stablecoins relative to the supply of BTC.
Sentiment
saw a 4 point decrease, ending Week 46 at a score of 62 points. The investor sentiment subcategory was responsible for this decrease, dropping mostly as a result of a decline in STH-SOPR. In other words, short-term traders are selling BTC at a lower profit margin on average.
Glassnode Compass
As BTC continues to show bullish signs, the compass remains in Regime 1 for yet another week, signalling continued positive sentiment.
While GNI dropped by one point over the past week, bitcoin's price trend increased to a value of 16% after it rose to exceed $16,000 for the first time since the last major crypto bull market.
BTC's continued price increases have pushed it further and further from trends in the stock market, lending even more credence to narratives that suggest a potential decoupling from traditional markets.
Some are also circulating a narrative that
BTC could decouple
from the rest of the cryptocurrency market. However, this seems less likely, and is not supported by historical trends. In the past, increases in BTC have been followed by increases in ETH and other major altcoins, followed by smaller altcoins and DeFi. As such, while crypto markets may be decoupling from the stock market, BTC likely won't decouple from the rest of crypto at this stage.
Altcoin Digest
Performance against BTC
The top altcoins mostly performed poorly in comparison with bitcoin throughout Week 46, with the exception of XRP, which gained 2.8% against BTC.
In the midst of announcements about a hard fork, BCH lost 12.9% of its value in BTC terms throughout the week.
Performance against USD
Not only did most of the top altcoins lose value against BTC over the week, but they also lost USD value (once again with the exception of XRP).
While ETH only dropped by 1.5%, BCH lost a massive 10.5% of its USD value following its
fork
into two chains (BCHA and BCHN).

BTC had another impressive week, rising above $18,000 for the first time since December 2017 and coming close to reaching a new all-time high. Starting the week at $15,930, it quickly rose above $17k and then $18k, finishing off Week 47 at a price of over $18,600.
Bitcoin on-chain fundamentals experienced strong gains throughout Week 47.
GNI
rose by 6 points, reaching a score of 67 points, with all three major subindices experiencing growth.
Network Health
saw an 11 point increase throughout the week, ending at a score of 67 points. The network activity subcategory performed particularly well, growing by 13 points due to an increase in the number of active entities and the on-chain transaction rate.
Liquidity
rose by 2 points, reaching a final score of 56 points for the week. While trading liquidity decreased due to BTC being continually withdrawn from exchanges, transaction liquidity grew as the number of on-chain transactions increased.
Sentiment
ended the week at 68 points, representing a 6 point increase. The saving behavior subcategory made the largest contribution to this growth, increasing by 24 points (140%) as BTC hodlers slowed the rate at which they were selling.
Glassnode Compass
The compass shot high into the bullish quadrant over the past week, seeing impressive gains in terms of both GNI and price trend.
Its firm position in the bullish Regime 1 is bolstered by strong on-chain fundamentals, continued growth in terms of adoption, and impressive price gains over the past few weeks.
In addition, BTC has continued to significantly outperformed the stock market, growing by almost 17% over the past week in comparison with last week's 2% drop in the SPY index. This supports narratives around a potential decoupling, which - if it can be maintained - removes stock prices as an upper bound for bitcoin's growth.
Altcoin Digest
Performance against BTC
Aside from BNB, the top altcoins all performed well against BTC throughout Week 47. XRP saw the largest gains, growing by almost 50% next to bitcoin.
BNB continues to perform poorly in comparison with other altcoins, dropping down to 10th place in terms of market cap while the rest of the market thrives.
Performance against USD
In USD terms, all of the top altcoins saw gains over the past week - even including BNB, despite its losses in relation to bitcoin. XRP gained an impressive 73.9% over the week.
LTC has also made its way back into the top 10 over the past couple of months, now sitting at 6th place after languishing at number 12 just eight weeks ago.

BTC had another successful week during Week 49, recovering from the previous week's slump and briefly overtaking its previous all-time high. On Tuesday, it set a new ATH of $19,857, but immediately dropped back down into the $18,000s before slowly rising again, ending the week at $19,050.
For the Bulls
Bitcoin's
Reserve Risk
is still low, suggesting that the bull market may just be getting started. Reserve Risk is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC; when confidence is high and price is low, Reserve Risk is low, and there is an attractive risk/reward to invest.
Currently, BTC's Reserve Risk is still close to the green zone, indicating that there is high confidence in bitcoin at this price point. This metric is presently even lower than it was during the 2019 bull run, when BTC reached $13k. The fact that it is still so low - even as bitcoin fluctuates around all-time highs - indicates an attractive risk/reward ratio for investing in BTC at this price.
For the Bears
Despite the high confidence in BTC demonstrated by its Reserve Risk value, the number of
Coin Days Destroyed (CDD)
has been gradually increasing. This generally indicates that older coins are moving, meaning that longer-term holders are selling off some of their BTC and realizing profits.
This sell pressure generated by longer-term holders is currently depressing BTC's price, keeping it from breaking out above $20k. While so many long-term holders remain in a state of significant profit, sideways or downwards price movement can be expected as they realize these profits.
However, while high CDD may suggest that longer-term holders are taking profits, the global top is likely not here yet. Historically, CDD increases during bull runs, but usually peaks before the top. As such, although long-term holders may be selling at current prices (and creating downward price pressure), historical trends suggest that buy pressure will more than make up for this activity in the longer term.
A Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: While on-chain signals for BTC are long-term bullish, investors can anticipate a correction in the coming weeks.
For bullish runs driven by organic investments,
SOPR
is a useful on-chain metric to signal when a pull back has finished correcting. SOPR measures the profit made by outgoing investors as they offload their coins. Typically SOPR needs to reset to zero before a correction is complete, that‚Äôs because investors in a bull market do not like selling at a loss, they‚Äôd rather HODL thereby alleviating the sell pressure allowing the bullish to continue.
The chart above shows just how far SOPR needs to retrace until a reset is complete. I‚Äôve marked the corresponding region in the last bull cycle when Bitcoin tested all time highs. In that extremely fast rejection, SOPR took only 7 days to retrace, this one is likely to take longer given the nature of the month long run up, maybe 2-4 more weeks.

Altcoin Feature: PICKLE Tokens are being Withdrawn from Smart Contracts
The number of
PICKLE tokens being held in smart contracts
has been steadily and rapidly decreasing over the past week. The percentage of locked PICKLE has dropped from 82.6% down to 55.4% since 2 December.
This decrease is likely due to the fact that Pickle is no longer distributing token rewards to stakers since the Pickle protocol was
hacked
on 22 November. However, this number will likely increase again soon when
Yearn introduces Pickle vaults
.
Under this new model, PICKLE holders will be able to stake their tokens to earn DILL tokens, which can be used to participate in governance votes as well as boosting Yearn vault rewards. In the meantime, however, investors should be aware that the presence of more liquid PICKLE tokens in circulation may have an impact on price.

After starting Week 50 at $19,360, BTC started to gradually decline in price, reaching a weekly low of $17,640 on Friday. After this point, though, it quickly began to rebound, ending the week back above $19k at $19,180.
For the Bulls
Bitcoin's
Long-Term Holder MVRV Ratio
(LTH-MVRV) is currently providing an extremely bullish signal. MVRV is the ratio of market cap to realized cap, and gives an indication of when the traded price of BTC is above or below ""fair value""; LTH-MVRV is a variant of this metric that accounts for coins which are at least 155 days old.
When LTH-MVRV reaches the red zone (above 20), this generally indicates a global top. But as we can see in the chart below, bitcoin's LTH-MVRV is still very far from the red zone.
In fact, the last time LTH-MVRV was this low during a bull run, the price of BTC was barely over $1000, and still experienced a 1432% increase before the top. If bitcoin were to follow the same trend again, this would translate to a market top of over $270,000 for this bull market.
For the Bears
Despite overwhelmingly bullish on-chain signals, bitcoin's
entity-adjusted SOPR
may indicate some short-term bearish sentiment. SOPR shows the extent to which BTC holders are selling at a profit or loss; a value above 1 indicates that sales are on average occurring at a profit, while a value below 1 indicates sales at a loss.
Bitcoin's entity-adjusted SOPR is still comfortably above 1, but it has been declining since late November, indicating that the amount of profit being realized is decreasing, despite price staying relatively consistent during this period.
These kinds of dips in SOPR usually indicate micro-bearish sentiment, as sellers are taking less profit. However, historically, these represent more of a shake-out than a trend reversal. In fact, when SOPR declines during a bull market, this usually corresponds with sideways price movement; then, when it approaches or dips below 1, this consistently results in an upwards price correction.
As such, even though SOPR's decline may appear to imply bearish sentiment, it is actually a signal of an approaching upwards trend. Investors should keep an eye on SOPR's decline to identify a potential local bottom before the next bull run.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: Despite an imminent retrace seeming likely, the greater environment is of continued buyer demand.
While SOPR indicates profit taking is still in process,
net flows are once again leaving the exchanges
which indicates continued spot buyer demand. This buying pressure will mitigate and any large downside move.
In other words, large pullback targets like $14k even $15.5k which I‚Äôve seen floating around are very unlikely, this would take some bearish changes to the on-chain structure which simply have not developed yet.
We are in a solid bullish environment over the medium term environment (next 3 months).

Altcoin Feature: Stablecoin Lockup is Increasing - But So is their Buying Power
After dropping sharply following the end of UNI farming, the
supply of stablecoins locked in smart contracts
has begun to increase once again over the past few weeks. This new upward trend can be seen across USDC, USDT, and DAI.
As more stablecoins are locked up - usually for yield farming purposes - the supply available to be moved into non-stable coins (such as BTC and ETH) decreases, lowering the available ""buying power"" for these assets. However, this effect is countered by the continued
large increases in stablecoin supply
, which more than makes up for the increase in locked stablecoins.
Using
USDC as an example
(although this holds true for all major stablecoins), we can see that the increase in total circulating supply outstrips the growth in the supply locked in smart contracts, meaning that the freely available supply of stablecoins is still increasing despite more of them being locked up.
This illustrates that not only is there growth in the DeFi world (which incentivizes the locking up of stablecoins), but there is still even further growth in the number of liquid stablecoins. In other words, the supply of stablecoins available to buy into volatile assets such as BTC and ETH continues to increase, even as DeFi takes up more of the total supply.
This trend is highly bullish, as it signifies growth (and continued growth potential) across both traditional crypto trading and novel forms of yield generation in crypto.

Bitcoin had a stellar week of growth, smashing through its previous all-time high to find support above $23k for the first time ever.

Reserve Risk
remains extremely low despite the price passing its previous all-time high, indicating a favorable risk/reward ratio for investing.
Reserve Risk is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC; when confidence is high and price is low, Reserve Risk remains low, and there is an attractive risk/reward to invest (
learn more
).
Bitcoin's Reserve Risk currently remains close to the green zone despite significant upward price movements, suggesting that there is high confidence in BTC at this price point.
When Reserve Risk was at similarly low levels during the 2017 bull run, the price of bitcoin was still under $2000, and saw a 923% increase before the top. If BTC were to follow this same trend in the current market, it would translate to a market top of almost $220,000.
For the Bears
As we forecast in
last week's newsletter
, BTC's recent downward correction in Entity-Adjusted SOPR was indeed a signal of an approaching upwards trend. The downward trend has now reversed, suggesting that BTC's sideways movement below $20k may be well and truly behind us, with new support levels staying above $23k for the time being.
However, in bull markets, similar spikes in SOPR are usually followed by sideways or more gradual upwards price movement before the next acceleration.
As such, although on-chain indicators are still macro-bullish, this trend indicates that we may see some sideways movement for BTC before the next price spike. While this news is not bearish per se, it does suggest that there are some limitations on BTC's growth in the very short term, despite the overall environment remaining bullish.

Altcoin Feature: Litecoin Outperforms Top 10 Cryptocurrencies
Over the past week, Litecoin has experienced a meteoric rise, gaining almost 40% over 7 days and significantly outperforming the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. While it is still far from its ATH of $375, its gains over the past week suggest that it is regaining popularity after falling out of the top 10 earlier this year.
Meanwhile,
litecoin's MVRV Ratio
remains low, at just 1.6 compared with bitcoin's 2.9. This ratio of market cap to realized cap indicates that LTC is relatively undervalued in comparison with BTC, suggesting room for further growth before it becomes overvalued.
Litecoin's MVRV Ratio is also well below its 2017 high of 3.7, further suggesting that this often underestimated cryptocurrency is well poised to make a comeback.

BTC continued its rapid bull run over the past week, continuing to hit new all-time highs and rapidly climbing to exceed $28,000. After starting the week at $23,480, it rose consistently, reaching a high of $28,289. However, on Sunday, it started to decrease slightly, closing out the week at $26,390.
For the Bulls
Despite BTC's extreme price gains over the past month, its
Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)
is still relatively low, at a value of 0.67. This means it is still in the green ""belief"" zone, and hasn't yet reached the blue ""euphoria"" zone that usually represents market tops.
This relatively low NUPL value indicates that BTC has more room to grow before the top, despite being well above its previous all-time high already. For comparison, when NUPL was at its current value during the 2017 bull run, BTC was only $5622, and still increased by 248% before the top. If bitcoin follows this trend again, it would translate to a market top of $65,500.
This makes BTC's low NUPL value a bullish signal, as it demonstrates that bitcoin has plenty of room for growth before a market top is reached.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: $200k+ is possible in 2021
We are now past the all-time-high juncture where my Top Cap model starts curving upwards. While this model does not predict a price, it can estimate a ceiling on price for a point in the future, it has hit every macro market top in Bitcoins history.
Assuming the price tops out in December 2021 following prior market cycles, a $100k target would be overly conservative, a target of $200k-$300k would be considered realistic.

Altcoin Feature: ETH Balance on Exchanges is Increasing
After decreasing for most of the year, the
balance of ETH on centralized exchanges
has begun to increase this month.
BTC and ETH both saw marked decreases in their exchange balance this year, as trust in centralized institutions fell and more investors withdrew their assets to hodl for the longer term. However, as of mid-December, the number of ETH on exchanges has started to increase again.
While this may be seen as bearish for ETH (as it could indicate intent to sell), there is an alternative explanation for this rise. Most of the increase in ether's exchange balance
occurred on Bitfinex
, which
launched loans for BTC and ETH
on 18 December.
As such, the increase can likely be explained by investors using
Bitfinex Borrow
to borrow ETH, an interpretation which is supported by a similar increase in the
number of BTC on Bitfinex
at the same time. This implies that investors are taking long positions rather than preparing to sell, which is a bullish signal for ETH.

Bitcoin had yet another impressive week over the New Year period, reaching new all-time highs and exceeding $30k for the first time. After starting the week at $26,270, it increased continually, reaching a high of $34,550 before dipping slightly to end the week at $32,685.
For the Bulls
As BTC's price continues to rise, widespread retail interest in bitcoin is increasing, with the
number of address holding a non-zero amount of BTC
reaching an all-time high of over 33 million.
However, while news coverage and retail interest in bitcoin are rapidly growing, the
number of daily new BTC addresses
has still not reached 2017 levels. This metric's steady and consistent growth (as opposed to the sudden peak seen in the last major bull market) suggests that BTC is experiencing strong organic growth in adoption, but not the sort of viral growth typical of a bubble.
These metrics therefore paint a bullish picture of a market characterized by healthy, sustainable growth as opposed to hype.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: In the long range, exchange inventory structure points to a good year ahead.
Inventory depletion on spot exchanges
has stopped, signifying the re-accumulation phase of the macro cycle is likely complete. The chart below marks where we are in the overall macro cycle through the lens of spot inventory.
What causes inventory to increase in later stages of the bull market? Retail tends to store their coins on exchanges which attributes to a net inventory climb. This typifies the main phase of the bull market. Since we already know institutions are buying in large quantities, the flattening of spot inventory depletion is a sign that retail buyers are now entering in large volumes, attracted by recent price rises.

Altcoin Feature: ETH's Bull Run
ETH's spectacular Sunday bull run saw it gain over 37% in a single day, propelling it to the $1000 mark and representing an almost 750% price increase from the same point last year, when it sat below $140.
The last time ETH reached this price was 3 years ago, in January 2018, when it spent less than a month above $1000 before dropping back down into the triple digits. However, on-chain signals suggest that we are still in the earlier stages of a bull market, relative to the same price levels in 2018.
For example, its
MVRV Ratio
(which indicates when an asset may be overvalued) is still extremely low relative to early 2018, when the price was equivalent to current levels.
When MVRV was this low leading up to the 2017 bull run, ETH was still under $25, and experienced a massive 5800% increase before reaching its all-time high. This indicates that in the current market, there is room for significant further growth before ETH becomes overvalued.

Week after week, BTC continues to make impressive gains, reaching yet another all-time high this past week as it shot over $40k for the first time ever. After starting the week at $32,780, it climbed consistently until it reached a high of over $41,900 on Friday, before dropping slightly to end the week at $40,730.
Early on Monday morning (European time), BTC and the rest of the market dipped suddenly, with bitcoin losing over 10% of its value in just 2 hours. It quickly bounced back, recovering most of its value as the dip was rapidly bought up by eager investors, but has since continued to decline, dropping below $32k.

As BTC continues to rise in price, its adoption and usage are also growing, with the
number of active addresses
reaching a new all-time high for the first time since the late 2017 bull market top.
At its highest point last week, over 1.3 million Bitcoin addresses were active in a single day. This continued spike indicates an impressive level of new adoption and activity for BTC, and suggests that the number of market participants in the network may be higher than ever before.

is extremely high, and hasn't reset back to zero in over 3 months, as it periodically does on the way up. In 2017, aSOPR surged without resetting for 3 months as well ‚Äì until BTC reached the top.
While on-chain indicators remain macro bullish, this extreme spike in profit-taking suggests that some kind of correction may be imminent.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: Investor activity continues to be strongly bullish.
Bullish capital flows continue to be strong, keeping the speculative price premium above the estimated fundamental valuation in check. This rally while warming up is no more overheated than late November when the price topped $17k consolidated and continued onwards very quickly.
Meanwhile, looking into the shorter term investment flows happening on spot exchanges, investors are strongly buying this all-time-high.

Altcoin Feature: MKR's Comeback and Bull Run
After languishing behind the rest of the DeFi token market and failing to maker significant price gains for the past year, MKR (the native governance token of MakerDAO) suddenly shot up last week from below $600 to an all-time high of $1973.29, which it reached early on Sunday.
However, it has quickly fallen back down after hitting this high, losing over a third of its value in less than 24 hours.
MKR has remained mostly stagnant for the past 6 months, but it recently shot up in price (
Glassnode Studio
)
News outlets credited ""DeFi growth"" for the surge in MKR's price, but that doesn't explain why this relatively stable token has suddenly bucked its previous trend to catch up with the rest of the DeFi market. Rather, the increase in the token's price can more likely be attributed to a massive increase in demand for DAI, the stablecoin generated by the MakerDAO protocol.
The MKR price spiked at the same time as demand for DAI rapidly increased (
Glassnode Studio
)
With demand for stablecoins increasing, and the interest rate for borrowing DAI now sitting above zero, yield seekers have more of an incentive to hold MKR, as it can generate revenue in the form of interest repayments. Whether or not it continues to hold this price remains to be seen, but it is clear that the MKR token was well overdue to regain some of its lost ground against the rest of the DeFi market.

Bitcoin Market Health
Bitcoin had a slow week for the first time in over a month, losing almost 7% of its value. After starting the week at $38,360, it rapidly declined on Monday morning, reaching a low of just over $30,500. In the middle of the week, it almost reached $40k before declining once again, ending the week at $35,775.
For the Bulls
The number of
BTC held in accumulation addresses
has exceeded 2.7 million - a 17% increase in a single year. Accumulation addresses are addresses (excluding miner and exchange addresses) which have only ever received BTC and have never spent them.
This increase highlights the massive supply restriction that is occurring in the BTC market, with almost 15% of the total supply held in these addresses. When combined with the general decrease in bitcoin's liquid supply and the number of lost coins, this leads to an even more limited supply, which is helping BTC maintain the highest prices it has ever seen.
For the Bears
Despite bitcoin's strong on-chain fundamentals and its impressive gains as of late, a further correction may still be in order.
BTC's entity-adjusted SOPR
is still at very high levels, and has not reset back to 1 in several months.
A reset in SOPR usually precedes price stabilization and paves the way for the next bull run. With SOPR levels this high, even if we see some upside now, further (healthy) pullbacks in the mid-term are not unlikely. With that said, overall on-chain metrics remain long-term bullish for BTC.
A Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: Traders should prepare for a worst case wick down to a price floor of approximately $29k under current capital flow models. However, with whale numbers at an all time high, we are seeing a very strong indicator that we are still early in this bull market.
Bitcoin is now in a consolidation band with strong fundamentals of whale buyers supporting the rally to current levels.
The chart below shows my most responsive model for determining the fundamental floor price of BTC. It‚Äôs based on investor capital flowing into the network. This model has backtraced successfully over the 12 years of Bitcoin‚Äôs bull markets and is proprietary to
The Bitcoin Forecast
.
The floor presently sits at $29k. While I don‚Äôt necessarily expect price will wick downwards that low, traders should prepare for this as worse case scenario. This model tells us we are trading in a regime where a pull-back would be contained within a range of 20%-33% from highs (using daily candle closes).

Altcoin Feature: Over 81% of LINK is Held by the Top 1% of Addresses
The proportion of
LINK held by the top 1%
has reached a new all-time high of over 81%, after steadily climbing for the past several years. Even as LINK smashes through previous price records, its top holders appear to be acquiring more and more of this high-performing asset.
With LINK up over 46% across the past week, demand for the asset appears to be higher than ever. Over the past several months, the token's circulating supply has increased by over 50 million units (14%) due to the protocol's
parent company selling
some of its share of tokens. But despite this increase in supply, LINK continues to increase in price while simultaneously becoming more concentrated.
The continued concentration of supply suggests that, even with the available supply increasing, LINK's top holders are still bullish on the token, and are continuing to acquire more. This is a positive sign for LINK, as it demonstrates ongoing support and bullish sentiment from the existing community.

Bitcoin had another tumultuous week, dropping below $30k for the first time since early January. After starting the week at $35,870, it begun to decline on Wednesday, reaching a low of $29,100 early on Friday morning before gradually rising and ending the week at $32,300. Overall, it lost 10% over the past week.
For the Bulls
Bitcoin's
aSOPR
(Adjusted SOPR) has reset after increasing for over several months. This means that coins moving between investors per hour (24h MA) are, on average, no longer being sold at a profit. In order for SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market.
As
mentioned
in previous newsletters, we have been looking for this reset in order to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run. The chart above suggests that the current correction is coming to an end, providing a bullish signal.
For the Bears
Bitcoin's
NUPL
(Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) is getting close to exceeding the green ""Belief"" range and moving into the blue ""Euphoria"" range. Previously, when NUPL has entered this range, this has signaled a global top (as signaled by the red circles below).
This may come across to some wary investors as representing the global top for this bull market. However, if you zoom in on this chart, it becomes clear that NUPL did not quite hit the blue range at its peak earlier this month. Its brush with the blue zone more closely resembles a similar event in mid-2017 (as shown by the green circles in the chart).
After this event in 2017, BTC still increased by over 900%, showing that a near miss of the blue zone does not rule out significant further growth for bitcoin. In addition, other on-chain indicators suggest much more room for growth for BTC.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: Investment activity is very high, buying dominates.
The quantity of coins moving between investors remains very high. While normally we see discrete impulses of coin movements, this last month just looks like a single very large buying impulse, I‚Äôve been calling this the ‚Äúmother of all impulses‚Äù.
This is bullish and should provide fuel for further upside once consolidation completes.

Altcoin Feature: ETH Hits New ATH of Over $1400
ETH has hit a
new all-time high
after testing $1400 last week and then dropping down to just over $1000. Now at $1440 and rising, it looks set to increase even further.
Meanwhile, ETH had an extremely high
number of exchange withdrawals
last week, with over one million ETH leaving exchanges as investors look to hold for the longer term.
This is a strong bullish signal, as it indicates confidence in ETH's capacity for growth in the near and longer term.

BTC had a relatively stable week, starting out at $32,300 and ending the week at $33,060. On Friday, however, it rapidly shot up to over $38,000, before dropping back down again before the end of the day and slowly declining for the remainder of the week.
For the Bulls
BTC's
Stablecoin Supply Ratio
(SSR) has been declining in 2021 as more stablecoins are minted. When SSR is low, this means that there is a large supply of stablecoins relative to BTC, which indicates more buying power ready to flow into BTC and other assets.
SSR is a ratio of the total value of all bitcoins vs. stablecoins - as such, it decreases when the price of BTC is low or when more stablecoins are entering circulation. The fact that SSR is so low even as BTC maintains high prices demonstrates just how many new stablecoins have entered the ecosystem recently.
Furthermore, many of these newly minted stablecoins are being deposited onto exchanges, meaning that they are highly liquid and ready to buy up assets such as BTC.
For the Bears
After spiking in early January 2021, the
number of active entities
on the Bitcoin network decreased significantly, returning to its previous trajectory. While this metric has since begun to increase again, it has still not returned to levels seen at the top of the market in January.
This news is not so much bearish as it is slightly-less-bullish. It shows that the spike up to over $40k was driven by (and led to) an increase in activity, which has since decreased as the price has dropped. However, this decrease looks more like a healthy correction than a shift towards a bearish trend, so investors should not be worried based on this metric.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: The market has completed a full purge of overheatedness.
Once selling commences, the selling pressure begets more sellers taking their profits while it‚Äôs still there.
Profit-taking has now completed.
We can see this in the
SOPR
chart below. When SOPR touches the 1.0 line, coins moving between investors no longer carry profit.
To push SOPR lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss. In order to allow for that, we would need to enter a bearish phase, but this is very unlikely as we are bounded by the $29k price floor.

Altcoin Feature: USDC is Seeing Massive Exchange Inflows in 2021
After growing slowly since 2018, the
number of USDC on exchanges
has begun to rapidly increase as of 2021. This trend is bringing more buying power into the crypto market, acting as a potential catalyst waiting on the sidelines, ready to flow into BTC and other cryptoassets.
The number of USDC on exchanges increased by over 112% in January alone, growing from $431 million to over $915 million. This represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets such as BTC.
This high figure should increase investors' confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.

Bitcoin Market Health
Bitcoin recovered significantly over the past week, coming more comfortably close to $40k once again. After starting the week at $33,060, it climbed consistently and reached a peak of $40,820 on Saturday before dipping slightly, ending the week at $38,760 (an increase of 17% for the week).
For the Bulls
BTC's liquid supply
is continuing to decrease as investors increasingly acquire and hodl the asset for the long term. Currently, around 78% of issued bitcoin are either lost or being hodled.
This leaves less than 4 million BTC to be shared amongst future market entrants - including large institutional investors such as PayPal, Square, S&P500 companies, ETFs and the like.
With float in the network drying up faster than ever, signs are promising for continued BTC price increases into the future.
For the Bears
Since early January,
BTC miner net position change
has remained in the negative figures, indicating that miners have been decreasing their positions and taking profits.
This may appear slightly bearish - however, it comes after a long period of miner accumulation throughout 2020 while the price of BTC was low. As such, it comes across as more of an opportunistic move to cover the previous year's operating costs while the BTC price remains high. Further, it appears to be returning to neutral, suggesting that this selling activity is coming to an end.
A Bullish Comment from Willy Woo
Woo's Take: The larger macro is bullish.
The larger time frame continues to be bullish, a break to the upside out of the $42k consolidation resistance is what I expect in the coming weeks.
While the price dip has shaken out many of the new buyers who came in under FOMO, the buyers on the other hand are sophisticated (rich) investors with strong hands.
Whales have been adding to their balances throughout this dip, and new whales continue to be birthed. This shows that new coins have been bought by strong hands.

$3.74 million in a single hour - the highest ever hourly revenue for the network. Total miner revenue for the same day was over $55 million, another all-time high for Ethereum.

Bitcoin Market Overview
This week, the Bitcoin market opened up to the significant news of Elon Musk's firm Tesla, purchasing $1.5 Billion worth of BTC as part of the companies balance sheet strategy. Immediately following the news, BTC/USD printed the largest daily candle in history, up a staggering $7,162 (+18.45% on the day). The market has lovingly named this the 'Elon Candle'.
The market held onto these gains, and has since rallied to new all time highs of $49,485 after tagging an intra-day low of $43,909 along the way. There is no doubt, 2021 continues to shape up as a very exciting year for Bitcoin.
Market Reaction to the 'Elon Candle'
The balance of BTC held in exchange wallets has now been in a remarkable downtrend for over 12 months. The all time high for exchange balances occurred on 11-Feb-2020 (3.016M BTC) after which a total of 666.8k BTC have been withdrawn. This represents a 22% draw-down in exchange held coins leaving just over 2.346M BTC on exchanges.
This week, exchange balances have remained relatively flat seeing only a slight inflow of 3,000 BTC.
Meanwhile, derivatives markets experienced significant action with open interest across futures exploding to a record high of $16.48 Billion, eclipsing the previous peak by over $3.48 Billion.
In true Elon form, a whopping $438m in short interest were liquidated between Binance and OKEx on the news.
Reaction of Natural Sellers
There are two principal natural sellers of BTC during bull markets, miners and holders of older coins who accumulated in the past and are realising profits.
After a period of increased miner distribution during the rally and subsequent consolidation throughout January, miners have actually eased off their sell pressure this week. This suggests that miners have either completed adequate sales to cover costs, or could also mean they see Tesla's vote of confidence as fair reason to keep a strong grip on their treasuries.
HODLer's of older coins however, appear to have taken advantage of the market strength to move their coins and potentially sell into the move. The Elon Candle has lifted the average age of coins spent from 30-days to 58-days, as shown in the (Average Spent Output Lifespan indicator (ASOL).
A very similar observation can be made for the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric which tracks when old coins are on the move. Both the CDD and ASOL indictaors demonstrate that older coins have been on the move since BTC/USD price was around $12k, and have been moving at an increasing pace. This behaviour slowed during the consolidation in January, and has started ramping back up this week.
This weeks feature topic, located at the end of this post, presents an overview of the ASOL metric for those interested to learn more about its interpretation, and how to use it in your analysis.
Altcoin Feature: Uniswap Token (UNI)
Another asset which has seen significant positive price performance, alongside a drawdown in exchange balances, is the Uniswap Token (UNI). After exchange balances peaked at 36.86M UNI in early January, a 10% outflow of 5.323M UNI tokens has occurred, supporting a price rally from $6.33 to over $23.26 (a 367% gain).
Over this same period of time, the number of intra-day transactions transferring UNI tokens tripled from 277tx/hr to a peak of 830tx/hr. Since the 1-Feb however there has been a marked slow-down of transactions counts for UNI tokens despite continued price appreciation.
These relatively simple metrics (exchange balance and transaction rates) demonstrate how token activity on-chain can provide insight into aggregate market sentiment and behaviour.
Weekly Feature: Interpreting the ASOL Indicator
Average Spent Outputs Lifespan (ASOL) is a useful indicator for filtering out changes in older coin spending behaviour. This provides insight into the actions of longer term and smart money hodlers.
In general, older coins (i.e. ones which have not moved in a relatively long time) are held by strong hands with high conviction in the asset. Each day, the ASOL (unit in days) metric calculates the average age of spent coins. Some examples:
An ASOL value of 5-days means that on average, the coins spent that day were relatively young and thus were likely purchased recently (short term movements, likely day to day traders).
An ASOL value of 50-days however, means there were a reasonable number of old coins spent to lift the average. Perhaps a small few ancient coins (> 3yr old) moved, or it could represent be a larger volume of coins bought 1-3yrs ago in the last bear market.
We can see in the chart below that ASOL values greater than 100-days tend to occur during strong bullish impulses as strong hands sell into strength. Conversely, relatively low ASOL values less than 50-days are typical of bear markets as interest wanes and off-chain exchange volume dominates, and early bull markets during the disbelief phase.
Remember, the older a coin is, the larger the impact it has on the ASOL indicator (and vice versa). This metric is also independent of the volume of coins transferred, it considers only the time since a coin was last spent. The Coin Days Destroyed indicator does consider age and coin volume so is a perfect counterpart to the ASOL indicator.

Bitcoin has continued it's trend of new all time highs which is almost becoming a daily occurrence in 2021. The market opened up the week with an intra-day low of $46,347 before rallying to an all time high of $58,330 on Sunday.
A fundamental factor driving continued market strength is likely news of MicroStrategy completing yet another
convertible note issuance for a total of $1.05 Billion
. These funds are to be used for the explicit purpose of acquiring additional BTC for the company balance sheet. Without question, corporate balance sheet acquisition of BTC has been the trend for 2020-21 and MicroStrategy is at the tip of the spear.
Larger Wallets Shuffling Supply
As price continues to appreciate, there are some signs of shifts occurring in the larger wallets (100+ BTC) that may provide some insight into underlying market dynamics. It is key to understand the holistic picture before making an assumption as to whether these coins are buying, selling or holding and on-chain data is well placed to provide this insight.
Wallets with 1k to 10k BTC holdings in particular have been in a strong uptrend since March 2020, having increased by 14.18% between 12-Mar-20 and 5-Feb-21. This has been referred to as 'Bitcoin whale spawning season' as these addresses represent holdings of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars (considering price rallying from $3.8k to $58k in that time).
However over the last two weeks, this wallet class appears to be 'reducing holdings'. Is this new sell pressure? Are institutions getting spooked or taking profits? A few interesting occurrences on-chain are presented in the points, table and charts below to help answer this question.
Octopus to Fish (10 to 100 BTC, red)
have been in a persistent down-trend since November 2020 declining by around -128k BTC. This trend is largely uninterrupted.
Dolphin to Shark (100 to 1k BTC, purple)
have been gradually accumulating through 2020, with a notable decline of around -95k BTC in January 2021. In February however, these wallets have seen a growth of +117k BTC to new local highs.
Whale to Humpback (1k to 10k BTC, green)
have similarly been in accumulation throughout 2020. However, 2021 has been almost perfect inverse to the Dolphin/Shark class. Whales saw a supply increase in January of around +80k BTC and a subsequent decrease in supply of -140k BTC in February.
Important to note is how the supply changes for the Dolphin/Shark class (purple) and Whale/Humpback class (green) are mirrored in volume and shape. Where one class sees increasing volume, the other sees decreasing volume (and vice-versa). Large vertical changes in charts like this are often characteristic of a few large entities (e.g. exchanges, whales or miners) making internal transactions.
This wallet behaviour suggests a sizeable portion of these coins may not be sold, but instead being restructured in custodial wallets. There was a preference for 1k to 10k wallets in January (acquisition withdrawals perhaps) that are now transitioning into larger sets of UTXOs with smaller denominations between 100 and 1k. Perhaps coins are being placed into multi-signature schemes or custodians are undertaking internal shuffling to meet client requirements.
We can add additional weight to this thesis by observing the balance held by accumulation addresses that remains in a consistent up-trend. Accumulation wallets are those displaying long term HODLer heuristics with at least two incoming transfers and no spends (the metric ignores exchanges, miners and ancient coins > 7yrs).
In fact, once could hazard a guess that this behaviour is indicative of very long term custodial holdings and coins are entering deep cold storage. So whilst coins are on the move and larger balances are being reclassified, it does not necessarily suggest an end to whale spawning season (and may in fact suggest the opposite!).
Ethereum Feature: Mining Revenues
It is no secret that Ethereum fees have been on the rise. Ultimately, this can be considered a vote of confidence that users are willing to pay a premium for inclusion in a block. Users will pay a high fee so long as the value of the transaction is outcome is profitable relative to the fee paid.
Impressively, Ethereum transaction fees have managed to sustain over 50% share of the total block reward on two major occasions, during 'DeFi summer' between August and October 2020, and throughout most of 2021.
A 50% fee revenue means that transaction fees are currently equal to the available block subsidy making mining on Ethereum significantly more profitable. Current mining revenues are fluctuating around 25k to 30k ETH per day (purple) which creates an incentive for miners to bring more hash-power (orange) onto the network to create a secure barrier of energy and hardware. On the 19-Feb, Ethereum hash-rate hit a new all time high of 431.7 TH/s, almost 60% higher than the previous market cycle peak of 292.1TH/s in July 2018.
Whilst high fees and congestion can be challenging for Ethereum users, it does signify greatly enhanced protocol security and product market fit. This demonstrates a demand case for decentralised finance applications which are driving much of the demand for block-space. The challenge of congestion and fee pressure will also act as motivation to expand focus and efforts of scalability technology to improve user experience.
Weekly Feature: Grayscale Dashboards
Glassnode has recently implemented metrics to track Grayscale inflows and balances for both
Bitcoin
and
Ethereum
. This institutional supply sink continues to absorb coins from the market and over the past week, Grayscale products have taken in a total supply of 1,640 BTC (~$95M) and 27,480 ETH (~$53M).
The GBTC product has continued to trade at a premium between +8.5% and +12.2% this week suggesting continued institutional interest. Where a premium is present for Grayscale products, an arbitrage trade opportunity exists for in-kind transfers of BTC into the trust creating a persistent supply sink. A similar premium is present for the GETH product this week trading between +5.1% and +11.2% compared to net asset value.

Bitcoin Market Overview
This week, the Bitcoin market has commenced it's second notable correction since breaking the $20k all-time-high. The week opened with a price high of $57,539 and before trending into an inta-day low of $43,343, representing a 25% correction.
Prices across many markets have become volatile this week, driven largely by a rapid increase in the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Given Bitcoin's increasing adoption as an institutional grade macro asset, it is unsurprising that rapid changes in the time cost of money will influence Bitcoin pricing. Wider market narratives continue to evolve around expectations of inflation vs deflation and central bank policy responses. Bitcoin is likely to continue playing a key role in these discussions amongst institutions and investors.
Correction Resets Market Dynamics
Significant market corrections are positive events in that they flush out speculation, leverage, weak hands and test holder conviction. As the market seeks to set new price floor, we have seen numerous market indicators reset including futures open interest, futures funding rates and the Grayscale GBTC product.
Futures open interest dropped almost $4 Billion from the peak of $18.4 Billion this week, a reduction of 21.7%.
Perpetual futures funding rates have also reset close to zero. Previous combinations of decreasing open interest and a reset of funding rates have indicated a flush in speculative trading has occurred. This increases likelihood of spot market dynamics taking the wheel again. It is important to note however that open interest remains elevated, hovering around $2.50 Billion above the previous peak. There is still notable leverage within the market.
The Grayscale 'premium' has, for the first time, become a Grayscale 'discount', hitting a low of -3.77%. Whilst this price correction is a key driving force, the market is also starting to see the introduction of competitor ETF style products such as Canada's Purpose ETF (
Glassnode dashboard available here
).
As more institutional BTC products come to market, it is likely that Grayscale's product (and others) will not command as heavy of a premium in the future, as more options are made available for institutions to invest as close arbitrage gaps.
On-chain Metrics Cooling Off
Alongside market dynamics, many on-chain metrics we track have reset or are in the process of cooling off during this correction.
The Adjusted Spent Outputs Profit Ratio (aSOPR) has reset below 1.0 for the first time this bull market, hitting a value of 0.988. The aSOPR metric looks at all coins spent that day and calculates the degree of profit or loss they were in compared to when they were last moved.
When the aSOPR is less than 1.0, it means on aggregate, coins moved that day were at a loss. Low aSOPR values, especially when reset below 1.0, also mean fewer old and profitable coins were spent. This suggests confidence and HODLing strength remains for long term holders.
There is anecdotal and data driven evidence that the market has seen an influx of new retail investors. One example is the increased attention for exchange website logins and sign-ups discussed in our
Uncharted Newsletter
. As such, this relatively steep aSOPR reset may be our first on-chain indicator of 'panic selling' by new entrants. The previous dip from $42k never quite reset to 1.0 due to strong buy support (with a touch of Elon candle).
Is this time different?
As a demonstration of how powerful this bull market has been, the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric has not reset to it's typical bull market support value of 0.5 so far. Previous cycles have seen 'choppy' sideways action for NUPL as we move into the second half of the bull. NUPL value of 0.5 tends to act as a key buy the dip level where the market is in an aggregate profit of 50% of the market cap.
Whilst both corrections this cycle have created the signature sideways and choppy behaviour, it seems buyers are stepping in sooner and fewer HODLers are letting go of their coins this cycle.
Willy Woo demonstrates where potential on-chain price floors may exist using the
Realized Price Distribution
. This metric calculates the volume of coins transacted on-chain at various price levels. The aim is to find price levels where large volume was accumulated on-chain and thus more likely to be defended. Using this metric, Willy identifies the $45k zone as a potential support level.
UTXO Realized Price Distribution. This is the on-chain, more precise version of volume profile. The peaks represent the price where most coins changed hands.
$45k upwards is very strong support.
Any dip (if you're are lucky) into $39k is a no-brainer BTFD.

As final evidence that perhaps 'this time is different', the sustained trend and volume of coins being withdrawn into illiquid status continues. The most important observation is the date at which this trend commenced: 12 March 2020.
The trend of coins being withdrawn and locked away into long term holding patterns provides strong evidence that Bitcoin is now viewed as an important macro asset. Whilst on-chain metrics are resetting, and one can argue there is room to go in this correction, there still appears to be significant demand from long-term investors. This is quite unique in both trend and scale compared to Bitcoin's history, especially at this stage in a bull market.
Of course, the risk remains that 'this time is not different' and perhaps NUPL does in fact reset to 0.5. In this instance, with the Realised Price trading at $14,511, this means a 50% profit level would correspond to a price floor of 2.0*14,511 = $29,022. Quite the drop!
Weekly Feature: Liquidity on Uniswap
Last week we covered the prevailing fee environment on Ethereum
, noting that it is both a vote of confidence for the chain, as well as a constraint for users of the protocol. Over the past week, Ethereum network fees have been somewhat lower than in recent months and we have seen a slight tremor in transaction volume and liquidity interacting with Uniswap. Perhaps users taking advantage of lower fees to reshuffle their assets.
This week $1.04 Billion in liquidity was withdrawn from Uniswap which appears to be spread across an variety of assets. Uniswap
transaction counts
fell significantly from ~186k to 85k tx/day on 18-Feb, approximately signalling the local top in ETH/USD price. Uniswap
transaction volume
then surged to $1.76 Billion on 23-Feb before dropping 45% to $0.97 Billion by weeks end.
A Glassnode Uniswap dashboard is available here.
Liquidity withdrawals from Uniswap can be seen across four major DeFi assets as examples: YFI, UNI, SUSHI and AAVE all saw liquidity reserves fall by around 20% to 30% this week.
It must be noted that most Uniswap liquidity and volume values are coming off near all-time-highs so it remains to be seen if these are simply a response to the price correction, or the start of a trend or asset rotation.

Impressively, this Bitcoin consolidation has held the $45k on-chain support level
Willy Woo
identified in last
weeks newsletter
, despite weakness in both equities and precious metals markets.
Strength in the US 10-year treasury yield has continued to put markets on edge with yields rallying +10.7%, closing the week at a 52-week high of 1.566%. The equities market showed weakness in response with the S&P500 and NASDAQ100 indices trading down 5% and 8% intra-day, respectively, and gold falling to a 38-week low of $1,730.
Putting Bitcoin side by side with these macro assets, it is remarkable how resilient price action has been given the significance of such a rapid revaluation of treasury yields.
On-chain Support
Last week Willy Woo noted that a significant volume of BTC was transacted on-chain around $45k, forming an on-chain support level. As we closed out the week, @n3ocortex highlights that this support level has actually strengthened to rest above $46.6k, with 1.2 million BTC (6.5% of circulating supply) transacting in this zone.
When a large volume of coins move on-chain and an on-chain support level holds, it suggests that there is significant accumulation interest and buyers see it as a 'value' entry point. Keep in mind that despite on-chain support gaining strength since last week, should price fall below, it would become a level where overhead supply may form equally strong resistance.
This support is holding nicely.
And it got stronger! We now have a wall of 1.2M
$BTC
that moved on-chain between $46.6k and $48.6k.
That's 6.5% (!) of the circulating supply.
I'd be surprised if we go below anytime soon.
I was long at <$50k, and am long now anyways.

March 7, 2021
In fact, if we look at the
UTXO Realized Price Distribution
, the on-chain support level at $47,173 is the largest since prices were $11k. Furthermore, the block of on-chain activity shown in green below, is not just a specific floor price, but instead a large support zone. We can see sustained and significant volume has transacted between $45.5k and $48.9k. This range now represents one of the largest on-chain BTC accumulation levels in history, certainly the largest since the last cycle's $20k ATH was breached.
URPD Live Chart
An important question we must ask is whether this volume on-chain is associated with accumulation, or is it instead a rush for the exits by sellers. As a first step, we can observe that the
BTC Balance on Exchanges
continues its uninterrupted march downwards with another 35,200 BTC withdrawn this week.
Exchange Balances Live Chart
Miner Positions
Miners are extremely bullish Bitcoin network participant, having made huge CAPEX and OPEX investments in ASIC hardware and facilities. That said, they remain compulsory sellers of BTC to cover ongoing capital and operational costs.
If we investigate the
Balance of Known Miners
(filtered for miners that Glassnode has clusters for), we can see that up until early January 2021, miners were in accumulation mode. Miner distribution has occurred through 2021 however not to the same magnitude or rate as the preceding accumulation phase.
Keep note that the miners shown below are only those we have identified and clustered (shown to provide a nice visualisation of this trend). There is another large pool of unknown miners ('other') that represent a significant portion of the mining market whom we will include in our investigation of the next chart.
Miner Balances Live Chart
The
Miner Position Change metric
factors in all balances for all newly minted coins and thus provides us with a big picture view on the full mining landscape. What we observe is a peak in distribution behaviour throughout January (17k to 24k BTC/day) which can be largely assigned to a few larger unknown miners (and even a few early miners from 2010!).
Throughout February however, we can see the rate of miner sales is declining, where today, it is almost net neutral. Despite newly minted coins representing only a fraction of daily trade volume (i.e. miner selling is small net force these days), it appears that even miners are returning to neutral or accumulation mode.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
Long-term Holder Positions
Long-term holders (LTH) are classified as those who hold coins older than 155-days, and/or withdraw coins into wallets displaying characteristics of cold storage or long-term hodler heuristics.
In on-chain analysis, we must make assumptions around the behaviour and incentives of various network entities. With respect to LTHs, we generally make an assumption that they have good knowledge around Bitcoin and a high conviction. As such, their coins are often accumulated in bear markets, remain dormant for long periods of time and come back to life during bullish trends as they sell into strength.
The
supply adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (CDD)
metric excels at tracking this LTH behaviour. The longer a coin is dormant, the more 'coin-days' it accumulates. As more old coins are spent, more coin-days are destroyed and the CDD metric will trend higher.
Supply Adjusted CDD Live Chart
The chart above shows that LTHs did indeed commence spending their coins in the period from October 2020 through to 8 January 2021 (CDD trending higher). However, since 8 January, LTHs have slowed this distribution behaviour. Both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages of CDD have returned to levels that are elevated, but not uncommon for early bull markets and even bear markets. This metric indicates that similar to miners, LTHs are taking profits, but are certainly not rushing for the exits.
To add further weight to this argument, we can look at the
net balance of these LTHs
. We see a near identical pattern to the miners where peak distribution occurred from late 2020 through to early Jan 2021 before dramatically slowing down. On net, LTHs are still distributing at a rate of around 44.5k BTC per day, however this represents less than ~5% of daily trading volume in futures markets and the trend is towards a reduction in spending.
Hodler Net Position Change Live Chart
Short-Term Holder Positions
Finally, we will investigate the behaviour of short-term holders (STH) who are classified as those owning relatively young coins (< 155-days old). STHs typically make up the majority of day-to-day traffic on-chain. In on-chain analysis, we often assume STHs are transient users, speculators and day-traders whom are more sensitive to price volatility.
First we
review the relative supply
held by STH wallets that are in profit (young coins last moved at cheaper prices, green) and at those now at a loss (red). During the rally to the current ATH of $58.3k, there were over 5.12 million BTC held by STH that were in profit.
As this correction sold down to the $43.3k low, over 1.14 million of those BTC became underwater with an additional 0.112 million BTC being purchased early within the correction (and then falling underwater).
This suggests that there has been a transfer of around 112k coins from LTH to STH hands over the past two weeks and that 1.25 million BTC were accumulated by STH above $45k (which also lines up with @n3ocortex tweet and our URPD at the start of this post).
STH Profit and Loss Supply Live Chart
We can add weight these profit and loss dynamics by looking at the
Spend Outputs Profit Ratio for STHs
. This metric looks at how much profit was realised by all UTXOsclassed as STHs that were spend on that day. As a quick refresher for the SOPR metric:
SOPR > 1.0 means on aggregate coins moved that day were in profit.
SOPR = 1.0 means on aggregate there is no profit nor loss realised that day.
SOPR < 1.0 means on aggregate coins moved that day were at a loss.
Last week we saw that SOPR reset below 1.0 and we theorised this to be a first indicator of new retail level investors taking losses. This week we saw SOPR-STH retrace back to just above 1.0 despite sideways consolidating price action.
This second SOPR reset is healthy as it represents a retest of STH 'buy the dip' conviction. Previous instances of this SOPR retest after falling below 1.0 have generally signalled a calming of the correction downside, and in this bull cycle, have been followed by upwards price momentum.
STH SOPR Live Chart
Weekly Bitcoin Market Summary
The on-chain analysis above is a typical workflow we use to assess the sentiment and behaviour of various network participants, within a set of behaviour assumptions. To maximise the value of on-chain insights, it is important to seek confluence between multiple metrics to improve our accuracy and probabilities of being correct.
This week, we have:
Sideways consolidation above strong on-chain support (that held last week), despite non-trivial macro market turbulence and weakness in traditional markets.
On-chain support at $45k has actually strengthened by over 1.2 million BTC changing hands, and even raised the support floor into the $46.6 to $47k range.
Miners (who are uber bulls) slowed down selling behaviour after a few months of distribution. This total distribution was small relative to both daily BTC trading volume and miners accumulation through 2020.
Long-term Holders (also strong bulls) have similarly slowed their distribution after a distributive start to 2021. Many of our lifespan metrics (e.g. CDD and ASOL) have dropped of significantly (meaning fewer old coins moving) and LTH balances are selling off at a reduced pace.
Short-term Holders (assumed new investors/speculators) have taken losses last week, bought the dip, and had their dip buying conviction tested this week. More coins were transferred from LTH to STH however we did not see another SOPR print below 1.0 indicating we did not get more panic selling.
On-chain data suggests a relatively strong bull case for Bitcoin this week. The major risk that one must keep in mind is that the key on-chain support level between $45k and $47k falls, many of our observations may swap from strong support to heavy resistance.
Weekly Feature: Litecoin Position Changes
This week we will apply similar analysis to Litecoin with a specific focus on HODLers of LTC. First we assess whether old LTC coins that are being spent or HODLed by investigating the
Supply Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (CDD)
. We can see that since October 2020, a relatively clear trend has emerged with CDD trending higher suggesting older coins are coming back to life and selling into market strength.
Litecoin Supply Adjusted CDD Live Chart
The
Litecoin Hodled or Lost Coins
metric provides a view on the overall LTC supply that is deemed to be dormant, lost or in cold storage. Around October 2020, this metric peaked with just over 20M LTC fitting this classification (~30% of circulating supply). This was similar to the peaks achieved back in 2016 although at that time, 20M coins represented a larger share of circulating supply (40-45%).
Since October 2020, coincident with CDD trending higher, we have seen 1.82M LTC spent by long term hodlers as market price has rallied from around $50 to the recent local high around $227. This suggests LTHs have taken profits into market strength.
Litecoin Hodled or Lost Coins Live Chart
Finally, we map this change in hodled supply into the
Hodler Net Position Change metric
, where we can see this trend stands out against the preceding 12 months. Whist hodlers previously accumulated at a rate of around 500k LTC/day through 2020, they are currently spending at a rate of around 660k LTC/day. This suggests that whilst profits are being taken in 2021, there remains a significant volume of LTC hodled held by long term user wallets (the accumulation period in green is longer than the distribution so far in red).

Bitcoin has had a very strong week coming out of its second major bull market correction. Price opened at the weekly low of $48,918 and rallied to a new all time high of $61,683 over the weekend.
Despite strong spot market performance, the Grayscale GBTC product has traded at a consistent discount this week closing on Friday at a discount of -7.1% to NAV. This reflects not only the influence of the correction but also the steady rise in new competition in the Bitcoin ETF-like space (e.g. the
Purpose ETF
). Meanwhile,
MicroStrategy has announced
the purchase of an additional 262 BTC for $15M as part of their relentless bitcoin accumulation strategy.

Bitcoin Spending Behaviour
As bitcoin price performance continues to impress, it becomes increasingly important to assess how different market participants are reacting to elevated prices. In general, we make a distinction between Long Term Holders (LTH), those who own coins older than 155 days, and Short Term Holders (STH) owning coins younger than 155 ¬†days.
We base this off the observation that most liquid supply transacted daily consists of young coins that were last moved in the past few months. The chart below shows the age of spent outputs demonstrating that in most instances, more than 95% of spent outputs are younger than 3 months old (white space at the top are coins older that 3 months).
Conversely, once a coin passes our 155 day threshold to become a LTH held coin, it is increasingly unlikely to be spent on a statistical basis, often only coming back to life during volatility and at higher prices in bullish markets.
For more details on classification of STH and LTH, check out our research piece here.
Spent Outputs Age Bands Live Chart
We often need to make assumptions regarding the different spending behaviours of LTHs vs. STHs to accurately interpret on-chain transaction data:
LTH
we assume are reasonably knowledgeable about the Bitcoin protocol and have high conviction in the asset. They tend to accumulate cheap coins in bear markets and realise profits on expensive coins in bull markets.
STH
we assume are more likely to be newer market participants and traders moving value between exchanges. This group are thus more sensitive to price volatility and thus more likely to spend coins soon after their last transaction.
As bull markets carry on, LTHs will transfer some portion of their BTC wealth to STH whilst some STH will 'stack sats' and hodl their coins to eventually mature into LTHs.
The chart below shows the number of coins in profit held by each of these entities. Given BTC price is effectively at all time highs, this accounts for almost the entire supply (after filtering out exchange balances and other known entities).
We can see that since late November 2020 ($17.8k), LTHs have gradually sold around 1.4M BTC (blue, smooth downtrend) whilst STH have accumulated these coins and taken on the volatility (red, volatile uptrend). This is typical for bull markets.
Compared to the 2016-17 cycle, both LTHs and STHs currently hold an equivalent volume of coins as they did around mid 2017. This cycle LTHs are actually coming from a higher base (hodling more coins) than in previous cycles, a result of increased coin issuance by miners, and a lengthy accumulation period through the bear since 2018.
Profitable Supply Live Chart
This paints a picture where current STH demand remains strong and LTH are releasing coins gradually and at a slowing rate. However, it is important to keep in mind that LTHs also have a much larger supply still in hand which is both bullish for HODLed supply, but may also become overhead resistance as prices rise further or if a more sustained correction ensues.
Cycle Supply Dynamics
In terms of global supply, the HODL waves present a view on the proportion of supply that is held by UTXOs of different lifespans. As old coins are spent to realise profits, they convert from old to young, and their lifespan is reset to zero.
The HODL wave chart below presents the proportion of circulating supply that is younger than 6 months old. The height of these bands will increase as a larger proportion of old coins are spent (old --> young), and decrease as more coins are HODLed and mature (young --> old).
Following all significant blow-off top peaks (including both pumps in 2013), the amount of circulating supply younger than 6 months continued to increase, peaking at 50% or more. In the current bull market, around 35.9% of circulating supply is younger than 6 months demonstrating that a substantial portion of coins remain firmly held by LTHs in comparison.
HODL Waves Live Chart
Returning to the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB)
, this time we turn off all young coins and look only at the spending behaviour of LTH coins with lifespans older than 6 months. This chart shows us clusters where LTH increased their spending and are typically associated with bull market rallies or extreme volatility in bear markets.
If we look to the late 2017 bull market, there are three unique clusters of LTH spending:
Sell the Rally:
Price rallies beyond previous ATH and LTHs begin realising profits into market strength. SOAB demonstrates an increase in spending as price rises out of major corrections (yellow).
New Paradigm!:
The final blow-off top was actually characterised by reduced LTH spending compared to the previous two rallies, indicating a prevailing 'New Paradigm! This time it is different!' narrative (green).
This sounds somewhat familiar.
Ouch...:
Following the first bear market crash from $20k down to $6k, LTH spending hit an ATH as reality came back into perspective and profits were taken as price rallied to $10k, a 50% discount to the peak.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
For the 2020-21 bull market, the initial 'Sell the Rally' phase actually started comparatively earlier as price approached the previous $20k ATH. The second phase of similar spending behaviour occurred as price rallied to $42k before correcting to $29k in January.
In this most recent correction, dipping from $58k down to $43k and now up to a $61.3k ATH, LTH spending behaviour is actually reminiscent of the New Paradigm phase from 2017. We can see reducing sales over time and at a lower magnitude. In fact the LTH spending over this entire bull market is markedly less than the 2017 bull.
Spending behaviour of LTHs certainly has similarities to that seen in the late stage bull market of 2017. However keep in mind that historical and new fractals must be contextualised within the market dynamics of the time. For example, a development which is unique to this cycle is the explosive growth in crypto-finance, lending services and derivatives markets for hedging risk (both centralised and decentralised formats).
Alongside the major introduction of institutions to the market, it is very plausible that spending behaviour this cycle will have a unique character and fractals as holders find new ways to access liquidity and risk management tools without disposing of their coins.
Weekly Feature: Miner Revenue hits ATH
This week, Bitcoin miner incomes have hit a new USD all time high of $52.3M per day. This is despite the block subsidy halving in May 2020. Since miner costs (CAPEX and OPEX) are generally denominated in fiat currency, this is positive for the assurance of continued security for the Bitcoin protocol.
Bitcoin Miner Revenue Compared Live Chart
In the post halving #3 era, aggregate miner income has typically been ~1,000 BTC/day, comprised of the block subsidy (~900 BTC/day) and transaction fees which have consistently fluctuated between 75 to 125 BTC/day.
Total Transaction Fee Live Chart
On-chain transaction fees paid in relation to exchange activity is also an interesting metric to track the movement and priorities of the market. At present, global transaction fees related to exchanges account for around 30% of on-chain transaction fees with deposits representing around half of that at 14.65%.
Note also that most exchanges utilise transaction batching which makes for more efficient transaction costs. So whilst withdrawal transactions represent around 4.1% of the overall fee market, they are likely to account for many more individuals, especially when compared to the 14.65% of fees spent on deposits which are more likely to be one transaction = one user.

'Stacking Sats'
Since March 2018, bitcoin addresses holding 1 BTC or less have continued to accumulate their share of the BTC supply. Three years ago, 'sat stackers' held 3.97% of the supply and have since accumulated an additional 1.23%. This brings their current ownership share up to 5.20% of all mined BTC.
The persistent accumulation of small holders demonstrates a willingness to HODL through volatility with the trend unbroken from mid 2018 through the chaos of 2020. We also see a large swelling of 0.1 to 1 BTC holders immediately following the March 2020 Black Thursday sell-off.
Despite a small degree of spending in the rally up to $42k, 'sat stackers' are back at an all-time-high of holdings.
Relative Address Supply Distribution Live Chart
Whale Wallets Comparatively Flat
Interestingly, whilst we have continued to see small holder accumulation, larger wallet holdings (>100BTC) are relatively flat on net over the past three years. The chart below shows supply held by addresses with 100 BTC or more. In total, this group currently hold 62.62% of the BTC supply and have increased their total stake by 0.87% over the past 12 months.
Relative Address Supply Distribution Live Chart
These larger wallet balances have also shuffled around denominations, potentially as part of cold storage or custodian holding arrangements. Since approaching last cycle's $20k ATH in December 2020, we see approximately equal and opposite changes in larger holder balances:
Octopus to Fish (10 to 100 BTC) have decreased holdings by -56k BTC
Dolphin to Shark (100 to 1k BTC) have increased holdings by +331k BTC
Whale to Humpback (1k to 10k BTC) have decreased holdings by -307k BTC
On net across these cohorts, we have seen a slight decrease of -32k BTC representing only 0.24% of the total supply held by this cohort.
Meanwhile our 'sat stackers' have accumulated +29.8k BTC in this same time demonstrating a gradual transfer of BTC wealth.

HODLer Cyclical Behaviour
The
Reserve Risk metric
is an advanced cyclical indicator which tracks the conviction of HODLers as we move through cycles. The general principles that underpin Reserve Risk are as follows:
Every coin that is not spent accumulates coin-days which measure how long it has been dormant. This is good tool for measuring the conviction of strong hand HODLers.
As price increases, the incentive to sell and realise these profits also increases. As a result, we typically see HODLers spending their coins as Bull Markets progress.
Stronger hands will resist the temptation to sell and this collective action builds up an 'opportunity cost'. Every day HODLers actively decide NOT to sell increases the cumulative unspent 'opportunity cost' (called the HODL bank).
Reserve Risk takes the ratio between the current price (incentive to sell) and this cumulative 'opportunity cost' (HODL bank). In other words, Reserve Risk compares the incentive to sell, to the strength of HODLers who have resisted the temptation.
The chart below presents the Reserve Risk oscillator which is currently at a value of 0.008 with previous periods higher than this highlighted blue. Past cycle tops have typically occurred at values greater than 0.02.
As price increases and/or more HODLers spend their coins, Reserve Risk will increase. This represents a BTC 'wealth transfer' from long-term holders to new buyers.

Reserve Risk Live Chart
Bitcoin Wealth Transfer
We can also look at the relative proportion of supply owned by Long-term Holders (LTH, Blue), Short-term Holders (STH, Red); and classify coins as in profit (dark colour) or at a loss (light colour) depending on when they were last moved. Note that the following charts present the
proportion of circulating supply
which are in profit or loss, not the magnitude of the PnL.
Bull markets generally follow a similar 'wealth transfer' path over three distinct phases. We can use these fractals to estimate where we are in this cycle as a companion to the Reserve Risk metric.
Phase A - Max Pain:
In the depths of the bear market, the maximum cross section of BTC holders are at a loss (thickest light colour areas). LTHs start accumulating (at immediate loss) around halfway into the bear as shown by the increasing light blue areas.
At the point of capitulation only 40% to 45% of LTH coins are in profit which represents maximum pain and has put the bottom in for all cycles so far.
Long- and Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart
Phase B - Peak HODL:
As the bull market progresses, higher prices create larger temptations for HODLers to spend coins. At some stage we hit 'Peak HODL', an inflection point where the largest proportion of LTH owned coins are in profit. Generally, this corresponds with breaking the previous cycle ATH.
After Peak HODL we see profits taken at a faster rate than new HODLers coming in.
With each new cycle, we have seen more supply get locked up by LTHs. This is a reflection of both market strength, improved conviction, maturation of the asset class, available tools to access liquidity, and of course, exponential price increases and wealth generation.
2011 Peak HODL = 55% of supply.
2013 Peak HODL = 65% of supply (twice).
2021 potential Peak HODL = 75% of supply.
Long- and Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart
Phase C - Cycle Tops:
Eventually, the market reaches a euphoric top which comes as more LTHs spend their coins following the Peak HODL inflection point. This represents a BTC 'wealth transfer' event from LTHs to newer speculators, and the re-activation of dormant supply back into liquid circulation.
We can estimate the proportion of supply that is spent by LTHs during this final leg of the bull market by taking the difference between Peak HODL, and the same metric measured at the blow-off top.
This may be viewed as the amount of re-activated supply needed to 'put the top in':
2011 Top: LTHs re-activated ~12% of supply.
2013 Tops: LTHs re-activated ~10% of supply for both peaks.
2017 Top: LTHs re-activated ~17% of supply.
2021 Current: LTHs have re-activated 9% of supply so far.
Long- and Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart
Similar to the Reserve Risk metric, these studies suggest conditions are similar to the second half or later stages of a bull market. There remains a larger relative portion of supply still held by LTHs having only spent 9% since the assumed Peak HODL point.
The 2017 peak had almost double the amount of spent supply (17%) before the 'top was put in', a reflection of massive new interest and increased audience. This BTC 'wealth transfer' is yet another interesting fractal to keep an eye on as Bitcoin exposure and adoption continues to grow and the debate of super-cycles continues.
Weekly Feature: Ethereum Supply Dynamics
Accumulation by smaller holders is not limited to Bitcoiners. Since March 2020, smaller Ethereum holders with balances < 10 ETH have accumulated an additional +1.41% of circulating supply. These Gwei Gatherers currently hold 4.58% of supply with trend continuing up and to the right.
Ethereum Relative Address Supply Distribution Live Chart
We are also seeing more long dormant ETH supply being spent in the HODL Waves. This chart shows that the volume of ETH supply older than 6 months has been in steady decline since May 2020. It is possible that along-side some profit taking, some supply may have been deployed into DeFi smart contracts or even the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract (noting large drop starting late 2020)
Ethereum HODL Waves Live Chart
Meanwhile, the balance held in smart contracts officially flipped the balance on centralised exchanges in September 2020. As of today, exchange balances hold 12.94% of ETH whilst smart contracts now hold over one fifth of the supply at 21.11%. This demonstrates a clear product market fit as the trend started in 2020 'DeFi Summer' has continued to lock up ETH supply ever since.

2021,13,2021-W13,2021-03-29,2021-04-04,Bullish,57613.48,58215.94,58316.82,1.05,Agree,"Bitcoin Market Overview
Bitcoin has traded down from a high of $58,328 to an intra-day low of $50,929. Despite this, long term holders have dramatically slowed their spending, HODLed coins are beginning to mature, and continued outflows from exchanges demonstrates accumulation is not slowing down.
This week we are seeing signals of coin maturation on-chain as coins moved into cold storage earlier in this bull market have now accumulated meaningful lifespans. Many are on their way to becoming classified as long-term holder (LTH) coins. These are the first signs of a new generation of HODLer, those who were forged in the dynamic market realities brought on in 2020 and 2021.
Forging New HODLers
This week we see continued growth in coins aged between 1m and 6m. These represent coins accumulated throughout the bull that are beginning to mature. Once a coin ages (HODLed) beyond 5-6 months, it is increasingly likely to remain dormant and is reclassified as a Long term holder (LTH) coin once
lifespan exceeds 155-days
. This makes the age bracket between 3m and 6m quite important when looking for strength and growth in new HODLers.
Some price context since the Bitcoin market has moved exceptionally fast:
6 months ago
price was $10.8k
(below $20k ATH).
3 months
ago price was $26.6k (before the first major pullback).
1 month ago
price was $47.7k (Bottom of second major pullback)
(Side note: Can you believe that 6mths ago price was $10.8k!)
The
HODL Waves
chart below shows that the volume of coins with lifespan between 1m and 6m have swelled by over 9.51% of the supply, with a notable acceleration starting three months ago. Coins purchased between prices of $10.8k and $58.8k now represent 25.43% of the total supply with no sign of slowing down (HODL Waves trending up and to the right!).
This demonstrates a normalisation of buying the top and in fact, the overall shape of these combined HODL waves looks exactly like the price chart, just shifted 1 month to the right. The take home message here is that investors and traders have continued to buy in to BTC, throughout this bull market.
HODL Waves Live Chart
The next chart shows the volume of coins maturing in/out of these two age brackets. Coins aged 1m-3m (accumulated in orange zone) have grown by +830k BTC, whilst coins aged 3m to 6m (accumulated in blue zone) have grown by +394.5k BTC.
1m to 6m Active Supply Live Compare Chart
One of our most powerful metrics is the
Illiquid Supply Change
which shows the 30-day change in supply moving from a Liquid state (readily traded) into Illiquid state (HODLed coins). This can be due to both HODLers accumulating but also, importantly, coins maturing as their lifespan increases.
Green bars
are Liquid coins moving to HODLed state (accumulation).
Red bars
are HODLed coins moving to Liquid state (distribution).
This chart looks at the monthly change, so we need to compare the bar chart (rate of change) to the price range in the preceding 30-days to see where periods where HODLer strength is increasing.
We can make the following observations regarding the supply vs demand balance over the past 6 months:
Accumulation
at rates exceeding +130k BTC/month have been consistently maintained throughout this bull market.
Holders were nervous
on the rally from $12k to $18k and distributed some coins (box #4).
Significant Volume of coins matured/HODLed
(+207k BTC/m) as price broke above last cycles ATH as shown by large green bars in Box #3 (related to prices in Box #4).
Maturing and HODLing of coins continues today
with a rate of change hitting +195k BTC/m this week.
Illiquid Supply Change Live Chart
Old Hands Slow Their Spending
As if quantifiable accumulation wasn't enough, we also have old hands slowing their spending this week.
Many on-chain metrics measure we use to HODLer strength use lifespan to quantify how long a coin has been held in wallets. As coins mature and get older, it indicates they are more likely to be held by stronger hands who are not shaken out by price volatility.
Coin Days Destroyed (CDD)
is a metric that:
Trends higher
when LTHs are
distributing
(many coin days destroyed, e.g. red zone).
Trends lower
when LTHs are
HODLing
(fewer coin days destroyed, e.g. green zone).
The CDD metric indicates that over the last three months, Old Hands have slowed their spending significantly. This week in particular, CDD has returned to levels similar to the early 2020 bull market baseline signalling HODLing is the preferred behaviour for old coins.
CDD Live Chart
We can also see this behaviour in the
Binary CDD metric
which measures whether coin day destruction is greater than, or less than the long term average. Here we have applied a 7-day moving average that shows the last three months have indeed been trending below average, indicating LTHs are HODLing more and spending less.
Hint: Applying moving averages to Binary CDD helps spot trends and filter noise from the indicator. Check out our improved metric explanations in
Glassnode Academy
for details.
Binary CDD Live Chart
Finally, we take a look at
Liveliness
, a metric that looks at macro activity on-chain. It compares cumulative on-chain activity to the cumulative lifespan of the protocol. The most important observation related to Liveliness is the prevailing trend direction:
Downtrend (green):
More coin days accumulated than destroyed. This means HODLing behaviour dominates.
Steep Uptrend (red):
Significantly more coin days destroyed than accumulation. This means Old Hands are spending heavily.
Gentle Uptrend (orange):
More coin days destroyed than accumulated. This means Old Hands are spending, but are not rushing for the exits.
Sideways (blue):
Balanced accumulation and destruction suggesting HODLing is increasing, especially relative to the preceding uptrend.
Liveliness Live Chart
Since the first major dip from $42k to $29k, we have seen a notable slow down in LTH spending. This, alongside strong signals of accumulation show a supply vs. demand balance that is unlike any bull cycle we have seen before.
And just when you thought supply dynamics weren't exciting enough already...let's deep dive into exchange balances.
Weekly Feature: Exchange Balance Deep Dive
It is no secret that exchange balances have been in a consistent downtrend as more and more coins are accumulated and transferred into long term storage. Over the past 12 months alone, over 3.27% of the circulating BTC supply has migrated out of exchanges and into third part wallets.
Some of these coins will be self-custodied by
sat stackers
, whilst others will be held on behalf of institutions by professional custodians.
Exchange Balance as Proportion of Supply Live Chart
Over the past year, only two major exchanges have seen aggregate positive inflows (increased balances), Binance and Gemini. These two exchanges have attracted combined inflows of over 270k BTC, representing significant increases to their total balance. A significant portion of Gemini inflows will also correlate with Gemini's institutional custody solutions which further adds to the supply held in long term storage.
Exchange Balances (Stacked) Live Chart
Meanwhile, the remaining major exchanges have seen combined outflows of over 616k BTC over the past year. Between Coinbase and Huobi alone, the combined outflow is around 400k BTC which completely offsets the positive inflows into Gemini and Binance.
This demonstrates the magnitude of the exchange balance draw-down that has occurred since March 2020.
Exchange Balances (Stacked) Live Chart
Of particular interest is the balance of coins on Coinbase, a preferred venue for accumulation by US institutions. The chart below shows the BTC balance on Coinbase over the past year.
We can see that in December 2020, the game changed. As BTC price approached the previous cycle ATH at $20k and market confidence grew, serious institutional accumulation commenced. This started with 37.4k BTC withdrawn in December.
In the months that followed an incredible stair stepping
'whale cost averaging'
pattern emerged, as tens of thousands of coins were accumulated each month. The consistency, frequency and size of this balance change is astounding to see play out in on-chain data and really shows the aggressive accumulation by institutions this year.
Exchange Balances (Stacked) Live Chart
Watching supply and demand dynamics play out on-chain is a fascinating process. By combining coin lifespan, considering age brackets and spending behaviour alongside exchange balances, we can establish a model for the overall coin flow in across the network.
It is important to remember monitoring exchange inflows and outflows is a dynamic system with imperfect data. It is key to consider all such metrics as indicative and within a wider macro trend and context. At Glassnode, we aim to present the highest quality and most accurate data possible and use publications like this one to help contextualise our metrics.

2021,14,2021-W14,2021-04-05,2021-04-11,Bullish,59123.02,59985.26,58434.06,1.46,Agree,"Bitcoin Market Overview
The Bitcoin market has traded within a relatively narrow 5.4% range this week, between a low of $57,168 and a high of $60,265. Bitcoin has now reached the milestone of trading at a $1 Trillion market capitalisation for one whole week, a position that will hold for all prices above $53,566. This is a strong vote of confidence for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class as a whole.
On-chain activity continues to reinforce this position with a volume equivalent to over 10% of circulating supply transacting above the $1 Trillion threshold. Meanwhile, miners have returned to accumulation mode and on-chain metrics have almost reset. Interestingly, futures open interest has hit new ATHs whilst both volume and short liquidations are in decline.
$1 Trillion On-chain Support
Having now entered the 'twelve zeros club', the immediate question is whether the market can sustain these levels and what degree of price support we have below us.
The URPD metric shows on-chain transaction volume grouped into price clusters, forming an on-chain equivalent to the volume profile metric often deployed in technical analysis. Where a large volume of coins are transacted within a particular price band, it is likely to form a strong support (or resistance) level.
Above the $1 Trillion Threshold, over 1.98M BTC have been transacted, equivalent to 10.6% of the circulating supply. Impressively, this on-chain volume has formed one of the strongest on-chain support levels since prices were $11k to $12k.
Peak volume in this cluster hit 297k BTC, transacted between $58.5k and $59.1k. The average volume of this cluster is 152k BTC which is also higher than the majority of clusters transacted at lower prices. It is likely that this volume cluster will form a very strong support level and appears to be justifying Bitcoin's 'twelve zeros club' status.
URPD Live Chart
To support this observation, we review the total transaction volume denominated in USD over time. The chart below uses Glassnode's
Entity Adjustment
algorithm (EA) which is used to filter out transfers which are not considered economically meaningful (e.g. internal exchange transactions and self-transfers).
Through 2019 and into mid 2020, the Bitcoin network typically settled around $1.7B in EA volume per day. On-chain transaction volume has since risen, alongside price, by over 720%, now settling a typical $12.25B in EA value per day. This implies that despite the significant increase in coin price, there has been an an equivalent increase in transaction (and trade) volume to support and justify the bull market performance.
Entity Adjusted Total Transfer Volume Live Chart
On-chain Sentiment
Last week
we showed how long term holders have slowed the spending of old coins in the last three months, a trend that has continued into this week. Additionally, Miners have now joined in, with the Miner net position change metric flashing green, indicating miners are holding onto newly mined coins.
Whilst miners have an increasingly small influence as sell-side entities (when compared to daily trade volume), their spending patterns provide insight into the sentiment of some of the biggest bulls in the Bitcoin market.
Miner net position change Live Chart
The Adjusted SOPR indicator provides us with insight into how much profit was realised by spent coins each day (whilst ignoring coins younger than 1hr). If profits are taken by old coins, aSOPR will trend higher and, conversely, it will trend lower when profitable coins remain dormant.
The higher the aSOPR metric is, the more profit has been taken off the table.
When aSOPR falls below 1.0, it means spent coins were at an aggregate loss.
In bull markets, we typically see a 'reset' of aSOPR where it returns close to or below 1.0 during price corrections. This signals that profitable coins are staying dormant and confidence is returning to hold the asset.
The aSOPR chart below shows two key observations:
aSOPR has almost reset to 1.0 this week suggesting reduced profit taking and suggests confidence remains in the market.
Successive peaks in aSOPR have reduced over the past three months. This suggests that fewer profits are being taken as the bull market carries on, again signifying a longer term trend of confidence in the market.
Adjusted SOPR Live Chart
Finally we review the wealth distribution between long-term holders (LTH) and short-term holders (STH) which is often a cyclical indicator of wealth transfer events.
This analysis points to some key observations:
STHs have accumulated
around 440k more BTC than LTH's have spent over the past 6 months suggesting new demand coming into the market has exceeded LTH sell volume.
The relative
wealth transfer is slowing down
as shown in pink. This will occur as Long term holders slow their spending and coins accumulated in the
last 6 months begin to mature
.
A similar wealth transfer occurred near the 2017 peak
, making this an interesting metric to keep an eye on. This has potential to be both a supply constraint (bullish) but also suggests a cyclical change in holding behaviour (potential for volatility in either direction).
A key difference to 2017
is that LTHs currently hold 66% of the circulating supply which is much higher than the 58% they held at the 2017 peak. This suggests that this cycle has increased 'HODL' demand compared to historical cycles. The flip-side to this is that there are more coins in profit that may become overhead supply in the future.
LTH and STH Relative Holdings Live Chart
Overall, the past few weeks have seen remarkable strength and demand to HODL coins in a bull market. This week has largely continued that trend with positive signs from both miners and long term holders whilst transaction volumes support the new Trillion dollar valuation.
The above analysis considers the spot market and on-chain flows. Since this is the first Bitcoin bull market with widespread access to derivatives, we will also look into the futures markets to assess overall performance of derivatives markets.
Futures Cash and Carry Trade
Futures open interest has hit yet another all-time-high of over $23.1B this week, with Binance and OKex representing the lions share with a combined total of 32% of all contracts.
Futures Open Interest Live Chart
Interestingly, futures volumes have been in steady decline throughout March with this week being particularly quiet relative to volume in previous months.
Futures Traded Volume Live Chart
Perpetual futures funding rates have also nearly reset to neutral levels suggesting a reduction in excessive long speculation and/or an increase in short interest to balance out long traders.
Futures Funding Rates Live Chart
Short seller liquidations have also been in decline over the last few months despite new all time highs in open interest. This suggests that short sellers either have exceptional risk management in a bull market, or more likely, many are deploying a risk neutral strategy in a 'cash and carry' trade.
Short Liquidations Live Chart
The combination of high open interest, reducing futures volume, few short liquidations and reduced funding rates supports the case that the 'cash and carry' trade is a favoured strategy in current market conditions.
Cash and carry trades allow traders to combine long spot and short futures to lock in the prevailing funding rate/premium whilst remaining risk neutral for price volatility. As more traders take advantage of this arbitrage, open short interest will increase however without corresponding liquidations as traders are net neutral via spot holdings.
Weekly Feature: Compound Token
This week, DeFi tokens have seen renewed interest reflected in both out-performing price appreciation and also in early signs of renewed growth in on-chain activity.
Compound Protocol (COMP) in particular has seen a very strong week as the token price approaches the previous ATH set in early Feb 2021. This week, COMP has added an additional 2.3k new non-zero balance holders bringing the total to over 148k addresses, an increase of 1.5%. Over the same period the COMP token price has more than doubled from $227 to over $540.
COMP Non-zero Address Count Live Chart
Transaction volumes for COMP have also seen a steady increase over the last two weeks after a lull in on-chain activity through early March. At present, 200k to 300k COMP are transacted daily which is approaching transaction volumes similar to early Feb when COMP was hitting its all-time-high price of $564.81.
COMP Transaction Volume Live Chart
Finally, the balance held on exchanges has also risen alongside token price for the last two weeks. An additional 41.1k COMP have been deposited to exchanges this week representing an increase in exchange balance of around 20%.

This week the Bitcoin market made another attempt at an ATH, with price rallying from a low of $55,664 to a weekly high of $61,235, just $448 off the peak set in mid-March. The market also saw growing excitement around the
Coinbase direct listing
, scheduled on April 14, as well as
Grayscale's clarification
around intent to convert the GBTC Trust into an EFT.
On-chain data continues to show resilience across many metrics with HODLed coins maturing to reach long term holder status, stablecoin supplies keep expanding, and cyclical metrics remain elevated but are not overheated...yet.
Rick Astley's Coins
Willy Woo
has expanded the Bitcoin market jargon with the introduction of the
'Rick Astley'
buyer. These are strong hands who are
never gonna give you
up
[read: hodling coins forever], nor
let you
down
[read: never let their sat balance go down].
The
Liquid position change metric
Willy refers to indicates the rate at which coins are crossing the Liquid to Illiquid threshold. This metric considers coins in the last 30-days that either matured
older than 155-day
s, or have been transferred into wallets where two or more coins have gone in, but have none have been spent.
Rick Astley loving this dip. He's the guy (marked in red) that buys and never sells.
Data:

pic.twitter.com/32PQzxCF6B
‚Äî Willy Woo (@woonomic)
April 7, 2021
Another powerful metric is the Bitcoin HODLer Position Change which presents the overall change in the global Rick Astley balance. This metric will be:
Red and trend down
when more old coins are spent than are maturing across the 155-day age threshold.
Green and trend up
when more coins mature across the 155-day age threshold than old coins being spent.
155-days ago was around mid November 2020, and BTC prices were trading up from $16k to $18k. This followed Microstrategy's initial two BTC acquisitions ($250m in Aug and $175m in Sept) and was around the time Coinbase exchange balances began to deplete (see our
Week 13 Newsletter
). This suggested that real institutional demand had arrived.
As a result, it is likely that the coins purchased by institutions in late 2020 and early 2021 are starting to mature past the 155-day threshold (assuming they held on in true Rick Astley style). As such, the HODLer Position Change metric is currently trending higher and if these institutional buyers did HODL, it is likely to continue in this trajectory over the coming months (keep in mind there will be a time lag between purchase and coins ending up in their final custody/cold storage arrangement).
HODLer Position Change Live Chart
A new metric available on Glassnode Studio is
Coin Years Destroyed (CYD)
. This metric tracks the number of coin-days destroyed over the last 365 days. It provides a cyclical indicator to see if Rick Astley has been spending or HODLing over the last year.
High / Uptrend in CYD
means Rick has spent many old coins in the last year and may be letting you down.
Low / Downtrend in CYD
means Rick has been accumulating/HODLing in the last year and is never going to give you up.
Whilst CYD is trending higher, it is notable that we are currently at a CYD level similar to the 2013 top, but are well below the 2017 top. Given the Bitcoin network is older, and coins in the supply have had more time to accumulate coin-days, if many HODLers were spending their coins, we would expect a relatively large CYD reading.
This suggests Rick Astley is still not ready to turn around and hurt you [read: in general, HODLers are still not spending their old coins].

Stablecoin Supply Growth Continues
This market cycle has two significant structural changes relative to previous market cycles:
Explosive growth in the availability of
derivatives
for speculation and hedging of risk.
Proliferation of
stablecoins
as both a reference trading currency and as DeFi collateral.
Growth in the three biggest stablecoins, USDT, USDC and BUSD, has been tremendous over the past 6 months reaching a combined market value of $60.25 Billion (these three represent 92.75% of the total stablecoin market).
The chart below presents the supply growth of these top stablecoins alongside the Bitcoin market cap, demonstrating a correlated growth in demand for both assets. USDT supply alone has increased by $3.36 Billion over the past two weeks even as BTC price has traded sideways.
USDT, USDC and BUSD Supply Live Chart
As more value flows into stablecoins, it creates more native 'digital dollars' that are readily transferable throughout cryptocurrency markets. This enhances market liquidity and depth and has created opportunities for both centralised exchange and DeFi products.
The
Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR)
presents a ratio of the Bitcoin market cap to the total stablecoin supply. This metric can be used to estimate the global 'buying power' of stablecoins in the ecosystem.
If the price of Bitcoin is low
, that [stablecoin] supply is able to buy a larger portion of the circulating BTC supply and therefore, push the price up ‚Äî
buying power is high [and SSR is Low]
.
As the price of BTC goes up,
that supply of stablecoins is able to purchase less and less of the BTC on the market which reduces its ability to move the price upwards ‚Äî
buying power is low [and SSR is High]
.
The growth of stablecoin supplies throughout 2020-21 has held the SSR metric near historical lows suggesting a relatively high buying power of digitally native dollars. The demand for digital dollars appears to be keeping pace with demand for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole.

Weekly Feature: Cyclical Indicators
Bitcoin is known for its programmatic halving cycles, and despite each cycle having a unique market structure, often market tops have historically had similar characteristics. Many readers naturally be seeking out metrics that indicate when speculation gets so hot that paint is peeling off the walls.
Glassnode has also recently released our üö®
Alerts Tool
üö® which allows you to set email and/or Telegram notifications for when specific values of our indicators are reached. This next section will present a handful of cyclical metrics and some key levels to watch and pair well with custom alerts.
Important Note:
Remember, despite man-kinds greatest efforts, no metric can predict the future. Always consider metrics like the following within the context of the broader market and on-chain structure.
Reserve Risk
Reserve Risk
is an oscillator that measures the cumulative 'opportunity cost' of coin holders deciding not to spend their coins. It will trend higher when price increases or when HODLers start spending their coins (realising profits).
Market tops have historically occurred at Reserve Risk values > 0.02 but often extend well beyond that with both 2013 reaching 65% higher for example.
Heating Up:
Reserve Risk > 0.02
Boiling Over:
Reserve Risk > 0.025
Reserve Risk Live Chart
MVRV Z-Score
The standard
MVRV Ratio
takes the ratio of the Market cap to the Realised cap as an indicator of aggregate 'profit stored' within the on-chain network. The
MVRV Z-Score
then applies statistical normalisation to consider how many standard deviations the market cap is trading above or below the realised cap mean.
Market tops have historically occurred at MVRV Z-Score values > 7.0 however have consistently reached values greater than 11.0 in all previous cycles.
Heating up:
MVRV-Z > 7.0
Paint isd P:
MVRV-Z > 10.0
MVRV Z-Score Live Chart
Net Unrealised Profit and Loss (NUPL)
The
NUPL metric
takes the difference between the market cap and the realised cap and then divides by the market cap. This presents an estimate of the amount of profit or loss in the system as a multiple of the Market cap.
In other words, a NUPL value of +0.5 indicates that the total profit held by unspent coins is a value equal to 50% of the market cap.
Market tops have historically occurred at NUPL values > 0.75 suggesting aggregate unrealised profit in the system is greater 75% of the market cap.
Heating Up:
NUPL > 0.70
Overheated:
NUPL > 0.75

2021,16,2021-W16,2021-04-19,2021-04-25,Bullish,55696.83,49121.00,52585.14,-11.81,Disagree,"Bitcoin Market Overview
The Bitcoin market ran into significant volatility this week, especially in comparison to the relatively calm consolidation in play since late February. This week, BTC price hit a new all-time-high of $64,717 in the lead-up to the much anticipated Coinbase direct listing. However this was short lived and was followed by a sell-off on Sunday with BTC trading down by more than -18% to a low of $52,829.
There was no market shortage of narratives attempting to explain this volatility, ranging from mismatched expectations vs reality around the Coinbase listing, a 40%+ drop in mining hash-rate, and billions of dollars in liquidations and flushed out leverage. This week we will assess the data behind these narratives as well as explore an accelerating trend of new and likely retail dominant entrants coming into the Bitcoin market.
Hash-rate Falls Significantly
One of the primary narratives circulating around Sunday's sell-off was a spooking of the market due to a precipitous drop in mining hash-rate (although the timing of Sunday's sell off is later than changes in hash-rate and thus is unlikely the primary driver). The hash-rate decline, started late on 15 April and is understood to be due to
power outages and a coal mine accident in Xinjiang China
, a major centre for the Bitcoin mining industry.
Mean block-intervals, which protocol difficulty targets to 600 seconds, began rising late on 15th, before peaking at over 1,300 seconds (21.6 mins) two days later. Hash-power has since started to recover with average block-intervals speeding back up to an average of 1,000 seconds (16.67 mins).
Mean Block-Interval Live Chart
The impact on estimated hash-rate was a drop from 203.37 EH/s down to 114.27 EH/s at the lows, representing around 43.8% of the estimated network hash-power going offline. Hash-rate has since recovered by 33% to 151.97 EH/s.
It is important to note that hash-rate is not explicitly known and must be estimated based on the currently mining difficulty and the observed block-intervals. Given there is natural variance between blocks, especially over short time periods (< 1wk), it is common for hash-rate estimates to vary between sources and over different timescales. Thus, block-intervals generally provide a more meaningful and accurate metric for tracking day-to-day mining market mechanics and hash-rate values should be considered within this context.
Hash-rate Live Chart
Update 20-Apr: Further estimates from miners familiar with the incident in China have suggested that the net impact to global hash-rate was a fall of 20% to 25%, demonstrating the influence of natural block-interval variance on hash-rate estimations.
Due to an incident in Xinjiang, China, Bitcoin‚Äôs Hashrate dropped by an estimated 20-25% from April 15-16th. What did we learn from this? How could this effect the future of Bitcoin? Here are some thoughts:

Derivatives Flush Out Excess Leverage
As is customary in the Bitcoin market, excessive leverage is flushed out during rapid price moves, and this week was no exception. As many traders increased their leverage exposure, likely in anticipation of the Coinbase direct listing, the risk of a long squeeze and cascading liquidations had built up in the system.
Open Interest across derivatives exchanges reached a new all-time-high of $27.4 Billion as price rallied to new highs. However, by Sunday afternoon, a total of $4.9 Billion in futures contracts had been closed out, with the majority of them occurring during the Sunday sell-off.
Futures Open Interest Live Chart
Long Liquidations across Binance, BitMEX and OKex peaked at $1.847 Billion, almost twice (+95%) the previous liquidation high set on 22 Feb. What is notable is how quickly Bitcoin market derivatives clear excessive leverage, with this entire liquidation event settling and clearing within a one hour window.
Futures Long Liquidations Live Chart
The funding rate for perpetual swap contracts fell well into negative territory, hitting a new cycle low for this bull market at -0.017% (average is weighted by exchange open interest). Previous instances of futures funding rates resetting to zero, or going slightly negative, have indicated a significant flush of leverage has occurred, and is often constructive for price in the weeks that follow.
Futures Funding Rates Live Chart
On-chain Sentiment Overview
In the on-chain space, the Short Term Holder (STH) SOPR metric has also reset, dipping below 1.0 by the most significant extent since the $29k dip in back January. This metric tracks the amount of profit (> 1.0) or loss (< 1.0) realised by coins spent on-chain, however it considers only new entrants to the market (those
holding coins younger than 155-days
).
As the STH-SOPR has reset to a value below 1.0, it suggests that some of these new coin holders were shaken out at a loss during this dip. However a low SOPR also signals that new holders who are in profit were not shaken out, indicating relative market strength.
Similar to the futures funding rate, resetting the SOPR metric has historically been constructive for price in bull markets.
STH-SOPR Live Chart
Looking at older coins, we can see that both the CDD and Dormancy metrics ticked upwards slightly this week, however both remain within the relatively stable range established since mid-January. Both of these metrics track the age of spent coins and will increase when older coins are spent on-chain. This is a trend that is worth keeping an eye on as any strong continuation to the upside may indicate older coins are starting to take profits on a more significant basis.
CDD and Dormancy Comparison Chart
The LTH-SOPR metric tells a similar story and shows that old coins have been realising profits during the consolidation throughout March and April. Intermittent spikes in LTH-SOPR indicate profits were realised by long term holders which can increase the liquid supply, as dormant coins are re-activated in to circulation.
However during this weekend's sell-off, long term holders did not panic sell, and held onto their coins. The LTH-SOPR also reset back to relative lows, last seen around the $43k local bottom set back in late February.
LTH-SOPR Live Chart
A potential risk associated with this weeks sell-off is that price has undercut the $53.5k level which defines the $1 Trillion valuation mark.
Price did see a strong bounce to close well above this threshold at $56,163. This puts the market back inside a strong cluster of volume moved on-chain. So far, BTC volume equivalent to 14.32% of the circulating supply has moved at prices above $53.5k.
Previous editions of this newsletter
discussed how this on-chain volume cluster is likely to provide strong support and help justify the $1 Trillion valuation (so far, this is the case). In this Trillion dollar support zone, 1.189M BTC has moved above $53.5k but below the current price of $57.0k (equivalent to 6.37% of circulating supply).
However, this zone may also define the cost basis for a large portion of the market, and it is possible that some of these coins becomes overhead supply should market sentiment shift negative. A larger sum of 1.485M BTC has transacted above the current price (equivalent to 7.95% of circulating supply). As such, this volume profile, alongside metrics that follow older coin spending behaviour, are key on-chain indicators to keep an eye on as this market correction plays out.
URPD Live Chart
Weekly Feature: New Market Entrants
This week the trend of retail participation in the market has continued to accelerate with the growth in new entities on-chain continuing in a parabolic rise. We define the growth in net entities as the change in unique address clusters that are created (new UTXOs) vs destroyed (coins spent).
Prior to November 2020 (before the rally back to last cycles $20k ATH), net entity growth was relatively stable, most likely describing regular 'sat stackers' and accumulators. Since then, we have seen a parabolic increase in new entrants appearing on-chain, with new highs set early this week.
Net Entities Growth Live Chart
If we review the median size of new UTXOs created on-chain, we can assess the 'typical investment size' of newer entrants. We can see that during the late 2020 accumulation phase, the median UTXO value was around 1M sats (0.01 BTC), equivalent to between $90 and $120.
As both price and net entity growth expanded upwards, the median UTXO value has decreased to 300k to 400k sats (3x fewer sats) but has increased in fiat value to between $180 and $220 (2x more dollars). This demonstrates an approximate increase in BTC purchasing power of ~600% whilst the 'typical investment value' has doubled in fiat terms relative to late 2020.
Median UTXO size in BTC and dollars Live Chart
Finally, retail lead speculation appears to be on the rise as is reflected in the recent out-performance of a large portion of the alt-coin market. One of the favoured trading venues for retail speculation is Binance which has seen the most significant BTC inflows of any major exchange.
The BTC balance held on Binance balance has been in a steady increase since price broke above $20k, but has accelerated in the last two weeks, suggesting increased retail speculation.

Bitcoin price continued to slide this week, opening at a high of $57,425 and trading down to an intra-day low of $47,159 over the weekend. Despite weak price performance, on-chain data indicates old coins remain tightly held, miners have recommenced accumulation and the majority of transaction demand is coming from short term holders.
Both on-chain transaction volume and fees peaked to new all-time highs this week whilst the typical age of spent coins has fallen back to levels not seen since price was below $20k. Overall this suggests this correction has largely affected relatively newer entrants to the market and strong hands remain strong.
On-chain Activity Peaks
The Bitcoin network has been working through mempool congestion resulting from
last weeks drop in hash-rate
, coupled with increased demand for block-space during this price correction. This week, both on-chain transfer volume and average transaction fees hit new all time highs, eclipsing the peaks set in December 2017.
Network congestion pushed the average USD denominated transaction fee to a new high of $54.40 this week.
Mean Transaction Fees Live Chart
The 7-day moving average of transfer volume (change adjusted) reached new highs of over $50.9 Billion settled on a daily basis, almost 25% higher than the previous ATH. The network has now consistently settled more than $10B in transfer volume per day for a 136-day ¬†period, exceeding the peak duration observed in the 2017 bull market.
Change Adjusted Transfer Volume Live Chart
In likely response to high on-chain fees, the number of daily active addresses declined by around 10% this week, from the typical range of 1.0M to 1.2M seen throughout this bull market to approximately 980k addresses.
Active Addresses Live Chart
New Holders are Shaken Out
Investigating the Spent Output Age bands, we can ¬†establish a view on the typical age brackets for coins spent this week. It can be seen that coins older than 1-month represent a very small and declining proportion of the total transaction flow. Conversely, the number of young coins (< 1-week old) being spent have seen an uptick towards the end of the week suggesting newer market entrants were shaken out during this correction.
Notably, coins older than 6-months (purple colours) have not seen a meaningful increase in spending since the correction back in February. Previous instances of similar spending behaviour was observed during the December 2020 consolidation, just before breaking to new ATHs, and during the first bull market correction in January.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
The Short Term Holder SOPR metric has also fallen to the lowest value seen during this bull market. This indicates that coins spent this week were at an aggregate loss relative to prices when they last moved. This metric provides further evidence that short term holders who purchased coins at higher prices have been shaken out during this correction. Deep and lengthy retraces of the SOPR metric has historically been constructive for price in a bull market, as panic sellers are exhausted and coins are transferred to stronger hands.
STH-SOPR Live Chart
Old Hands Hold Strong
The Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) metric provides a view on the aggregate age of coins spent each day. This week, the average coin age has fallen back to between 25 and 30-days. These are levels that have not been seen since the early-bull market in 2020. This downtrend in ASOL has persisted since mid-January suggesting that old hands remain confident despite volatility and higher prices creating incentive to take profits.
ASOL Live Chart
In fact, if we analyse a number of lifespan metrics, we can see a consistent trend of old coins remaining largely dormant leading to downtrends across all metrics. The charts below present three different lifespan metrics telling this cohesive story:
ASOL
represents the average age of all spent UTXOs (i.e. average age per transaction)
Dormancy
represents the average age per unit of BTC moved (i.e. average age per 1 BTC)
CDD
represents the total volume of coin-days destroyed (i.e. global total of lifespan spent that day)
As all three metrics are breaking down this week, it means the aggregate age of coins spent are younger than prior weeks. This reinforces the case that old hands are not spending their coins and this correction has largely affected newer market entrants.
Be sure to check out these metrics in the
Week On-chain Newsletter dashboard

Miners Resume Accumulation
Miners have returned to accumulation mode with their net position change reaching highs not seen since mid-2018. This is even more impressive given coin issuance was higher prior to the halving event in 2020. This may also reflect market maturity and the increase in opportunities for miners to finance their operations without selling coins via collateralised loans and other debt instruments.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
The total unspent miner supply also demonstrates how miners have returned to accumulation throughout March and April. Unspent supply is now over 1.8M BTC (note, this total includes Satoshi's unspent coins).
Unspent Miner Balance (BTC) Live Chart
In USD terms, unspent miner supply is currently valued at $88 Billion after hitting an all time high of $112 Billion prior to this price correction.
Miner Unspent Supply (USD) Live Chart
Finally, as a result of high Bitcoin transaction fees over the past weeks, the Fee Ratio Multiple dropped to around 3.5 as fees made up an increasingly large share of the total block reward. A declining Fee Ratio Multiple is a positive signal for network security as it suggests that fees are gradually taking over a bigger role in the security budget. The Bitcoin Fee Ratio Multiple has persisted at values around 7 to 8 throughout this bull market indicating fees account for around 12% to 15% of the total block reward.

Weekly Feature: Uniswap and Gas Fees
Transaction fees on Ethereum have come down substantially this week after a sustained period of average gas fees well above 100 Gwei. The average gas fees are currently around 60 to 75 Gwei representing a welcome reduction of transaction costs for Ethereum users. The primary driver for reduced fees is the increased the gas limit from 12.5M to 15.0M by miners, effectively allowing more transactions per block.
Ethereum Mean Gas Fees Live Chart
Traders on Uniswap have clearly welcomed these reduced gas fees as transaction counts spiked to a new all-time-high of 213k trades per day this week. This continues a steady uptrend that has been in play for much of 2021.
Uniswap Transaction Counts Live Chart
Uniswap trading volume has also continued trending higher this week, peaking above $1.8 Billion late last week. The reduced gas fees alongside correcting prices are clearly providing fresh opportunities for Uniswap traders.

Bitcoin price has bounced from the correction lows this week, opening at $49,077 and trading up to a high of $58,396. The rise of stablecoins has continued with the largest stablecoin Tether minting a new ATH, with a weekly supply increase of $1.48 Billion. This reinforces the position and strong demand for crypto-native fiat.
On-chain data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum indicate strong conviction to hold both assets remains, as coin maturation becomes increasingly evident, and network activity trends higher. The Ethereum chain in particular has seen a notable boost in economic activity following the gas limit increase, as gas prices fall and transaction volumes increase in response.
Stablecoin Supply Mints New ATHs
Stablecoins have become a foundational asset and preferred base trading pair across the entire industry, providing globally accessible and crypto-native fiat rails. Demand for the largest and centrally issued stablecoin Tether (USDT) has minted a new supply all-time-highs this week.
Tether outstanding supply has increased by $1.48 Billion (+3%) this week to reach a total minted supply of over $51.78 Billion.
USDT Circulating Supply Live Chart
Recent stablecoin inflows have pushed the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) down to a value of 13.4, which is approaching the all-time-low of 9.6. SSR has been persistently low during 2020 and 2021 as stablecoin supplies have grown proportional to the growth in Bitcoin valuation.
Low and decreasing SSR values indicate that the global stablecoin supply is becoming larger relative to the Bitcoin market cap. As the total supply of stablecoins increase, it suggests an increased 'buying power' of crypto-native capital that can be quickly exchanged and traded into BTC and other crypto-assets.
Stablecoin Supply Ratio Live Chart
Confirmation of Coin Maturation
The phenomena of Bitcoin maturation (the ageing of HODLed coins) has been discussed in
prior weeks
where we noted that coins older than
155-days
are reclassified to be Long Term Holder (LTH) coins.
Note: 155-days ago it was early November 2020, and price was rallying from $16k up to the $18k consolidation before breaking last cycles all-time-high.
We can observe these changes in coin proportions in various age brackets using the Realised Cap HODL waves. This metric will show colour bands increasing in thickness as coins mature or are spent into different age bands. We can see in the chart below that the proportion of coins maturing from 1-week to 6-months old has been growing since Nov-2020. These are coins accumulated in the early bull market that have remained dormant since (blue arrows).
Currently the age band for 3m-6m in particular is swelling suggesting many coins are approaching the 155-day Long Term Holder threshold indicating strong conviction to HODL.
Realised Cap HODL Waves Live Chart
We can confirm this observation looking at the LTH Net Position Change metric which presents the volume of coins crossing the 155-day age threshold over the past month. Since 8-April more coins have been maturing than were spent, and this metric hit a 6-month high this week of 96.5k/BTC maturing/month.
LTH Net Position Change Live Chart
The total BTC supply held by LTHs has also started trending higher after a period of net distribution and spending. This metric further reinforces that on aggregate, more coins are remaining dormant and HODLed by strong hands, than are being spent by LTHs to realise profits.
LTH Total Supply Held Live Chart
As a final note on the recent Bitcoin correction and HODLer conviction, the number of UTXOs in profit dipped to 90% in the last correction, the lowest value of this bull market. This indicates that at the bottom of the correction at $47k, over 10% of all UTXOs were at a loss. This is coincident with most of the major corrections in the 2017 bull market.
Despite this dip being the most significant in terms of overall coin supply being at a loss, Long Term Holders appear to be unshaken by the volatility.
Percent UTXOs in Profit Live Chart
Ethereum Supply Dynamics
On the Ethereum chain, we can assess the age of ETH coins using similar tools like the HODL waves, whilst also taking into account nuanced differences as they relate to the Ethereum network.
Bitcoin has a primary application as store of value, making coin dormancy a reasonable proxy for measuring HODLer conviction. Ethereum however represents a far more active financial ecosystem, where long term holders may also deploy their HODLed coins in and out of smart contracts and applications. As such, ETH dormancy and age is only part of the equation.
First we review the Ethereum HODL waves to observe dormant coin behaviour. We can see a very similar trend exists to Bitcoin whereby coins appear to be maturing from 1-week to over 6-months old since late 2020 (blue arrows). It can also be seen that the proportion of coins aged 1-month to 6-months are progressively increasing in thickness suggesting HODLing coins accumulated in the early bull market remains a favoured strategy.
Ethereum HODL Waves Live Chart
As noted, the use of ETH coins within the Ethereum ecosystem is a key to understanding the behaviour of the network. This week a relatively large volume of ETH was removed from known exchange wallets, spiking to over 200k ETH in a single day. The chart below demonstrates that in 2021, there have been 10 such occurrences with withdrawals of over 200k ETH/day. This compares to only two days with exchange inflows over 200k ETH per day indicating a general preference for self-custody of funds.
ETH Exchange Net Flow Live Chart
Not only are ETH coins being withdrawn from centralised exchanges, they are undoubtedly finding their way into smart contracts and DeFi applications. The chart below compares the percent of total ETH supply held by exchanges (orange, 12.0%) compared to deposited in smart contracts (blue, 22.8%). The almost equal and opposite trend for these curves demonstrates a clear product market fit and demand for DeFi by ETH holders.
Exchange Balance vs Smart Contract Supply Live Chart
Following the Ethereum miners increasing the block gas limit to 15M, the overall throughput of the Ethereum chain has reached a new all-time-high this week of 16.5 transactions per second. The prior all-time-high of 13.5 TPS was set at the peak of the 2017 bull run which has since been eclipsed for the majority of 2021.
Finally we inspect the Ethereum NVT ratio, a metric that compares the network market cap to the USD value settled by the chain. Consider the following framework for interpretation of the NVT ratio:
NVT Uptrends
are more bearish, indicating transaction flows are getting smaller relative to market cap and the network may be over-valued.
NVT Downtrends
are more bullish, indicating transaction volumes are increasing relative to the market cap and the network may be under-valued.
NVT Trading Sideways
are supportive of the prevailing trend, indicating transaction volumes and market cap are growing equally and network may be fairly valued.
The chart below demonstrates an Ethereum NVT trending strongly downwards since Jan 2020, especially since the sell-off in March 2020. Recent high transaction throughput has also driven the NVT Ratio lower over the past few weeks suggesting support for the recent constructive price action.

Bitcoin's On-chain Market Cycles
Last week we released our second collaboration article with Bitcoin Magazine with a focus on the cyclical spending patterns of Hodlers, Speculators and miners. This article aims to provide a foundational roadmap with key metrics that help measure where we are in the Bitcoin market cycle.
All market cycles are unique, but the human response to profit, loss and incentives can be strangely predictable. The trick is knowing what to look for in the data, on-chain.

Bitcoin price continued to grind higher this week, rallying from lows of $53,333 to an intra-day high of $59,454. Price remains within the 'Trillion Dollar' consolidation range established since early February, as the market gets comfortable with a market cap sporting four commas.
On-chain signals continue to support strong HODLing demand from both miners and long term holders as overall spending patterns remain bullish. However there are also indications that a portion of BTC capital is rotating, with signals that ETH being a primary beneficiary.
Bitcoin Grinds Higher
After falling below the $1 Trillion market cap level (~$53,475) during the recent correction, the Bitcoin market has bid the price back above a major on-chain support level. We can see this in the URPD metric, which is constructed to show the volume of supply transacted within various price zones.
We can consider these as price levels where BTC changed hands, creating a new cost basis for buyers, and levels where profit or loss was realised for sellers. The price zone above the $1 Trillion Threshold is the most significant on-chain support since $11k and the market is currently at the top end of this range.
BTC volume equivalent to 12.1% of circulating supply (2.93M BTC) now forms on-chain support below the current price. A far smaller volume of 0.678M BTC (3.63% of supply) was moved above the current price which may form possible resistance.
URPD Live Chart
Supply held by Miners and OTC Desks
Miners have returned to coin accumulation in a significant way throughout April and May, with the net change in miner balances going green. This metric is calculated by looking at the net change to miner balances over a trailing 30-day window.
This metric currently shows that miners are not only net accumulating, they are doing so at an increasing rate, suggesting strong conviction and bullish sentiment.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
If we zoom out and apply a 14-day moving average (equal to the difficulty adjustment period), we can see that the current rate of miner accumulation is actually historically significant. The current net position change compares to only three instances in the last five years.
At a rate of 6,000 BTC accumulated per month (after the halving no less), this suggests miners are HODLing around 22% of the block subsidy issuance over the same period (900 BTC/day x 30-days = 27k BTC/mth).
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
Since miners are often closely associated with OTC desks for distribution of mined coins, we can review the trend of OTC desk to estimate the balance of incoming demand from large buyers.
The total balance held by the three OTC desks we track has continued to decline throughout 2021, reaching local lows of only 6k BTC this week. This suggests demand by larger buyers exceeds available supply at these OTC desks. Furthermore, this trend clearly commenced starting in Dec 2020 at which time miners were distributing heavily. This aligns with the strong growth in institutional interest in the asset as a macro scale investment.
OTC Desk Holdings Live Chart
HODLing with a Hint of Capital Rotation
The current consolidation range has many on-chain similarities to the market during 2020 which was largely a period of accumulation. The Binary CDD metric (7-day moving average) shows the trend and spending behaviour of older coins, providing a proxy estimate for what the smart money are doing.
A summary of the last ~12 months:
Jun-Oct 2020: Binary CDD traded sideways
indicating older coins were generally dormant and accumulation was underway.
Oct-Dec 2020: Binary CDD trends higher
indicating old coins were spent at an increasing rate to realise profits after the break above $20k ATH.
Jan-Mar 2021: Binary CDD trends lower
as confidence and market conviction returns, and old coins slow down their spending.
Mar-May 2021: Binary CDD trades sideways again
indicating that old coins are relatively dormant and the market has returned to HODLing and re-accumulation mode.
However, it should be noted that Binary CDD is trading at a higher level to mid 2020 suggesting spending of old coins is still happening.
Binary CDD Live Chart
The HODLed or lost coins metric tells a similar story, however it explains more about the current period. This metric measures the estimated supply that is either HODLed or lost and we can see:
Very clear accumulation and balance growth in mid to late 2020,
Strong spending in late 2020,
A slow down in spending in early 2021.
These observations align well with the Binary CDD observations above.
In the current period however (March 2021 to today), this HODLed balance has traded sideways (not upwards as expected for accumulation), with short bursts of spending. Whilst this confirms older BTC are generally dormant and maintain bullish market confidence, the ongoing accumulation is being offset by a slightly larger distribution.
HODLed or Lost Coins Live Chart
If we look the the BTC balance on the two largest exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, we get a strong hint as to where these spent BTC are heading.
Coinbase balances continue to trend lower
in a 'stair stepping pattern', indicating US institutional interest remains in play.
Binance balances have continued to grow
throughout 2021, and since early April, have actually started growing faster then Coinbase is depleting.
Given Binance is a preferred venue for retail speculation and has some of the most liquid altcoin markets, it is very likely that recent spending of BTC is indicative of capital rotation, as traders take advantage of altcoin volatility whilst Bitcoin prices consolidate.

As if it was not obvious already, ETH (...and DOGE) has been a primary recipient of a good portion of this capital rotation, with extraordinary price performance over the last three weeks. To demonstrate this effect, we can plot the spending behaviour of reasonably old Bitcoin UTXOs, between 6m and 3y, and compare it to the ETH price chart.
Whilst this is only an empirical observation (correlation <> causation), the distinct increase in these older BTC being spent back into circulation after a prolonged period of holding makes a compelling case. ETH prices have almost doubled in this time from $2,200 to an ATH of $4,000.
BTC Spent Output Ages and ETH Price Live Chart
We can see the relative magnitude of this capital rotation in the Spent Output Age bands where there is a noticeable uptick in old BTC spending behaviour starting in mid April as BTC price consolidates.
Bitcoin SOAB Live Chart
Activity on the Ethereum chain has increased significantly over the past weeks, indicating on-chain economic flows support this rally in price. The chain has seen a strong uptick across the board of many metrics including total number of smart contract calls, uniswap transactions, total transaction rate and USD settled in ETH transfers, just to name a few.
Ethereum Metrics Live Dashboards
Finally, the Ethereum chain has hit another on-chain ATH for daily transaction counts, as the increased gas limit provides a boost in maximum transaction throughput. A daily ATH of 1.63M transactions was achieved this week, representing a 22.5% increase over the previous peak, set just before the 2017 macro top.

Bitcoin's On-chain Market Cycles
Last week we released our second collaboration article with Bitcoin Magazine with a focus on the cyclical spending patterns of Hodlers, Speculators and miners. This article aims to provide a foundational roadmap with key metrics that help measure where we are in the Bitcoin market cycle.
All market cycles are unique, but the human response to profit, loss and incentives can be strangely predictable. The trick is knowing what to look for in the data, on-chain.

2021,20,2021-W20,2021-05-17,2021-05-23,Bullish,43580.50,34758.67,39052.71,-20.24,Disagree,"Bitcoin price has traded down over 26.1% this week as the market reacts to a series of tweets released by Elon Musk expressing concerns over the power consumption of Proof-of-Work mining. The market opened the week at high of $59,463 before trading down to $43,963 as the twitter saga unfolded.
Elon's tweets range from claims of
negative externalities from energy consumption
, ¬†to claims that
10x faster and larger blocks on Dogecoin
are a viable alternative. Unfortunately, this has lead to widespread confusion in markets, although for many Bitcoin HODLers, this is just another day in the office.
On-chain we can observe a notable bifurcation of reactions, with newer market entrants panic selling and realising losses, whilst long term hodlers appear relatively un-phased by the news. There are many supply and demand dynamics that resemble the 2017 macro top however with unique differences that will challenge the conviction of both bulls and bears.
Sizing up the Correction
First up, we will assess the scale of this correction compared to the 2017 and 2021 Bull markets. The current correction is now over 28% below the $63.6k ATH set on 13-April. This is the deepest correction of the current bull market, however is consistent with five major pull-backs during the 2017 bull.
In terms of bull market duration, the 2021 primary bull (where new ATHs are set frequently) has run for around 200-days, which is relatively short compared to the year long bull run in 2017.
Drawdown from ATH Live Chart
The number of entities that are currently in profit provides insight into the cross section of the market that is underwater. We can observe that this correction has lead to over 23% of on-chain entities (unique, separate wallets) being at a loss, which compares to only three up-trending periods since 2016. Note that all of these comparative pullbacks were associated relatively extreme events:
2016 first pullback of the disbelief rally off the bottom, following 2yr bear market.
2019 first pullback of the disbelief rally out of a 1.5yr bear market, driven mostly by leveraged short sellers getting squeezed.
2020 Consolidation following global uncertainty after the 12-March COVID sell-off.
Percent Entities in Profit Live Chart
New Entrants Panic Sell
Newer market entrants have panic sold and realised significant loses on their coins, with both the aSOPR and STH-SOPR dipping below 1.0 once again. Both of these metrics consider the degree of profit realised by coins moving on-chain, with higher values indicating profitable coins were on the move, and values below 1.0 indicating most coins were last moved at higher prices.
The aSOPR metric considers the entire market, whilst also filtering out all coins with a lifespan less than 1hr (which are generally temporary hops and thus economically unimportant). The STH-SOPR filters for only coins younger than 155-days and is therefore representative of entities who bought coins during the current bull market cycle.
Both metrics have fallen below 1.0 indicating aggregate losses have been realised on-chain, an effect most pronounced in the STH-SOPR. This is the second major dip below 1.0 for STH-SOPR during this correction, suggesting widespread panic selling by new holders.
aSOPR and STH-SOPR Live Chart
The total count of addresses holding a non-zero BTC balance has also pulled back by -2.8% from the recent all time high of 38.7M addresses. A total of 1.1M addresses have spent all coins they held during this correction, again providing evidence that panic selling is currently underway.
Non-Zero Addresses Live Chart
If we observe the cyclical pattern of total supply held by short term holders (STH), we can also see that a pattern of panic selling is playing out, similar to that observed at the 2017 macro peak. What this chart shows is that the Bitcoin market tends to find a local or macro peak at a time when new holders own a relatively large proportion of the total supply (i.e maximum coin supply held by newer weaker hands).
However, it is important to note that the current peak in STH owned coins is substantially lower than 2017 in both coin volume and as a percentage of circulating supply. New holder coins recently reached 28% of circulating supply (5.3M BTC) which is 9% less than at the 2017 top.
Given Bitcoin trades at much larger market valuation this may be a reflection of the larger capital inflows that are required to gain ground in market cap size. It may also provide an indication that this may be a larger time-frame pull-back in a bull cycle, as weak hands capitulate, and stronger hands recommence their accumulation of cheaper coins.
Supply Held by Short Term Holders Live Chart
Exchange Flow Dynamics
Supporting our observation of panic selling, aggregate exchange BTC inflows hit a significant high, with a net inflow of 27.5k BTC observed at the start of this latest leg down of the correction. This compares in scale only to the March 2020 sell-off and the distribution by the PlusToken ponzi scheme in 2019.
All exchanges Net Flows Live Chart
However, if we break down this observation into the two largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, we can see two different realities.
Binance largely captures non-US entities and is a preferred venue for retail speculators and investors and was the receiver for the lions share of this net inflow. It can also be seen that the magnitude of both inflows and outflows has increased over the past few months suggesting volatility in Binance user macro sentiment. This provides further indication that the recent inflows are likely to be driven by both new market entrants (panic sellers) and potentially due to capital rotation into other crypto-assets.
Binance Net-flows Live Chart
Conversely, Coinbase has seen almost entirely net outflows of BTC since breaking last cycles $20k ATH, a trend that has continued this week. Coinbase is the preferred venue for US institutional accumulation, and given the scale of typical daily of withdrawals (10k to 20k BTC/day), it suggests that larger buyers remain in active accumulation during this correction.
Coinbase Net-flows Live Chart
Long Term Holders are Buying this Dip
In almost perfect opposition to new entrants panic selling, long term holders appear to be buying the dip and accumulating cheaper coins. Whilst the count of non-zero addresses has fallen during this correction, the number of addresses that are in accumulation have increased by 1.1% since the recent low. Accumulation addresses are defined as those which have at least two incoming transactions but have never spent any coins.
Accumulation Addresses Live Chart
Similarly, the supply held by long term holders (LTH) has returned to accumulation mode, a pattern that again resembles the 2017 macro top. What this chart is largely reflective of are buyers who purchased coins in late 2020/Jan 2021 and have not spent their coins. As the supply of LTHs starts to rise, it indicates that the volume of coins maturing beyond 5 months of dormancy, exceeds the volume old coins that are spent to realise profits.
The current LTH owned supply is over 2.4M BTC (8% a proportion of circ. supply) more than it was at the 2017 peak. This indicates that a large volume of coins have moved to and remain in illiquid cold storage and this trend is continuing.
Long-Term Holder Supply Live Chart
Overall, the Bitcoin market is in a historically significant correction. There are strong signals that short term holders are leading with panic selling, however long term holders are stepping in to buy the dip and their confidence is largely unshaken. The PoW energy consumption narrative is nuanced to say the least, and what follows will be a test for the whole Bitcoin market's conviction.

The market traded down by over 47% from the weekly high of $59,463, to lows of $31,327. This weekly candle is now the single largest in total price range in history, a whopping $28,136 candle.
Price action was heavily driven by what can only be described as a FUD-bath, with topics pulled form every chapter in the Bitcoin critics textbook as @nlw summarises. This sell-off has been so severe that it has raised the question in many minds as to whether the 2021 Bull Market remains in play. This week we will review the scale of the correction and the response from various entities observable on-chain.

A Capitulation for the History Books
The magnitude of realised losses on-chain this week has, eclipsed all previous capitulation events, including March 2020, Nov 2018 and the sell-off that ended the last bull market in Jan-Feb 2018.
The chart below presents the USD value of losses realised by spent coins and shows that a new ATH of $4.53B in losses was hit on 19-May. This is higher than the previous spikes in Mar 2020 and Feb/Apr 2021 by over 300% and is the peak from a total weekly realised loss of $14.2B.
Realised Loss Live Chart
Accounting for profitable coins that were spent, this capitulation event is still the largest net realised loss by a significant margin. Over $2.56B in net losses were taken on-chain on 19-May, a sum that is 185% larger than the March 2020 COVID sell-off. The chart below shows that this capitulation follows a strong period of net profit taking (green spikes) so could be considered an equal an opposite reaction to the downside.
What this indicates is that a very large cross section of the market was taken by surprise by this event.
Net Realised Profit/Loss
These net losses on-chain have resulted in a decline in the Realised Cap, as coins purchased higher are revalued to lower prices. The Realised Cap has declined by $7B (-1.8%) this week from its all time high of $377B.
Realised Cap Live Chart
Looking at the number of unique entities on-chain who are now in profit, we can see that the current FUD-bath has reduced profitable entities to 76%. This means that 24% of all on-chain entities are currently holding UTXOs that are underwater. In a bull market context, this compares to three periods in 2011, 2013 and 2016. This metric also highlights the proportion of the market who purchased coins higher and thus who may become panic sellers.
Entities in Profit Live Chart
Analysis of the Sellers
There are three primary groups of entities that are likely to generate sell-side supply:
Coin holders at a Loss
who are largely buyers from the last 3-4months.
Coin holders in Profit
who may believe the macro top is in.
Miners
who need to sell to cover costs or are forced due to new Chinese regulations.
There is no question that a large portion of the recent spending activity was driven by short term holders, those owning coins purchased within the last 6-months. The spent output age bands shows that the 1m-3m and 3m-6m age brackets in particular spiked substantially higher than the typical baseline leading into, and during the sell-off.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
If we compare this to the equivalent spending by longer term investors, particularly those with coins 1y-3y old (last cycles buyers) we see the opposite picture. Holders of coins aged 1y-3y were actually spending their coins much earlier,
likely rotating capital
to capture the price out-performance of ETH at that time.
During this capitulation sell-off however, the spending of 1y-3y old coins was actually significantly less and declining as a proportion of total activity. This suggests that old hands did not panic sell nor rush for the exits.
HODLers Live Dashboard
A major question that remains is what is the magnitude of unrealised losses, or in other words, how many underwater coins could still panic sell out? We inspect the Relative Unrealised Losses metric which presents the ratio between total underwater value and the current market cap.
Using this metric, we can see that around 9.0% to 9.5% of the current market cap ($700B) exists as unrealised losses, equal to around $65B in underwater value. Despite this being a historical capitulation event, relative to the market size, the value of underwater positions on-chain is actually relatively small. We can compare this to relative unrealised losses of 44% in March 2020 and over 114% in Nov 2018.
Note that prior to a major sell-off, coins that were purchased higher have essentially 'stored value' at a higher market cap. After the sell-off, the new market cap is lower and thus it is possible to achieve > 100% relative unrealised losses.
Relative Unrealised Losses Live Chart
Across the aggregate market, the Net Unrealised Profit and Loss metric has pulled back to just below 0.5 indicating that the market currently holds an aggregate of 50% of the Bitcoin market cap in profitable coins. This level has acted as a support in all three of the prior bull cycles and this is actually the first touch in the 2021 market.
NUPL Live Chart
If we filter out for short term holders however, we can see that a major capitulation has occurred. Short term holders currently hold an aggregate unrealised loss of -33.8% of the Market Cap on their coins. This compares only to the most extreme draw-downs in Bitcoin history including:
The first Bull top in 2013
Three events in the 2014-15 bear
Four events in the 2018 bear
March 2020 capitulation
STH-NUPL Live Chart
On the miner front, there are anecdotal indicators that miner sell pressure may increase in the short term as a result of changes to the mining industry in China.
4, Were miners selling Bitcoin? Some already panic sold, others had no choice. Not everyone have access to western hosting sites. There are also added level of uncertainty on current RMB OTC trading channels. Need fiat to cover operational costs at end of the day.

May 23, 2021
Observing the spending of miner coins demonstrates that whilst there is an uptick in miner-to-exchange flows, up from 100 BTC/day to 300BTC/day, this still represents a relatively small portion of the ~900BTC/day issuance.
Miner to Exchange Flows Live Chart
The Miner Net Position Change metric confirms this is the case. We can see a slight decline in aggregate accumulation this week, however the rate of 'mined and held' coins remains a larger share relative to those that are 'mined and sold'. It remains to be seen if miners begin spending more of their coins as these changes roll out.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
Exchanges and Derivatives
Finally, we investigate the impact this week has had on exchange flows, balances and the leveraged derivatives markets.
There was a distinct increase in net deposits to exchanges, both in the weeks leading into, and during the sell-off. Peak net inflows spiked above +30k BTC/day on 17-May. At the same time, the magnitude of outflows has been increasing steadily the lower price falls, suggesting that there remain buyers of last resort even as the wider market capitulates.
Exchange Net-flows Live Chart
An interesting observation is that a bifurcation of the exchange market is underway in terms of which exchanges are increasing their BTC balances. The majority of exchanges have actually seen relatively flat to declining balances over the past weeks. Aside from a small increase during this weeks sell-off, these exchanges have effectively maintained an uninterrupted balance downtrend since March 2020.
Exchange Balances Live Chart
There are however three exchanges that have received almost all of the net inflows observed: Binance, Bittrex and Bitfinex. The balance on these three exchanges has been increasing throughout 2021, although Binance leads with the lions share of inflows. During this sell-off however, all three exchanges saw significant increases to their held BTC balance.
Given all three of these exchanges service clients outside the US, this may suggest a difference in response between markets in different jurisdictions. Another explanation is that Binance in particular hosts a large catalogue of trading markets, derivatives, and is the gateway to Binance Smart Chain, a preferred venue for recent retail speculation.
Finally, on derivatives markets, open interest on Bitcoin futures has seen a tremendous decline from the ATH set in April. Open Interest across all futures markets has declined by over $16.4B (down 60%) from the peak and now returned to levels last seen in February 2021.
Futures open Interest Live Chart
Options markets have seen a similar significant decline with total outstanding contracts down 52% from the peak to $6.4B, returning again to levels last seen in February.
Overall, this flush of speculation and leverage is a healthy and necessary process, as it removes excessive speculation and forced sellers to allow more organic price action to return down the road.

2021,22,2021-W22,2021-05-31,2021-06-06,Bullish,37279.31,35800.48,36998.18,-3.97,Disagree,"This week the Bitcoin price has consolidated within a $9,430 trading range. Price opened the week at a low of $31,327, hit a local high of $40,757, before trading back towards the lows. A period of consolidation is to be expected as the market comes to terms with the dramatic sell-off last week.
The primary question on investors minds is whether a bear market trend is in play, or whether the market has returned to a re-accumulation range. In this newsletter we will assess the on-chain spending behaviour of Short- and Long-term coin holders to gauge their relative sentiment.
Approaching the Pain Threshold
The current market structure is quite intriguing, as the Bitcoin price 5 months ago (our threshold for Long-term Holders,
155-days
) is only slightly below current prices. As such, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) more or less represent all profitable coins (accumulated prior to 2021) with buyers from late December/early January at or near their cost basis. Conversely, Short-Term Holders (STHs) represent almost all coins that are at an unrealised loss.
Using statistical means
, we established these two classes of coin-holders based on the time since a coin was last moved:
Short-Term Holders (STH)
, generally assumed to be relatively new market entrants holding coins younger than 155-days.
Long-Term Holders (LTH)
generally assumed to be hodlers, smart money and buyers of last resort holding coins older than 155-days.
Using this classification, we establish the proportion of supply that is held by STH vs LTH and further by how many of those coins are currently in profit or at a loss. As the current trading price range is very close to the prices 155-days ago, we can also see that a small proportion of LTHs are now underwater shown in the light blue zone in the chart below.
Relative LTH vs STH Profit and Loss Live Chart
Key statistics regarding the current supply dynamics in the chart above:
LTHs in profit (dark blue)
hold 69% of all BTC supply. This essentially represents all buyers before 2021.
LTHs in loss (light blue)
hold 0.5% of all BTC supply capturing buyers from the final days of 2020 and early January. Should price continue to range in this zone for say 1-month (or fall lower), the thickness of this light blue zone will indicate how many buyers from January continue to HODL their coins.
LTHs overall (white arrow)
have returned to accumulation. This suggests that early bull market buyers (prices < $30k) have HODLed a reasonable volume of supply, and should this trend continue, may indicate a longer term supply squeeze is in play.
STHs in profit (dark red)
hold only 4.5% of BTC supply, having fallen dramatically from over 30% in mid-April at the $64k ATH.
This suggests that around 26% of the coin supply is currently underwater.
STHs at a loss (light red)
therefore hold 26% of supply at an unrealised loss. This group are the most likely source of sell-side pressure now and into the future.
In our latest insights piece,
we discuss the Net Unrealised Profit and Loss for both groups to establish their relative pain points. Our assessment is that STHs have capitulated a large volume of coins, however may continue to be a source of sell-side supply moving forwards. LTHs on the other hand remain largely in profit, however are approaching the NUPL threshold of 0.75. In previous cycles, this has signalled the start of more bearish trends as LTHs capture remaining unrealised gains.
Week On-chain Live Dashboard
Spending Patterns Matter
From the above, we can see plenty of Bitcoin investors are underwater and things may seem pretty grim.
However, now that we have established potential pain points for the market, we can observe actual spending behaviours on-chain to verify whether investors are taking action on paper losses, or are being spooked by red candles.
The Average Spent Output Lifespan metric (ASOL) provides insight into the average age of all UTXOs spent that day. In the chart below, we have applied a 7-day EMA to emphasise recent spending behaviour whilst also smoothing out daily noise.
High ASOL values mean old coins are on the move and distributing.
Low ASOL values suggest old coins remain HODLed and dormant.
There are a two key observations related to recent price action:
Older coins saw a spike in spending behaviour in early May, likely in part distribution (smart money may have anticipated weakness) and also capital rotation (ETH doubled in price during this time).
During the sell-off, ASOL fell dramatically, back to levels below the accumulation range seen between $50k and $60k. This indicates LTHs did not panic sell and capitulate and instead primarily HODLed through the dip.
ASOL Live Chart
Two more lifespan metrics, Coin-Days Destroyed and Dormancy tell a similar story. Older coins appear to remain dormant (low values) despite prices falling 50% from ATH.
CDD
represents the total lifespan spent by coins that day.
Dormancy
corrects CDD for on-chain volume showing spent lifespan per unit BTC.
High value are generally bearish
as old coins are spent and distributed.
Low values are generally bullish
as old coins remain dormant and accumulation takes place.
Dormancy + CDD Live Chart
As seen in ASOL, the total amount of lifespan that is being spent has actually fallen at or below 2020 pre-bull market levels. This confirms that old coins are holding onto their stack, and the majority of spending is by holders of relatively young coins.
What these three metrics indicate is that older hands are not rushing for the exit. If ASOL/CDD/Dormancy continue to trend lower, it would be similar to previous accumulation ranges as old coins remain dormant and weak hands sell to strong hands. Conversely, if these metrics begin to trend higher, it may indicate older coins are being spent once again creating further sell pressure.

So Who is Selling?
So far we have established that old coins are spending less than usual. However price is falling and exchange balances are climbing. So the question is, who is the dominant driver of selling?
The
Liquid and Illiquid Supply metric
shows that throughout May, a total of 155k BTC have transitioned from an Illiquid state (HODLed) to Liquid or Highly Liquid state providing an estimate of the total 'sell pressure'. This will account for both LTHs and STHs who spent coins previously held by to wallets with heuristics similar to cold storage.
Liquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart
On-chain settlement in USD terms is also very close to ATH this week with over $55 Billion settled per day. This is 60% more volume than the 2017 peak. It is thus undeniable that a huge volume of coins are on the move.
Change Adjusted Volume Live Chart
If we review the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) filtered for Short-Term Holders, we can see that STHs continue to realise losses by spending coins accumulated higher, at current, lower prices. This metric will persist below 1.0 for long periods when there is widespread capitulation. With this in mind, current market structure is comparable with the March 2020 capitulation event.
STH-SOPR Live Chart
We can also review the amount of BTC transfer volume on-chain that is in profit (bought lower, LTHs) vs at a loss (bought higher, STHs). There are a number of key observations from the chart below which largely confirm the majority of spending and selling pressure is driven by short term holders:
Long-Term holders clearly took profits during the early 2020 rally from $10k to $42k after which their spending reached a fairly stable baseline.
Long-Term holder spending patterns appear unaffected by last weeks sell-off, and in fact the 'volatility' of spending volume has actually decreased. This indicates that LTHs are generally unwilling to liquidate coins at reduced prices.
Short-Term holders on the other hand increased their spending by over 5x during this sell-off with the maximum spending occurring near the current local low of the market.
BTC Transfer Volume in Profit or Loss Live Chart
Finally, we can compare the supply held by three key parties: Short-Term Holders (blue), Long-term Holders (green) and Miners (orange).
Short-Term holders are distributing.
Long-Term holders are HODLing and accumulating.
Miners are accumulating.
Without doubt, the current market structure is best described a battleground between the bulls and the bears with a clear trend forming between long term and short term investors. This is a battle of HODLer conviction and immediate buying power.

2021,23,2021-W23,2021-06-07,2021-06-13,Bullish,33575.91,39015.24,36140.99,16.20,Agree,"The Bitcoin market has seen a relatively quiet week, both in price action, and in demand for on-chain transactions and value settlement. Prices have traded within a narrow range between a high of $39,242, and down to a weekly low of $34,942.
Meanwhile, on-chain activity in active users, settled volume and transaction fees, across both the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols, have fallen back to levels observed in 2020 and early 2021. Mempool congestion has largely cleared as the market remains uncertain around the bullish or bearish bias of the current market structure.
Congestion Clears Completely
A characteristic of bull markets is a strengthening demand for on-chain transactions, value settlement, and urgency for inclusion in an upcoming block. The net result is that activity, transaction volumes and priority fees spike higher. This is a result of both increased demand from investors, and the incentive for older hands to spend their coins into strength at higher prices. This week in particular, the growth in on-chain demand has slowed markedly, with a number of on-chain metrics showing significant pull-backs.
Since January 2021, the number of active Bitcoin addresses has sustained a level around 1.15M addresses per day, coincident with the 2017 peak. It should be noted that in 2017, this level was reached for only a few days, before collapsing over 33% during the first sell-off. The present cycle sustained this high on-chain activity for 5-months.
During the recent sell-off, the Bitcoin network experienced a reduction in active addresses, down 18% from the recent highs to around 0.94M. This fall is around half the reduction seen in 2017, indicating that whilst activity has slowed, more demand exists than after previous cycle macro tops (or perhaps there is further to go...).
Active Addresses Live Chart
The number of active entities has similarly pulled back, retracing from a high of 375k to around 250k unique on-chain entities. This is again coincident with values observed in late-2017 to early 2018 as interest in the asset wanes with falling prices.
The key difference between 'entities' and 'addresses' is our use of clustering algorithms to establish when a single entity (such as an exchange, miner or a regular accumulator) may own multiple addresses, thus providing a more accurate view of unique 'users'.
Active Entities Live Chart
The total USD denominated transfer volume settled by the Bitcoin network has pulled back by a whopping 65% in the last two weeks. Change-adjusted transfer volume fell from over $43B/day down to $15B/day. Again, the 2017 aftershock is the only event of comparable scale where on-chain settled volume fell by 80% over a period of around 3 months.
Change Adjusted Transfer Volume (USD) Live Chart
Bitcoin is not alone in seeing this decline in on-chain activity. Ethereum USD denominated transfer volume dropped by over 60% in the last two weeks. The comparable decline in 2018 was far more extreme at -95%, however it remains to be seen whether this lull in demand is temporary, or a sign of things to come.
Ethereum transfer Volume Live Chart
As demand for on-chain transactions fall, the average transaction fee paid has similarly reduced for both networks. All time high mean transaction fees were reached in April and May, with short term spikes reaching over $60 for both protocols. Mean fees for both networks have now returned to mid-2020 levels of of around $3.50 to $4.50.
By almost all on-chain activity metrics, the recent month has been a historically large decline, transitioning rapidly from booming on-chain economies at ATH prices, to almost completely clear mempools and waning demand for transactions and settlement.
BTC vs ETH Mean Transaction Fees (USD) Comparison Chart
Supply Dynamics
Over the last month, a total volume of 160.7k BTC has been spent from an illiquid state back into liquid circulation. This provides a gauge of the amount of overhead supply that has re-entered the market after being classified as illiquid by our analytics and heuristics (
see more detail in this article
).
What is important to node is that this 160.7k BTC represents just 22% of the supply that moved the other direction, from liquid to illiquid, since March 2020. This means that of the 744k BTC that were withdrawn to cold storage (or equivalent) over the last 14-months, 78% of them have remained unspent despite this recent volatility.
The total number of addresses with a non-zero BTC balance has declined throughout May, dropping by a total of 1.2M addresses. Unlike transaction demand and other activity metrics, which fell 60%+, the decline in non-zero addresses (which are effectively spending all owned coins) has only declined by 3% from ATH. Compared to the 2017 peak, where we saw almost a quarter of addresses spend their coins, this is a relatively small net change.
What it does suggest is that some portion of the market is spending their full balance from owned addresses suggesting a shift in conviction for that portion of the market.
Non-zero Balance Address Live Chart
We can compare two versions of the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric to see that a majority of those spending their coins are a) realising losses and b) are spent by Short-Term Holders. Some initial points on SOPR to interpret the next chart:
SOPR
values indicate the magnitude of profit (>1.0) or loss (<1.0) realised by the market. Larger peaks/troughs mean larger profits/losses realised.
aSOPR
variant considers the entire market. It does improve signal by filtering out relay transactions with a lifespan <1hr which are not economically meaningful.
STH-SOPR
variant filters only for coins spent that are younger than 155-days capturing new entrants to the market, and filtering out long-term holders.
The chart below compares
aSOPR
(whole market minus relay transactions) to
STH-SOPR
(new market entrants only). What we can see is that both are below 1.0 and thus spenders are realising losses in aggregate across the whole market. However, note that the STH-SOPR is well below aSOPR. This indicates that the magnitude of losses realised by newer market entrants are much larger than the market on average. The aSOPR metric being close to 1.0 indicates that any long term holders who are realising a profits are more or less offset by short-term holders realising losses.
Compare aSOPR to STH-SOPR Live Chart
The supply held by Long-term holders (LTHs) has started to accelerate upwards. The threshold for LTH status is UTXOs that are dormant for 155-days. As such, the next charts are largely describing investors who purchased between late 2020 and 3 January 2021, and have not spent their coins.
After a period of LTHs distributing coins, as the market rallied from $10k to the $64k ATH, the net change in LTH supply is now in a firm uptrend (HODLing behaviour). Yet again, we can see this fractal is similar to the late 2017 bull and early 2018 bear. This fractal describes the inflection point where LTHs stop spending, start re-accumulating and hodling what are now considered cheap coins.
LTH Position Change Live Chart
LTHs now own 10.9M BTC which represents over 58% of the circulating supply. It is worth noting that LTHs today own 2.3M more BTC (+8% of circulating supply) compared to the LTHs at the 2017 peak.
This does highlight an intuitive reality; higher coin prices require larger capital inflows to sustain bull market trends. It also shows that the distribution of fewer coins can put in local/macro market tops if the capital inflow demand is not there.
LTH Supply Live Chart
DeFi Activity Slows On-chain
The slow down in on-chain activity is, naturally, not limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Aggregate on-chain activity such as transfer counts (top) and USD value transferred (bottom) for COMP, AAVE, UNI and YFI tokens has dropped significantly in the last month. These metrics are simple yet reasonably effective as a high level gauge for mass investor sentiment and can be seen to map reasonably well to trends in price.
DeFi Metrics Live Dashboard
Finally, we can see in the number of daily Uniswap trade transactions has fallen by 28% since peaking in mid-May suggesting a slowing of demand for tokens. The daily transaction count for Uniswap has returned to its long term baseline of around 160k trades/day which has held since September 2020 amidst 'DeFi Summer'.

This week, Bitcoin was officially voted in as legal tender in El Salvador, a truly historic moment for the industry. It also appears likely that the next major source of mining energy will be sourced from volcanoes. Was this on your 2021 bingo card?

June 9, 2021
The week opened to relatively soft price performance, selling-off to a weekly low of $31,185. However, the market responded to the rapid passing of the bill in El Salvador with a rally back into the recent consolidation range, hitting an intra-day high of $39,269.
After becoming a distinguished macro-economic asset in 2020, it appears Bitcoin is transitioning out of the 'gradually' and into the 'suddenly' phase. This week, we investigate the on-chain behaviour of both short-term traders and long-term hodlers to the weekly events.
Profitable Supply Swings
The high volatility of Bitcoin markets makes it a magnet for traders, who are able to monetise price swings in both directions. Simultaneously, the powerful fundamental properties of Bitcoin make it a desirable store of value asset for long-term investors. During choppy and consolidating market structure, we can gain insight into the balance of supply and demand, and degree of accumulation by short and long-term holders, by observing changes in profitable supply during price swings.
Price rallied twice this week, first after El Salvador voted in the legal tender bill, and then again on Sunday afternoon. During both of these swings, the value held in profitable UTXOs jumped by around 1.5M BTC. Between both of these upswings, the weekly low of $31.7k to Sunday's high of $39.2k, a total of 1.985M BTC returned to an unrealised profit.
Whilst some of these coins are likely to those purchased back in January (similar price range) and remain unspent, we can estimate that at least 1.985M BTC (~10.5% of circ. supply) has an on-chain cost basis between $31.7k and $39.2k.
Total Supply In Profit Live Chart
We can reasonably assume that this newly profitable supply is broadly held by three different cohorts:
HODLers
who purchased coins in early Jan 2021 and have not spent them. These coins are currently maturing across the 155-day Long-Term Holder (LTH) threshold.
New HODLers
who are buying the dip in the current range and likely to hold throughout whatever volatility lies ahead (hard to isolate in the data for now).
Traders and Short-Term Holders
(STH) who are trading price swings and are more likely to liquidate at price targets or in downside volatility. They are also more likely to utilise derivative markets and leverage.
Traders Take Profits and Short Positions
Let's start with the last cohort, the
Traders and STHs
who are the most likely to generate overhead supply (sell pressure).
The chart below shows the amount of STH held supply in profit (green) and the STH-SOPR as a metric for the degree of profit taking (pink). There are two key observations here:
Following each spike in STH profitable supply during price rallies (green 1, 2, 3, 4), the STH-SOPR spikes and holds an elevated level soon after (matching pink 1, 2, 3, 4). This indicates that some portion of this STH cohort are likely taking profits on swing trades or being shaken out by intra-day price volatility.
During the price rally after the vote in El Salvador, around 737k BTC owned by STHs returned to profit (representing around 37% of the 1.985M from the last chart). As such, we can estimate that around 63% of coins with a cost basis in this price range are actually LTH owned coins purchased in January 2021, and 37% are recently accumulated.
STH Supply in Profit and STH-SOPR Live Chart
Staying with analysis of short-term traders, we can see that futures open interest is climbing, albeit slowly, especially compared to Q1 2021. Total open interest has fluctuated between $10B and $12B for the last month and remains down around $8B (40%) from the previous peak in mid-May.
Futures Open Interest Live Chart
Trading volume on futures has been similarly muted, particularly relative to the $120B in volume that occurred during the capitulation event in May. Around $15B in additional volume was traded in the days immediately following the vote in El Salvador. Trading volume is starting to trail off again over the second half of this week.
It certainly appears that traders in derivatives markets are unsure about the macro market direction and thus keeping leverage levels and volume relatively low.
Futures Volume Live Chart
On the perpetual futures funding rate, after turning extremely negative during the capitulation event, it has remained fairly neutral over the past month. Funding rates have oscillated between +0.005% and -0.010%.
Interestingly, on the two aforementioned price rallies, funding rates turned negative indicating that a more bearish bias exists with traders preferring to sell into the rallies.
Futures Funding Rates Live Chart
However, it is often the case that large funding rates provide a contrarian indicator, as it suggests many leveraged traders are leaning in the same direction. Whilst the above negative rates are not particularly large, there has been an outsized volume of short liquidations on all three instances.
Each time the funding rate (blue) has turned negative during the last months consolidation, price has rallied, and an increasing number of short positions are being liquidated (orange).
Futures Funding and Short Liquidations Live Chart
HODLers keep on HODLing
Let's turn our attention now to the long-term holder (LTHs) cohort who include all buyers of coins prior to 10 January 2021. The LTH net position change shows the net monthly rate of coins maturing across the 155-day threshold, accounting for any coins spent.
The chart below is marked up with the price range from 155-days ago ($13k to $42k) mapped onto the accelerating rate of those coins maturing today. What this indicates is that a very large volume of coins were purchased in the early bull market, and have remained largely unspent. The current rate of maturation is over 400k BTC/month which is much larger than the
~160k BTC we estimated were sold, mostly by STHs, during the May capitulation event
.
LTH Net Position Change
We can also see this coin maturation in the Realised Cap HODL waves, which present the relative proportion of coin supply that makes up the Realised Cap. Not only are we seeing a decline in very young coins (<1-month old)
due to the recent low on-chain volume
, we are also seeing an expanding share of coins aged between 3-months and 12-months old. These are those same HODLed coins that were accumulated throughout the 2020 to Jan 2021 bull market.
Realised Cap HODL Waves Live Chart
Some LTHs have and will take profits on their coins. What is common in all Bitcoin cycles is that LTHs spend a larger majority of their coins into the strength of bull rallies, and slow their spending on pull-backs as conviction returns. This behaviour can be seen in the LTH-SOPR which tracks the aggregate profit multiple realised by LTHs.
After peaking around 7.5x (LTHs realising 750% profits) in Mar-Apr, it can be seen that LTH's are realising declining profits during this price correction, even as price trades sideways. LTHs are currently realising profits with a multiple of 3.2x which suggests an aggregate cost basis of around $11.3k for their spent coins (7-day avg price $36.2k / 3.2 = $11.3k).
LTH SOPR Live Chart
A similar observation can be seen in the CDD-90 metric which plots the aggregate sum of coin-day destruction over the last 90-days. A decline in CDD-90 suggests that older coins (with large accumulated lifespans) are remaining unspent. This suggests that LTHs are not panic selling during this volatility and are therefore more likely to be re-accumulating than cashing out.
CDD-90 Live Chart
To confirm this even further, we inspect the Binary CDD metric with a 7-day moving average applied. The base Binary CDD metric will return a 1 or a 0 when the volume of coin-days destroyed is greater, or less than the long term average. With a moving average, we can see when trends develop of old coins being spent (uptrend/high values), or remaining dormant (downtrend/low values).
The Binary CDD metric has reached an extremely low value throughout June, coincident with the early 2020 start of the bullish trend. This indicates that Long term holders are simply not spending their coins.

2021,25,2021-W25,2021-06-21,2021-06-27,Bullish,31609.82,34709.23,33010.02,9.81,Agree,"The Bitcoin market continues to show relative weakness in both price and on-chain activity this week. Prices have traded within the recent consolidation range, marking down from an early week high of $41,295, to a low of $33,818 over the weekend.
On-chain activity across the board is remarkably low across Bitcoin and Ethereum, with demand for block-space falling to levels last seen in 2020. However, whilst low demand for transactions is a generally bearish insight, it also reflects an unwillingness of strong hands to spend at these prices. Are they waiting for a relief rally?
Simultaneously, a seismic shift is underway in the Chinese mining markets as multiple regions enforce bans on the industry. This week we will explore the observable on-chain impact of both changes in hash-power, and in miner spending behaviour.
Tumbleweeds On-chain
It is very quite on-chain.
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced dramatic slow-downs in on-chain activity with active addresses and total transfer volume falling back to 2020 and early 2021 levels. Bitcoin active addresses have fallen by 24% from the generally sustained peak of 1.16M from March to early May. The current activity of 884k addresses was last seen this time last year.
For Ethereum, the fall in active addresses has been even larger, dropping 30% from the brief peak of around 676k addresses. Activity is now down to 474k addresses/day, last seen in Q1 2021.
BTC vs ETH Active Addresses Live Chart
When it comes to USD value settled on the networks, the decline in activity is even more dramatic. Both Bitcoin (change-adjusted) and Ethereum (ETH transfers) are settling -63% and -68% less USD value respectively, compared to the recent highs set in May.
Bitcoin is settling around $18.3B per day, whilst Ethereum is settling $5B/day in ETH transfers, both demonstrating equivalent volume to Q1 2021.
BTC vs ETH Transfer Volume Live Chart
Naturally, the priority fees for inclusion in the next block have fallen significantly as network congestion almost completely clears. Bitcoin total fees paid have fallen to just under 30BTC/day (~$1.2M), coincident with levels in late 2019 and early 2020. This currently represents around 4% of miner revenue with the block-subsidy making up the remaining 96%.
Bitcoin Total Transaction Fees (BTC) Live Chart
For Ethereum, daily fee revenue has fallen from over 15k ETH/day in early May to just 1.9k ($4.34M). This represents around 10% of total miner revenue being sourced from transaction fees. We have to look as far back as June 2020, before 'DeFi Summer', to find similar levels of transaction fees paid.
ETH Total Transaction Fees (ETH) Live Chart
Supply and Spending Behaviour
From a macro perspective, there are remarkable similarities to the 2017 macro peak in regards to the balance of supply held by Long (blue) and Short (red) Term Holders. The chart below shows the relative supply held by each cohort and whether they are in profit (dark colours) or loss (light colours).
After reaching 'Peak HODL' (maximum LTH supply), both cycles demonstrated a macro distribution event, as BTC wealth is transferred from Long term to Short term holders. After the top was put in, we have started to see the opposite effect, where Long-term holders stop spending and begin re-accumulating, despite their coins often falling into an unrealised loss.
Since the $64k top, Long-term holders own an additional 5.25% of the circulating supply of which 1.5% of this is currently underwater (held at an unrealised loss). Despite prices approaching the cost basis for many long-term holders, they continue to HODL on.
Relative LTH vs STH Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart
If we investigate aggregate spending behaviour over the last year, we see the proportion of young coins (those < 1yr old, excl. < 1day) on the move has continued to increase as a proportion of transaction flow. In the last few months, we see younger coins accounting for over 45% of the total transaction count. This is most likely a result of newer market entrants:
Buying the euphoric top and then,
Selling in capitulation and amidst the current choppy conditions.
What this metric does show that most of the current on-chain activity is due to buyers from the last 6-months spending their coins and realising losses.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
Conversely, older coins (those > 1yr old) have reduced their spending, with a notable decline after the May sell-off. This demonstrates the two sided reality of empty mempools:
1) Demand for on-chain settlement is extremely low (generally bearish)
2) However, this also indicates that long-term investors are not bailing out at these prices (neutral to bullish)
The
Spent Output Age bands
are a particularly useful tool to have on hand should the market experience a strong rally or further capitulation. A primary behaviour to watch out for is in an event where these older coins come roaring back to life, such as on a relief rally. If so, it may indicate that old hand investors are exiting into liquidity or panic selling (bearish). If not, and their coins stay dormant during volatility, it would be a strong indication that conviction to hold remains in play (bullish).
We explore this and many other cyclical metrics to identify bullish/bearish trends in our article on Bitcoins On-chain Cycles.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
To confirm just how insignificant the spending behaviour of all coins is, we can look to the Binary CDD metric with a 7-day moving average applied. This metric will trend higher when the volume of coin-days destroyed is larger than the long term average. More coin-days are destroyed when older coins and/or large BTC size are moved on-chain.
Binary CDD has fallen so low that only 1 in every 7-days is experiencing lifespan destruction above the long term average. This state has persisted for almost all of June and commenced relatively quickly after the May sell-off indicating old hands are reluctant to sell at these prices. It also highlights how little demand for block-space there is.
The entire market appears to be waiting for the next move, and few are willing to make the first one. Whichever direction this breaks, the directional response of these lifespan metrics will provide valuable insight into the market bias. They will indicate whether old hands in particular are spending their illiquid coins and taking whatever exit liquidity is there, or if they are
holding on like Rick Astley

Weekly Feature: Seismic Mining Shift
One of the largest migrations of Bitcoin hash-power in history appears to be underway. Following an official ban on mining activities in a number of Chinese provinces, many miners are in the process of shutting down or migrating their hash-power outside of China's borders.
Some mining farms went down in Sichuan overnight. Quick reactions
- the mining ban appears just as comprehensive as believed
- even hydro powered provinces aren‚Äôt being spared
- hashrate transition is real and the nature of bitcoin hashrate will entirely change in next 6-12 mo
‚Äî nicol√°s carretero (@nic__carter)
June 19, 2021
Over the past two weeks, the estimated mean hash-rate (7DMA) has declined by around 16%, falling from approximately 155 EH/s to around 125 EH/s. Hash-power has now returned to levels that were sustained throughout mid 2020.
Mean Hash-rate Live Chart
As the Chinese mining industry comes to grips with the logistical challenges of relocating, migrating or selling their hardware and facilities, some are likely to liquidate a portion of their accumulated BTC treasuries. These coin sales may represent miners hedging risk, obtaining capital to facilitate and fund logistics, and for some miners, may be a general exit from the industry entirely.
The Miner net position change metric shows the 30-day rate of change of miner unspent supply. This shows a notable increase in distribution over the last two weeks, generally coincident with the decline in overall hash-rate. Miners have on net distributed at a rate of around 4k to 5k per month over the last two weeks. This has reversed the trend of net accumulation which was active since April.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
Finally, we take a look at the holdings on OTC desks which are utilised by miners for matching their large size distribution, with large volume buyers.
During both the May Sell-off and over the last two weeks, between 3.0k and 3.5k BTC in net inflows have been observed. However in both instances, almost the full inflow size was absorbed by buyers over just a few weeks. On aggregate, the total BTC holdings on OTC desks we monitor have remained relatively flat since April.

2021,26,2021-W26,2021-06-28,2021-07-04,Bearish,34493.22,35284.05,34677.83,2.29,Disagree,"The Bitcoin market is working hard to hold the lows of the present trading range established since the sell-off in mid-May. The market traded down to a new local low of $28,993 early in the week before recovering to set an intra-day high of $35,487.
As mining hash-power continues to drop off the network during the largest migration of mining hardware in history, Bitcoin holders market wide appear to have capitulated at the lows once again. The market realised the largest absolute losses in history and we explore the cross section of the market most affected.
This week we also assess the overall demand dynamics related to institutions such as Grayscale's GBTC, various ETF products and the coin balance on Coinbase.
Capitulation Round 2
After breaking new records on absolute dollar denominated losses in May, the market capitulated yet again this week, realising a new ATH of $3.45B in losses. Losses are realised on-chain when a coin that was last moved (UTXO created) at higher prices is spent again at lower prices (UTXO destroyed), assuming it was sold for a loss. Note that as the Bitcoin market increases in valuation, larger absolute dollar values of profit and loss are possible.
What this means is that a very large volume of coins that were underwater were spent this week. Note that almost all Long-Term Holders are in profit and their spending actually offset around $383M in net losses (total realised loss was $3.833B!). ¬†Currently only 2.44% of the circulating supply is held by LTHs at an unrealised loss.
Net Realised Profit/Loss Live chart
On a more relative basis, we can look to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) to observe how this second capitulation compares on a relative basis. We look at SOPR metrics for two cohorts, Long- and Short-term holders. These two metrics have the same calculation, but need slightly different interpretations:
Long-Term Holder SOPR (left, orange)
may be thought of as the profit multiple realised as LTHs are generally well in the green. A LTH-SOPR value of 1.95 means on aggregate, long-term holders realised profits of 195% (an average cost basis around $16.3k at current prices).
Short-Term Holder SOPR (right, blue) g
enerally oscillates around a value of 1.0 as a result of coins recently moved being re-spent during market volatility. Falling to values well below 1.0 (and sustaining it) indicates significant losses are realised by this cohort.
This weeks downside price action appears to have created a panic in both LTHs and STHs as demonstrated by the volatility in LTH-SOPR, and deep capitulation in STH-SOPR. STHs have realised losses only slightly less than in the March 2020 capitulation event. LTHs were willing to spend coins with an average cost basis fluctuating between $9.2k and $16.3k this week, suggesting a high degree of uncertainty.
However, despite some evidence LTHs who spent coins were panic selling, almost all 'lifespan' based metrics that track coin age continue to break down towards pre-bull levels. One way we can interpret the above pieces of information are:
Some LTHs spent their coins
during market volatility, likely in a panic based on the spread of cost basis.
Most LTHs did not spend their coins
and thus the average age of coins that were on the move remains very young (despite the market realising $3.45B in net losses).
Sell pressure is largely STHs
who are almost entirely holding coins at an unrealised loss. 23.5% of all circulating supply are owned by STHs and underwater, compared with 3.4% that are in profit.
ASOL, Dormancy and CDD from the HODLers Dashboard
Miner Sell Pressure
As the largest migration in Bitcoin hash-power in history takes place, the market has been speculating as to the magnitude of miner sell pressure that may be creating headwinds for prices. There are two primary factors that may be driving an increase in miner sell pressure:
Dramatic decline in revenue to the recent ~50% mark-down in prices leading to more coin sold to cover the same fiat denominated costs.
Logistical expenses and risk incurred by miners to relocate or liquidate mining equipment necessitating liquidation of BTC held in their treasuries. These expenses are likely to be ongoing for some months.
To start our analysis, we can assess the change in aggregate miner revenue (7DMA). This demonstrates that the mining market has experienced an approximately 65.5% decline in revenues since levels sustained in March and April. The 7-day average mining revenue currently sits at around $20.73M/day, which in context, is still 154% higher than it was at the time of the back-to-back halvings in 2020.
Mining Revenue Live Chart
Over this same period, mining difficulty has only increased by only 23.6%. The mismatch between revenue and difficulty is primarily a result of the global shortage in semi-conductors that has limited the ability of miners to expand their operations. In practice, this mean that mining Bitcoin has been exceptionally profitable throughout 2021, and that some mining hardware that would otherwise be obsolete, remains profitable. This means fewer coins need to be sold to cover costs and miner treasury reserves can be built up.
The Bitcoin mining puzzle is 23.6% harder despite revenues being up 154% on a 7-day average basis. Since a very large proportion of hash-power is currently offline and in transit, and the next difficulty adjustment is estimated to be -25%. As such, miners who remain operational are likely to become even more profitable over the coming weeks, unless price corrects further or migrating hash-power comes back online.
Mining Difficulty Live Chart
This largely indicates that miners who are in operation are unlikely to exert excessive compulsory selling (Point 1) and thus it is more probable that Chinese miners liquidating treasuries is the dominant sell-side source (Point 2).
Thus, the second question is whether miners are liquidating their treasuries to cover the incurred risks and costs to relocate hash-power. Here we take a look at the aggregate balance held in miner wallets and see that in aggregate, miners have added 10k BTC to their treasuries since the low on 27-Jan. This represents 7.6% of all coins mined since then and indicates that miners generally have distributed 92.4% of their coins over this period.
We can also see an overall spend of 7k BTC that occurred in early June which may well be a miner or set of miners liquidating coins in preparation for the migration.
Miner Balance Live Chart
We can also track the rate of miners sending coins to exchanges to assess relative sell pressure. Here we use a 14-day moving average to smooth the data over the same period as the difficulty adjustment window.
Relative to 2020 and Q1 2021, miner sell pressure on exchanges has actually been notably less than the 300 to 500 BTC/day sustained over that period. Current miner inflows to exchanges has steadily declined from over 500 BTC/day in March to under 200 BTC/day in June.
Miner to Exchanges Live Chart
We also review the balance on the OTC desks we monitor, representing another principal destination for miners coins to match with larger buyers. Throughout 2021, there has been a progressive 'step-down' in OTC balances, with each leg down typically correlated with changes in market trend. From April to June, a total OTC balance of between 8k and 6k BTC has been maintained, with a net outflow of ~1,134 BTC over the last two weeks.
Balance on OTC Desks Live Chart
Institutional Demand Remains Slow
A primary driver for Bitcoin price appreciation in 2020 and 2021 was both the narrative, and the reality of institutional demand. One of the largest factors in this was the one-way flow of coins into Grayscale's GBTC trust fund as traders sought to arbitrage the high premium observed in 2020 and early 2021.
Since Feb 2021, the GBTC product has reversed to trade at a persistent discount to NAV, hitting the deepest discount of -21.23% in mid-May. Following the subsequent sell-off, the GBTC discount has started to close up, trading this week between a low of -14.44%, and a high of -4.83% to NAV.
Grayscale's GBTC trust currently holds over 651.5k BTC, a whopping 3.475% of the circulation Bitcoin supply.
Grayscale GBTC Premium Live Chart
There are two Bitcoin ETF products available in Canada which may also provide insight into institutional demand:
The Purpose Bitcoin ETF
The 3iQ Digital Asset Management QBTC ETF
The Purpose ETF has continued to grow in total BTC under management, with net inflows of 3,929 BTC since 15-May. This represents a daily inflow of 95.83 BTC/day (using a 7-day week) and brings the total ETF holdings up to 21,597 BTC.
Purpose ETF Holdings Live Chart
Meanwhile, the QBTC ETF has seen significant net outflows over the last two months. Total holdings have declined in two notable steps by a total of -10,483 BTC. This brings current holdings down to 12,975 BTC.
As such, the Purpose ETF has now flipped the QBTC ETF in total coins under management. Nevertheless, when combining the net flows for both ETFs over the last month, a total of -8,037 BTC have flowed out of these ETF products.
QBTC Holdings Live chart
Finally on the institutional front, we can observe the net change in the coin balance held on Coinbase, a preferred venue for US institutions during the bull market. After a sustained period of net outflows since Dec 2020, the change in Coinbase balance has flattened out markedly.
Between observations of the GBTC premium, net outflows from the combined Purpose and QBTC ETFs, and a stagnant Coinbase balance, institutional demand appears to remain somewhat lacklustre.

2021,27,2021-W27,2021-07-05,2021-07-11,Bearish,33697.78,34259.23,33753.84,1.67,Disagree,"The Bitcoin market has traded slightly higher this week, albeit still within the trading range established since mid-May. Price traded between the weekly high of $36,460 and a low of 32,775, as volatility declines whilst price consolidates.
As volatility seeps out of the Bitcoin price, it has notably ramped up in the mining industry, as the Bitcoin network adjusts to an incredible decline in hash-power during the Great Migration. This week the protocol experienced the largest difficulty adjustment in history, adjusting down 27.94%.
The resilience of the Bitcoin protocol is remarkable. This week, blocks continued to be mined, transactions continued to be settled, all whilst ~50% if its industrial base relocates, and reallocates capital to new jurisdictions. This week we will focus on a number of on-chain mining metrics that help characterise and gauge the magnitude of this incredible shift that is underway.
Sizing Up the Mining Shift
This week we saw plenty of volatility coming into in mining metrics, as the impact of the mining ban in China reaches full swing. When a significant proportion of hash-power comes offline, blocks will be mined at a slower pace until the difficulty adjusts downwards. This realigns the complexity of the mining puzzle to the average hash-power observed over the 2016 block difficulty window (~14-days).
This week, the average block interval on a 24-hr average basis spiked to a short term high of 1,958s (32.6mins), over 226% longer than the 600s target block-time. This event was only temporary on 28-June, with average block-times since recovering to an average between 800s to 900s.
Mean Block Interval Live Chart
If we zoom out, we can see that this was the slowest average block-time since the 2009 cypherpunk era where Bitcoin did not even have a market price. The previous longest average block-time of 1,774.5s occurred at the bottom of the final pull-back before the 2017 blow-off top.
Block Interval Live Chart
To estimate the magnitude of the hash-power shift underway, we can consider the change in estimated hash-rate since the stable peak observed in April to early May 2021. Note that hash-rate is estimated as a derivative of block-time and difficulty, and here we have used a 24-hr moving average to smooth out some of the natural variability.
Hash-rate on the network was typically around 180 EH/s at the peak, and fell off to a local low of 65 EH/s (aligned with the 1,958s average block-time on 28-June).
Hash-rate has since recovered and stabilised around the 88 to 110 EH/s range, reflecting an overall decline of 38% to 49% of hash-power. This provides a gauge on the proportion of the network that is currently offline and affected by the ban in China.
Hash-rate Live Chart
Now that protocol difficulty has adjusted down, we can see the Difficulty Ribbon has inverted to the deepest extent since the 2018 bear market capitulation. A difficulty ribbon inversion is an extremely uncommon event where the faster moving averages of difficulty (9D, 14D etc) fall below the longer term moving average (128D, 200D).
A difficulty ribbon inversion typically represent a miner capitulation event, usually observed at the end of bear markets, or after halving events when miner incomes are squeezed, and profitability takes a hit. It is a result of miners switching off the machines that are costing more than they are making, and has historically correlated with strong bullish market reversals.
Difficulty Ribbon Live Chart
Miner Revenues Get a Boost
Whilst difficulty ribbon inversions are historically bullish events, in this instance, the huge logistical costs incurred by Chinese miners may necessitate spending of accumulated BTC treasuries, creating sell pressure. However, it is important to note that there is somewhat of a counter-balance in the uplift in revenues for the remaining ~50% of operational miners.
When Bitcoin was trading in the $50k to $60k range in April, hash-rate was at its peak, and the aggregate mining industry saw incomes of $50M to $60M per day. Whilst prices have since declined by around 50%, the miners who remain operational have just seen an estimated 38% to 49% of their competition switch off in the short-term.
The daily aggregate revenue now around $25M to $30M per day, but is shared amongst a smaller pool of miners. Same daily BTC issuance, fewer competitors to share the spoils.
This implies that following the latest difficulty adjustment, operational miners are incurring the same OPEX expense, but are seeing profitability rise almost 2x, approaching similar profitability levels to back in April.
Daily Miner Revenue Live Chart
The Miner Outflow Multiple tracks the rate of miner spending relative to their yearly average. From this we can see miners have dramatically slowed their spending of late, even amidst the Great Migration. Historically, we have seen the following cyclical patterns in miner spending behaviour:
HODLing in Bear Markets (green)
where miners reach a stable steady distribution pattern (flat Outflow Multiple).
Increased distribution in Bull Markets (red)
as miners take advantage of bull market strength and sell at an accelerating pace (rising Outflow Multiple).
Declining distribution after Market Tops (blue)
as miners slow down their spending perhaps due to increasing conviction, or a desire to limit excessive the sell-pressure (declining Outflow Multiple).
Impressively, even during the Great Migration, we are yet to see a significant increase to miner spending behaviour. The speed of hash-rate recovery will provide further insight to this as:
A quick hash-rate recovery
indicates Chinese miners have successfully relocated, liquidated hardware, or otherwise recovered costs, reducing the risk of treasury BTC sales.
A slow prolonged hash-rate recovery
indicates the inverse, and increases the odds that costs are being carried, debts are accumulating, and thus creating a higher probability for miner BTC sales.
Miner Outflow Multiple Live Chart
In fact since early 2020, the macro spending behaviour of miners has changed dramatically. For almost all of Bitcoins trading history, miners have consistently spent more coins than they accumulated such that unspent supply was in a structural downtrend.
This means that miners historically spent more coins than they accumulated.
The chart below shows the unspent miner supply (i.e. coinbase transactions that have never moved) plotted against its 365-day moving average. From mid 2020, the structural downtrend in miner distribution, appears to have not only flattened out, but reversed. The unspent BTC in coinbase outputs is now above its yearly average.
This suggests that miners have begun accumulating in a way the market has not seen to date. Given the timing of this event, there are likely a number of factors to consider behind this:
The macro monetary landscape
supporting the case for Bitcoin became globally apparent in 2020, increasing miner conviction.
Miners have access to vastly
superior financing options
such as coin collateralised debt, and liquid options and futures markets to hedge risk.
Reduced ASIC miner production
due to constraints on global chip fabrication capacity. As price rises, existing hash-power becomes increasingly profitable as little new competition can come to market.
As prices rallied in the bull market, BTC mining is likely to have been (and still be) particularly lucrative through this halving epoch.
Miner Unspent Supply Live Chart
Scarcer than Gold
Many analysts have pointed out this week that the Puell Multiple, an indicator for miner profitability, also dropped into the 'undervalued zone'. The Puell Multiple is calculated by taking the ratio between daily aggregate USD miner revenue, and its 365-day moving average.
High Puell Multiples
indicate strong profitability and thus high incentives for miners to sell thus increasing liquid coin supply on the market.
Low Puell Multiples
indicate poor profitability, miner capitulation and the gaining in share of hash-power by stronger miners, eventually leading to a supply squeeze.
Like the Difficulty Ribbon inversion, this is a rare event, having happened only five times in history, usually during generational market capitulation events.
Note: The Puell Multiple has a revised Glassnode Academy Entry with detailed explaination of both the metric, but also the mining market mechanics it describes.
Puell Multiple Live Chart
However, as is the case for many metrics, who doesn't love a little bit of nuance?
The principle reason the Puell Multiple dropped like a stone, (and then promptly reversed) is actually a technical one:
Block-times slowed down by 226% on 28-June.
This means only 58 of the target 144 blocks were mined that day (40%).
As a result, only 40% of the expected BTC was issued that day making aggregate miner revenues fall by 60%.
The difficulty adjustment has since corrected this.
In fact the issuance rate of Bitcoin fell to an all time low of 0.71%, making for a stock-to-flow ratio of 140. Bitcoin was technically 2.37x scarcer than gold (
S2F of 59
)...if just for one day...

2021,28,2021-W28,2021-07-12,2021-07-18,Bullish,33091.10,31788.25,32174.36,-3.94,Disagree,"It has been an impressively quiet week in the Bitcoin market as volatility continues to seep out, and prices squeeze into a tight consolidation range. The week opened at a high of $35,128, and traded down to a low of $32,227. It is starting to feel like the calm before the storm as muted and quiet activity appears across both spot, derivative, and on-chain metrics.
This week we will explore a broad range of metrics and indicators across the entire Bitcoin market to establish overall sentiment, volatility triggers, and models for investor behaviour.
Early Signs of Miner Recovery
A key theme of the previous two editions of this newsletter have focused on the changing conditions across the Bitcoin mining market (see Weeks
26
and
27
). A key takeaway in establishing a bullish or bearish bias is the speed at which hash-rate recovers.
Rapid hash-rate recovery
may suggest offline miners have successfully relocated or re-established their hardware, recovering costs and likely reducing the risk of treasury liquidation sell-pressure.
Slow hash-rate recovery
may suggest the converse, where costs and outage continues to take a financial toll, and thus increases the risk of treasury sales.
This week, the hash-rate has recovered from the peak-trough decline of 55%, to around a 39% decline. Should this level hold and be representative, it would indicate that hash-power equivalent to around ~29% of the affected hash-power has come back online. This could be due to:
Miners in China that have successfully relocated hardware,
Previously obsolete hardware has been dusted off and found a new lease on life.
Mean Hash-rate Live Chart
We previously noted
that miners who remained operational at this time would experience a dramatic boost in profitability, minimising the compulsory sell-pressure. To support this thesis, the Miner Net Position Change metric has returned to accumulation. This indicates that what sell-side pressure is coming from offline miners, is more than offset by accumulation by the operational miners.
A major downside change to this metric would suggest financial stress is affecting the mining market and likely foreshadow an increase in liquid supply.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
Depletion of Exchange Reserves
A key theme throughout 2020 and Q1 2021 was relentless depletion of exchange coin reserves, with many of them en route to the Grayscale GBTC Trust, or accumulated by institutions. This showed up as a persistent net outflow from exchanges.
Throughout May, this trend dramatically reversed as a flood of BTC was deposited to exchanges, alongside the market selling off by ~50%. On a 14-day moving average basis, the last two weeks in particular have seen a more positive return to exchange outflows, at a rate of ~2k BTC per day.
Exchange Net Flow Live Chart
As volatility squeezes out of the market, it is common for mempools to clear and demand for block-space to decline. As such, the transactions that are executed tend to represent a less speculative and more 'purposeful' sample compared to a frothy bull market.
This week, the proportion of on-chain transaction fees associated with exchange deposits declined to 14% dominance after a brief peak to around 17%. Continuation of this as a structural trend may reinforce a thesis sell-side pressure is subsiding.
Exchange Fee Dominance Live Chart
Conversely, the proportion of on-chain fees associated with withdrawals saw a notable bounce from 3.7% up to 5.4%, a 43% boost in relative dominance. This too suggests a rising preference for accumulation over sales.
Note that deposit fee dominance will generally be larger than withdrawals in magnitude, generally as a result of exchanges deploying batching techniques for efficiency, including many customer withdrawals under a single transaction and fee.
Exchange Fee Dominance Live Chart
Last on exchanges, the aggregate balance has fallen by around 40k BTC over the past three weeks. This represents approximately 28% of the total inflow of 140k BTC observed since the local low set in April. Exchange balances we track are currently holding 2.56M coins.
Exchange Balance Live Chart
Derivatives Quieten Off
Across derivative markets, we see relatively quiet conditions as open interest stalls, and trading volumes continue to decline. Given the heavy influence of derivatives markets in the
leverage flush back in May
, this suggests a reduced appetite for leveraged speculation.
Since the sell-off in May, futures open interest has remained bound between $10.7B and $13.0B with only a handful of notable builds or declines within that range. Open interest remains 57% below the ATH set in April as Coinbase went public.
Futures Open Interest Live Chart
Volumes across futures markets are also in decline, falling back to $45B traded per day. These volume levels were last seen in Q1 2021 where prices were trading in a similar range ($29k to $38k). This puts current volumes 62.5% and 49% lower than the May (#1) and June (#2) capitulations, respectively.
Futures Volume Live Chart
Options markets are experiencing a similar slow-down, with open interest falling by over 67% since typical highs of $13.2B in March and April. Current options open interest is at $4.4B, returning to December 2020 levels.
With such a significant decline across all derivatives markets, it becomes increasingly likely that market volatility will be driven by spot volumes, rather than short/long squeezes or leveraged liquidations. Thus the direction of the next large move is likely to strongly reflect underlying supply and demand (rather than a speculative premium/discount).
Options Open Interest Live Chart
Supply Dynamics
Now that we have covered miners, exchange flows, and derivatives markets, we finally turn to dynamics of existing holders of the coin supply. Here we are looking for the balance of spending and holding patterns to assess investor sentiment and conviction.
The ASOL metric captures the average age of spent outputs in a daily basis. Being that ASOL considers only the average age of spent outputs (not coin volumes), it is largely unaffected by quiet mempools. The chart below also uses entity adjustment to filter out exchanges and similar economic entities who often use low on-chain fee environments for wallet consolidation and management.
Similar to the 2017 and 2019 peaks, the average age of spent outputs is rapidly collapsing, indicative of a return to higher conviction HODLing and likely accumulation (noting it takes time for a subsequent accumulation supply squeeze to manifest).
EA-ASOL Live Chart
ASOL suggests that overall, older coins are increasingly dormant. The HODL waves provide more data-points to support this thesis.
The chart below filtered for coins aged between 2y and 5y. These age bands reflect two groups of strong conviction buyers, both of which held through significant volatility:
2y-3y Holders accumulated in the bear market from late 2018 through to the 2019 peak. These investors currently hold 9.8% of the supply.
Since March 2020, 5.2% of the circulating supply has 'matured' from the 2y-3y band into the 3y-5y band.
3y-5y Holders accumulated between July 2016 and July 2018, and thus represent last cycles bull market buyers. This cohort continues to grow, now representing 13.1% of the supply. These investors bought between $640 and the previous ATH at $20k and have held through significant volatility.
HODL Waves Live Chart
For middle aged coins (6m to 2y old), we can see that through Q1 of this year, these investors were largely distributing (declining waves). The accumulation range for those Q1 sellers extends as far back as January 2019 after the 2018 capitulation to $3k (thus capturing a tidy profit multiple).
These cohorts appear to have recently commenced a switch in behaviour, from spending, into a holding pattern. Coins aged 1y-2y currently represent 13.3% of the supply and were accumulated from mid-2019 to mid-2020. After a distributing heavily in Q1, their holdings plateaued, indicating a slow down of spending.
Coins aged 6m-12m are this cycles bull market buyers and now hold 9% of the coin supply. This age band has started to notably swell starting in early April, indicating that a large proportion of buyers from Nov-Dec 2020 have not spent their coins.
The evolution of these 'middle aged' HODL waves over the next three months will be key to appreciating how much of the 'early institutional supply' remains tightly held, or conversely, was sold over recently.
HODL Waves Live Chart
Finally, we investigate the youngest economically meaningful coins, those aged between 1m and 6m. These represent bull market buyers who were generally buying coins off older hands realising profits. This behaviour is evident from Nov 2020 to May 2021 as young coin supply swelled from ~22% to over 32%.
However, since the sell-off in May, the young coin supply has commenced a structural downtrend which indicates coins are maturing, HODLing is taking place, and accumulation is likely underway.
It is favourable for price if young coin supply continues to decline (old coins dormant and young coins maturing). Conversely, large spikes in young coin supply suggests renewed distribution and would favour a a bearish bias.

2021,29,2021-W29,2021-07-19,2021-07-25,Bullish,30842.03,35428.26,32631.38,14.87,Agree,"The Bitcoin market continues its low volatility consolidation this week, with prices trading between a high of $34,564 and a low of $31,125. As the market tests the lows of a significant on-chain support zone, transaction activity remains depressed and HODLing behaviour shows remarkable resilience.
We have an extremely divided market, and one with a likely expansion of volatility just around the corner. As such, in this weeks edition, we explore both the Bull and Bear cases using a combination of market and on-chain metrics.
Setting the stage
To start our analysis, we will begin with the UTXO Realised Price Distribution metric, which presents an on-chain volume profile across pricing buckets. Zones where significant clusters of volume arise, can indicate that a large number of coins changed hands at those prices, and thus represents a concentration of cost basis.
Between $31.0k and $34.3k, coin volume equivalent to 10.5% of the circulating supply (1.973M BTC) have transacted, outsizing the previous high volume node established in the $50k-$60k range. However, the market is trading at the lower end of this support node and there are few comparatively few on-chain support levels below until $18.8k.
URPD Live Chart
The Bearish Case for Bitcoin
We will start our bearish case by considering institutional demand flows which continue to be a necessary source of capital inflows to reach and sustain higher valuations. In the limelight this week will be the performance of the Grayscale GBTC product with around 31.9k GBTC shares unlocking through the remainder of July.
The GBTC market price continued to trade at a notable discount last week, ranging between -11.0% and down to -15.3%. Whilst the discount has recovered from the absolute lows of -21.3% to NAV, any significant and persistent discount suggests lacklustre demand, and can also attract capital away from spot BTC markets.
GBTC Premium Live Chart
The Purpose ETF has also seen a slow-down in net inflows this week, after a period of relatively strong demand through May and June. The week closed with the largest net outflow of -90.76 BTC since mid-May. Similar to the GBTC product, this indicates institutional demand remains relatively weak across these regulated products.
Purpose ETF Flows Live Chart
Last on the institutional demand side, OTC desk holdings have seen a net inflow of around 1,780 BTC over the last two weeks, moving against the structural trend of outflows in place since November 2020. It remains to be seen whether this net inflow is just a short-term impact, or the early signs of a reversal in the balance of supply and demand.
OTC Desk Holdings Live Chart
On-chain activity remains extremely muted this week with mempools clearing, and transaction volumes continuing to fall. As the mempool empties, the average block size has fallen by 15% to 20%, down to 1.103M bytes.
This indicates that demand for Bitcoin block-space and on-chain settlement is low, mined blocks are not full, and the utilisation of the network is relatively low.
Mean Block Size Live Chart
Entity-adjusted on-chain volume (14-day EMA basis) remains down 65.8% from the highs in April. The Bitcoin network is currently settling $5.3B/day compared to the $15.5B in daily volume settled at the 2021 peak. This demonstrates relatively low demand for value settlement remains in place.
EA Transfer Volume Live Chart
Of the transaction volume that is being settled, a dominant majority appear to be coins realising losses. If we compare the total value of realised losses and profits, we see losses (pink) have consistently been larger than profits (green) since the sell-off in May.
Median losses this week were around $353M per day, more than 2.2x greater than the $158M/day in realised profits. Whilst these volumes are much lower than the two capitulation events ($1.60B and $744M respectively), this demonstrates that investors holding underwater positions continue to spend and sell their coins.
Realised Loss/Profit Comparison Chart
We can also assess how much of the coin supply remains underwater to gauge how much supply may become additional sell-side pressure.
The chart below shows that approximately 6.2M BTC, equivalent to 33% of the circulating supply is currently holding an unrealized loss.
Supply at a Loss live Chart
Finally, to close out our bearish case, we can see that the number of new on-chain entities is still down 28.6% from the highs set in February 2021. The decline is not yet as severe as it was after the 2017 blow-off top, however it remains to be seen if this metric stabilises, or declines further.
Summary of Bear Case
Market is trading at the low end of a high on-chain volume cluster
with very little cost basis support between $31.0k and $18.8k.
GBTC discount persists, declining Purpose ETF inflows and OTC desk inflows suggest
lacklustre institutional demand
.
On-chain activity (volume and entities) remains significantly down
from the highs. Utilisation of the Bitcoin network for value transfer suggests low demand.
Losses continue to be realised on-chain
and a total of 6.2M are currently held at an unrealised loss. These coins may well form overhead resistance and sell-pressure.
The Bull Case for Bitcoin
After painting a relatively bleak picture with respect to immediate demand and network utilisation, there remain positive signs across many on-chain metrics, particularly longer range indicators and supply metrics.
To start, lets return to the idea of
on-chain entities
, a topic which has been the source of
some confusion of late
. We define:
An Entity
as a unique on-chain cluster of associated addresses. If a cluster of addresses interact and demonstrate heuristics to suggest a single owner, they will be classified as a single entity.
The chart below presents three metrics telling a holistic picture for on-chain entities:
Sending Entities (green)
are often associated with UTXO destruction. Most wallets enforce single-use addresses when spending, which typically reduces the entity count. At present, we see fewer spending entities indicating less spending of UTXOs and a preference for HODLing.
Receiving Entities (pink)
are the converse, associated with UTXO creation, new owners, and new accumulation. June and July have seen strong growth in receiving entities.
Net Entities Growth (blue)
takes the difference between 'destroyed' and 'created' entities. Given 'destroyed entities' is declining and 'created entities' are increasing, we have a positive aggregate Net Growth.
To summarise: more HODLing and less spending; likely reflecting an environment similar to dollar cost average style accumulation.

To support this observation, we can see that the exchange net position change has reverted back to a net outflow after a significant period of net inflows. Exchanges are currently seeing a rate of net outflows of around 36.3k BTC per month.
Exchange Net Position Change Live Chart
Miners are also demonstrating extreme resilience and desire to accumulate, despite the extraordinary costs incurred as the Great Migration carries on. It is possible that additional sell-side pressure from offline distressed miners is being more than offset by the extraordinary profitability by remaining operational miners.
Miner Net Position Change Live Chart
If we observe the volume of supply held by 'strong hands', we can see that HODLing appears to be the preferred strategy. Long-Term Holders currently hold 75% of the circulating supply (6% at a loss, 69% in profit).
The bullish squeeze that started past bull markets has historically been triggered by LTHs holding 65% (2x 2013), 75% (2017), and 80% (2020) of the circulating supply.
If the current rate of coin maturation (14.75k BTC/day) persists, LTHs would hold 80% of the coin supply in around 2-months (although this is not likely to play quite so cleanly, since we know many coins from Mar-May were spent and sold).
Relative LTH Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart
The Illiquid Supply Change metric supports this observation following a dramatic reversal from distribution in May, to HODLing and accumulation in June-July.
Note, positive values (green) of this metric are a result of widespread coin dormancy (more illiquid coins) with limited spending. Conversely, negative values occur when illiquid coins are spent back into liquid circulation.
Finally, to round out the Bullish case for Bitcoin, we turn to the Realised Cap HODL waves which shows unmistakable indicators of HODLing, coin maturation, and further evidence to the probability of an potential supply squeeze in the works. There are two primary observations:
Structural, multi-month declines in younger coin bands
(red-orange)
which can only occur when young coins make up a smaller proportion of 'realised value'. This occurs when young coins mature and age to become older coins, which creates;
Swelling of older coin bands (yellow, 3m-12m)
as the volume of coins held at these stronger hand, LTH classified age brackets grows. A decline in these bands without corresponding growth of the next oldest band would start to invalidate this thesis.
Realised Cap HODL waves Live Chart
Summary of Bull Case
Net Entity growth
remains positive as fewer entities are destroyed, and more are created. This resembles a 'dollar cost average' style accumulation environment.
Exchanges have seen net outflows
after an extended period of inflows since mid-May.
Miners are in net accumulation
suggesting sell pressure due to the Great migration is being mitigated or offset by accumulation by profitable miners.
Long-term holders
and bull market HODLers appear unshaken by volatility and lower prices. The volume of coins held in illiquid state continues to grow, and the potential supply squeeze is coming from a much higher base than the 2018-19 bear. This demonstrates the remarkable conviction of BTC holders to weather extreme volatility.

2021,30,2021-W30,2021-07-26,2021-08-01,Bearish,37262.77,39865.41,40058.02,6.98,Disagree,"The Bitcoin market has experienced a strong break-out out this week, trading from the consolidation lows of $29,479, to a high of $35,423 on Sunday. Whilst technically an event for next weeks newsletter, at the time of writing, Bitcoin's price was ralling off the back of what appears to be a short squeeze, reaching a high of $38,677 early Monday morning.
This week we will review both the derivatives and on-chain market data to assess the lead into this short squeeze, and establish a basis for the profitability of the market. As investors return to profitability, it asks the question as to whether or not they will begin spending those coins into market strength if conviction to hold remains, or has it waned.
Shorts Squeezed Higher
With the growth and maturing of derivative markets, the interplay between spot and leveraged markets creates new dynamics in this market cycle that were not present in the past.
As we opened the week, open interest in the options markets suggested that volatility was expected. Open interest by strike price one month out (27-August contracts) shows a notable preference for strikes well outside the current consolidation range. The strike prices with the most open interest for 27-Aug on Deribit are:
$25k for Puts
with 1,388 BTC in open interest.
$80k for Calls
with 1,513 BTC in open interest.
Options OI August Live Chart
Open interest in perpetual futures markets has remained largely flat over the past two months, ranging between around $10B and $12B since May. Over the last week however, perpetual futures open interest climbed by a notable $1.4B alongside the rally in price. Often-times, elevated open interest starts to increase probabilities of a volatile leverage squeeze occurring.
Open Interest Live Chart
If we assess the volume derived from cash-margined collateral, we can see a structural uptrend has been in play since early May. Cash-margined collateral are those futures positions that leverage cash, or cash equivalent (stablecoin) based collateral. In general, cash-margined positions are preferable for market stability as they remove a layer of risk that is present when volatile crypto-margined futures dominate.
Cash-Margined Futures Live Chart
Confirming this trend, we can see the relative dominance of crypto-margined futures positions has been in structural decline over the same period, falling from 70% down to 52.5%. Whilst leverage in all forms is known to exacerbate market volatility, these two charts show a clear decline in traders taking on risk-on crypto-margined positions which is a net positive trend for the market. It also adds weight to the risk-off nature of the current market structure.
Percent Crypto-Margined Futures Live Chart
To assess the directional bias of futures markets, we can see that perpetual funding rates have continued to trade negative. This indicates the net bias remains short Bitcoin. This metric in particular helps us identify that Monday's price rally is likely associated with an overall short squeeze, with funding rates continuing to trade at even more negative levels despite price rallying +30%.
Futures Funding Rate Live Chart
Indeed, during Monday's rally, almost $120M in shorts were liquidated in an hour, which largely confirms that a short squeeze as a primary driving force.
Shorts Liquidation Live Chart
On-chain Activity Remains Quiet
In direct contrast to the volatility in spot and derivatives markets, the transaction volume and on-chain activity remains extremely quiet. On a 14-day Median basis, the entity-adjusted transaction volume for Bitcoin remains depressed at around $5B per day. This remains a significant decline from the $16B/day prior to the May Sell-off.
However, volume has not yet collapsed to the same extent as the 2017 blow-off top, where network volume saw a full retrace, a subsequent bear market and eventually, a lengthy capitulation. It remains to be seen whether on-chain volumes start to pick up in response to recent volatile price-action.
EA On-chain Volume Live Chart
Despite on-chain transaction volumes falling, when compared to the network valuation (market cap) in the NVT Ratio, we can see an interesting fractal. Historically, very low values of NVT suggest the network is undervalued relative to the amount of transaction volume. Conversely, higher values, as seen back in Feb 2021 indicate transaction volumes are relatively low and may not justify the current market valuation.
As prices traded down to the lows of $29k at the start of the week, the EA-NVT suggested that the Bitcoin network was relatively oversold compared to on-chain settlement volumes. This short squeeze has now pushed the EA-NVT higher. If on-chain volumes do not rise in support of these elevated prices, it may suggest the rally lacks fundamental drivers and would be a sign for caution.
Note: both the on-chain volume and the NVT charts are shown as entity-adjusted. This filters for only economically meaningful transactions by removing self-spends, wallet management and other internal transfers.
Entity Adjusted NVT Ratio Live Chart
On the topic of entities, we can see a more constructive spike in receiving entities (those taking custody of coins) whilst sending entities (those spending coins) remains relatively flat. This is an early trend change and one that would indicate a more positive accumulation type environment if it persists. It highlights that of the volume that is transacting, a reasonable portion looks to be accumulation, and relatively little is entities exiting the network.
Sending vs Receiving Entities Live Chart
Overall, on-chain activity remains somewhat bearish and continues to be quiet. Perhaps utilisation of the Bitcoin network is lagging prices in this case. Ideally, renewed volatility and constructive price action sparks back demand for block-space. If not, it may suggest a more cautious framework is necessary in the weeks ahead.
Network Profitability
To close out our analysis for the week, we will assess the aggregate market profitability relative to the Realised Price. The Realised Price is one of the principle metrics underlying on-chain analysis. It is calculated by valuing all coins at the price when they were last moved, and thus represents the aggregate 'cost basis' for the circulating coin supply.
The Realised Price is currently trading at $19.3k, generally coincident with last cycles ATH. With this weeks closing price of $35.4k, it means the aggregate market currently holds an unrealised profit of around 83%.
Realised Price Live Chart
In the context of past market cycles, we can use the MVRV ratio to compare the market cap (spot valuation) to the realised cap (on-chain cost basis). Here we can see that the MVRV ratio is trading in a zone that is historically reached in three circumstances:
Early-Bull cycle (3x)
where prices have macro bottomed and smart money accumulators have returned to an appreciable profit level.
Mid-Bear cycle (2x)
where investors have seen their unrealised profits dramatically slashed following a cycle top, but before the ultimate capitulation.
Double Pump (1x)
in the 2013 market where the mid-cycle shake-out put enough investors off-side, before swiftly reverting into a powerful blow-off top.
At this stage, it remains to be seen whether the market can turn the macro trend around and confirm a resumption of the bull market. If so, it would resemble the 2013 'double pump' market. If not, the probability of being a mid-Bear fractal may increase.
MVRV Live Chart
Looking at the MVRV for the short-term holder (STH) cohort, we can see that they are currently holding coins at a significant unrealised loss. The STH-MVRV rarely trades at such oversold conditions with almost all historical instances being followed by significant price rallies. That said, these fractals typically only occur in Bear Markets, noting that this includes the final capitulation event which starts a macro bull.
STH-MVRV Live Chart
We can also investigate the volume of supply that has returned to profitability during the short squeeze. This provides us with an estimate of coin volume that has an on-chain cost basis in the $29k to $38k consolidation range. From the weekly low ($29k) to the short squeeze high ($38.4k at the time of writing) over 2.1M BTC has returned to profitability. This represents a volume equivalent to 11.2% of the circulating supply.
Supply in Profit Live Chart
Finally, we review whether there are any signs of older profitable coins being spent on-chain to take advantage of market strength for exit liquidity. What would be relatively bearish is to see a significant increase in older coins (>1yr) spending during this relief rally as was seen in 2018 after the blow-off top.
So far, we have not seen such behaviour. If general dormancy of older coins persists, it would suggest conviction to HODL remains relatively strong and favour a more constructive view on market structure moving forwards. Conversely, the spending of older coins en mass would indicate a flush of illiquid coins are returning to liquid supply and a more bearish outlook ahead.

2021,31,2021-W31,2021-08-02,2021-08-08,Bearish,39149.59,43829.14,41326.89,11.95,Disagree,"The Bitcoin market has rallied strongly this week, adding to the gains of the short squeeze started on Monday morning. The market opened at the weekly lows of $35,326 and reached an intra-day high of $42,388. This provided some welcomed positive price action after months of consolidation, and multiple retests of the $29k floor.
In this edition, we assess how the market has reacted to this first set of strong green candles for some time. We analyse the magnitude of profit taking, and how accumulation and spending behaviour is manifesting on-chain.
Disbelief or Bear Relief Rally?
After an extended period of very negative sentiment, and sustained downwards price action, Bitcoin has traded high with gusto this week. A key question is whether this is a Disbelief Rally (where everyone doubts the new bull trend), or simply a Bearish Relief Rally in a larger time-frame downtrend.
To start our assessment, we look to the realised profit and loss on-chain. We can see that after a long period of elevated losses being realised in May to July (pink), over $2B in profits were realised on-chain this week (7-day median). This suggests there is some portion of the market who spent their profitable coins, potentially taking exit liquidity.
Realised PnL Live Chart
The aSOPR metric provides a view of realised profit/loss by the aggregate market, ignoring coins younger than 1hr. We can see that on net, the majority of on-chain spending have realised losses since the sell-off in May. Each time price rallied, traders spent their coins, making an aSOPR value of 1.0 act as resistance.
This week aSOPR has rallied significantly higher as profits were realised on-chain. Key observations to keep an eye on from here are:
aSOPR resets to 1 and then bounces higher
: This indicates the market has stopped realising profits (holding conviction remains) and absorbed the sell pressure (
Disbelief
).
aSOPR falls back below 1 and stays there
: This indicates the market is again realising losses and was unable to absorb the sell-side pressure (
Bearish Relief)
.
aSOPR Live Chart
We have established that some volume of profitable coins were spent on-chain. We can look to assess which cohorts of holders these coins may have been sourced from. If we assess old coins (>1y) in the Spent Output Age Bands, we can see that there have been four distinct phases of this market cycle:
Bull Market Distribution
in late 2020 to Q1 2021 as older coins were spent at an accelerating rate.
Top Formation
with slowing distribution from Feb to May 2021.
Capitulation and Risk-off
in May and June as the market reacted to the unprecedented FUD, and a 50% sell-off to $29k.
Disbelief or Bearish relief
through late-July as the market traded down to $29k and then strongly up to $42k this week.
In an ideal bullish scenario, older coins will remain fairly dormant, spending will remain low or decline, and conviction to hold stays strong. If older coins do start spending, but prices continue to rally, this would indicate a bullish
disbelief rally
may be in play, and the market is absorbing the spent supply.
Conversely, sharp upticks in older coin spending, especially alongside weakening prices, might start to lean closer to a
resumption of the bearish trend
. It would suggest the market is struggling to absorb the spent supply.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
The Realised Cap HODL waves, filtered for young coins (<1 week) provides us with the other side of this equation. Typical behaviour of a bull market is older coins are spent to take profits, new investors buy them, and the 'young coin supply' increases. Eventually, the market cannot absorb more supply and rolls over into a bear market. As speculators leave and smart money accumulate, the population of young coins decline as more move into cold storage.
Eventually, young coin supply collapses after a capitulation event, and massive accumulation takes hold. Very often, as the market rallies out of this capitulation bottom, or starts a bull market, with a series of
Disbelief/Relief rallies (purple)
. Older coins are spent into the rally to take exit liquidity, increasing the young coin supply again.
This week, we have seen a notable spike in these younger coins out of what resembles a capitulation bottom. In a bullish scenario, this would subside (HODLing dominates) and/or price continues higher in spite of it (disbelief, absorbing the sell-side). In a more bearish scenario, this starts an uptrend of 'new young coin supply' suggesting weakened conviction to hold the asset by old hands, and increasing liquid supply.
Realised Cap HODL waves Live Chart
Lastly on the spending front, we revisit miners who fall into two groups:
Offline Miners
impacted by the migration out of China and incurring large costs.
Online Miners
who are operating at high profitability due to around half the competition being offline.
The net transfer volume from miners to exchanges bottomed out at less than 100 BTC/day in mid to late July. This week however, we have seen an increase to around 300 BTC/day, which is a 3x increase from the July lows. Keep in mind that this is still in line with typical behaviour throughout 2020 and 2021. It does reflect the resilience of the Bitcoin mining market whereby half of the miners may add to sell-pressure out of necessity, whilst the other half can accumulate at twice the rate.
Miner to exchanges Live Chart
Exchange Supply Falls
So far we have looked at spending behaviour in response to positive price action. Now we will build up a thesis around the flow of supply out of exchanges, and into on-chain wallets.
The exchange net position change metric maps out the monthly rate of coins flowing in (green) or out (red) of all exchanges. This week we have seen an extremely large volume of coins flow out of exchanges, comparable to the peak outflows seen in November 2020. The rate hit over 100k BTC per month in outflows this week.
Exchange Net Position Change Live Chart
In terms of the aggregate balance still held on exchanges, holdings have now returned to the 2021 lows of 13.2% of circulating supply. This represents a near full retracement of the significant inflow volume observed during the May sell-off.
Exchange Balance Live Chart
Another interesting dynamic this week is the interplay between coins held on Coinbase and Binance, the two largest exchanges by balance. Coinbase saw significant outflows throughout most of 2021, whilst Binance was the largest recipient.
The trend for Binance appears to have stalled and started to reverse, with a total outflow of approximately 37.5k BTC this week. Coinbase balances plateaued in June, saw a large deposit of around 30k BTC in mid-July, and this week an outflow of 31k BTC. This has largely unwound all inflows since mid-May. Overall, this may well be the start of another era of net exchange outflows and is a trend to watch.
Exchange Balances Live Chart
Macro Sentiment
To provide a macro overview of supply dynamics on-chain, we can consult the Liveliness metric in both standard and entity-adjusted forms. Liveliness has the following properties:
Uptrends
when more coin-days are destroyed than created (old coin spending)
Downtrends
when accumulation and dormancy dominate (HODLing)
Entity Adjustment
corrects for internal, self spends or non-economic transactions
We can see in the chart below that the market has returned to macro accumulation almost immediately after the May sell-off. Recently the standard liveliness metric jumped significantly higher, suggesting that a potentially large volume of old coins were spent. However, the entity adjusted version does not see the same event, which indicates these coins are classified as 'internal' and likely to be reshuffling of an exchange cold wallet.
As such, it seems that HODLing and accumulation is the most likely dominant trend in the on-chain market.
Liveliness Live Chart
The Realised Cap HODL waves tell a similar story with a distinctive uptrend in coin maturation for coins older than 3-months. This has similar hallmarks to accumulation after a blow-off top, although 2021 is coming from a higher HODLed base (~25%) than 2018 (~15%). Progressive peaks of these bands would provide an indication of the volume of coins that are maturing (higher peaks are more bullish, and vice-versa).
Keep in mind that whilst accumulation and coin maturation is bullish, as was seen in the 2018-20 market, a full scale bullish impulse can take some time to develop.
Realised Cap HODL waves
We can also look to the holdings of on-chain entities, defined as clusters of addresses with the same owner. One of the most aggressive accumulators since May are the Shrimp to Crab cohorts holding < 10 BTC. These small holders now own an all time high of 13.8% of the total coin supply with the trend of accumulation clearly accelerating from May onwards. Of particular note are the 1 to 10 BTC cohort (bottom light green) which distributed since Jan and have returned to accumulation.
Entity Supply Distribution
As a final closing note, there continues to be historically low activity on-chain. The current entity adjusted transaction count remains down 38% from the peak set in February, currently clocking 200k transactions daily. Whilst on-chain activity can often follow positive price action, current levels are equivalent to the 2018-19 capitulation bottom.
EA Transaction Count Live Chart
That said, transaction volumes are spiking higher, up 94% from the lows of $4.7B/day, to around $9.1B/day this week. This suggests a that demand for on-chain block-space is likely dominated by fewer, but larger size transactions at present and is an interesting combination of indicators worth keeping an eye on.

2021,32,2021-W32,2021-08-09,2021-08-15,Bullish,46285.48,47014.49,46259.22,1.58,Agree,"The Bitcoin market has seen another strong week, with prices rallying from lows of $37,524 up to a local high of $45,215. The market briefly traded above the 200-day moving average ($45k) over the weekend, before retracing and commencing consolidation. As a well observed technical indicator for bull/bear bias, the markets response to a rejection or breach of the 200-day MA is likely to be a source of attention over the coming weeks.
As price action confirms underlying market strength, we assess the on-chain response to the rally, seeking to identify whether Bitcoin holders are taking exit liquidity, accumulating, or HODLing on. We will also assess the early stages of Ethereum supply dynamics following the successful release of the EIP1559 fee burn mechanism.
On-chain Spending Behaviour
We start our analysis with the
Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric
, which is a relatively short range indicator, presenting a view over the profit and loss realised by coins spent on-chain. Here we have used the
Workbench
tool to overlay two versions of SOPR:
aSOPR
representing the whole market, but excluding coins younger than 1hr (non-economical relay transactions)
STH-SOPR
representing only the profit/loss of Short-Term Holders.
After many months trading below a value of 1.0 (net realised losses), both SOPR metrics have executed what looks like a textbook bullish reversal. This is described as follows:
A: SOPR breaks above 1.0
after a sustained period of losses being realised on-chain. This signals profits are realised, and the market was able to absorb that supply.
B: SOPR reaches a local high
profitable coins take advantage of market strength to spend and realise profits. This creates a local top via over-supply, and price corrects.
C: SOPR resets back to 1.0
signalling profitable coins have stopped being spent and conviction returns to the market and the dip is bought. SOPR then trades higher repeating the rally higher.
Most important to watch is whether SOPR holds above 1.0. Should SOPR continue to trade higher, this reflects a bullish scenario where the market is adequately absorbing profits realised on spent coins. If on the other hand, SOPR falls and trades back below 1.0 on a sustained basis, it would suggest a general weakness in the market and potentially a fake-out rally.
SOPR analysis Live Workbench Chart
The Spent Output Age Bands demonstrate that on the whole, middle age (3m-12m) and old coins (> 1y) remain relatively dormant, and are not exiting the market seen in 2018. The majority of spending in this cohort are younger and aged between 3m-6m, representing bull market buyers. These transactors may be exiting or de-risking closer to their cost basis.
Overall, this metric remains fairly bullish in that urgent exit selling by old hands does not seem to be occurring.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
ASOL is a lifespan metric that generally confirms this observation. ASOL reflects the average age of spent outputs on a per transaction basis (no influence from coin volume spent).
ASOL traded higher throughout Q1 and Q2 as old coins were distributed, eventually putting the top in. The bearish shock in May caused this metric to collapse lower, indicating that owners of older UTXOs were largely unwilling to sell at those prices (and did not panic sell).
ASOL hasn't returned to the 2020 lows (~20-days), however appears to be trading sideways again. A strong uptrend in ASOL from here would be bearish as it indicates old coins are spent back into liquid circulation. Conversely, ASOL trading sideways to down (as it currently is) would suggest conviction, accumulation and HODLing prevails.
EA-ASOL Live Chart
On a 14-day median basis, Average Coin Dormancy has returned to around 10-days, the same level as the period of accumulation throughout 2019 and 2020. This lifespan metric presents the average lifespan of spent coins on a
per BTC spent
basis. It provides further evidence that old hands are not taking exit liquidity at this stage.
This is likely constructive for prices ahead.
Dormancy Live Chart
Large Transactions Dominate
If we investigate the dominance of transactions by size, we can see a clear trend in play. The chart below shows dominance by on-chain transaction volume for values exceeding $1M+ (~23 BTC+ at $43.5k). Since September 2020, the dominance of these large size transactions has risen from 30%, to 70% of the total value transferred.
As the market traded down to the lows of $29k in late July, the $1M to $10M transaction group spiked markedly, increasing dominance by 20%. This week, the dominance of $10M+ volume followed through with a spike of 20% dominance supporting the price rally.
Given the lifespan analysis above suggests older coins have been largely dormant of late, this suggests that these large size transactions are more likely to be accumulators than sellers and is again, fairly constructive for price.
Relative Transfer Volume Dominance Live Chart
The other side of this equation, the chart below demonstrates a structural decline in small size transaction dominance. Transactions of less than $1M in size have declined from 70% to around 30%-40% dominance. These two charts clearly demonstrate a new era of institutional and high net worth capital is flowing through the Bitcoin network since 2020.
Relative Transfer Volume Dominance Live Chart
Supply Squeeze Assessment
A popular talking point of late has been the potential for a Bitcoin supply squeeze.
Indeed, we have seen an extraordinary recovery of Long-Term Holder (LTH) owned coins, with total supply held approaching 12.48M BTC. This is extremely similar to the volume of coins held by LTHs in October 2020 before the primary bullish impulse started.
This on-chain response is largely indicative of the volume of coins that were accumulated in Q1 2021 that remain tightly held. It too paints a quite bullish picture for aggregate market conviction.
Although do note, increases in LTH supply is a characteristic of bear market accumulation; and bull markets are the result of a supply squeeze, forged in bear markets.
LTH-STH Supply Dynamics Workbench Live Chart
In the chart above, we have also shown the circulating and adjusted supply metrics. Adjusted supply accounts for coins that are either likely lost, or ancient and deemed extremely illiquid and unlikely to freely circulate.
We have used
Workbench
to take the ratio between LTH, or STH held supply, and the Adjusted Supply to see the proportion of 'freely circulating' coins owned by each cohort. By this metric:
LTH Owned Supply
has just reached a new
All-Time-High of 82.68%
. Note also the persistent uptrend in coins held by these long term investors over time.
STH Owned Supply
continues to decline suggesting HODLing and coin maturation is in play.
Major Supply Squeezes
have historically occurred when the
STH Supply Ratio hits 20%
(often holding that level for some time), representing a significant constraint on freely circulating supply.
The STH Supply Ratio is currently at 25% suggesting that a further maturation of only 5% of adjusted supply would put the market firmly back into historical supply squeeze conditions.
LTH-STH Supply Dynamics Workbench Live Chart
To assess how likely the remaining 5% of adjusted supply is to be accumulated and maturing, we can inspect the HODL waves.
Relatively young coins aged between 1w and 3m represent a large portion of the liquid supply. We can see that after the uptrend in Q1 (old coin distribution), these age brackets have fallen back to bear market equilibrium level of around 12.5% to 15% of supply. This downtrend indicates that coin maturation is indeed in play, and that many of the 2021 bull market buyers have stuck around to become strong hand HODLers.
HODL Waves Live Chart
This is largely confirmed by observing the middle to old coin age bands (3m to 2y) which show a remarkable increase in supply from 35.7% to 47.5% of the circulating supply (not adjusted supply). Coins aged 3m to 12m (Bull market buyers) are leading the charge on HODLing behaviour, displaying an undeniable trend of coin maturation.

Of particular note is the 3m to 6m age band, which currently holds 13.35% of the coin supply, and includes the approximate threshold between STH and LTH (155-days). Approximately 6.5% of the entire coin supply reached 3-month maturity on the 15-April, and it appears that these coins are still held.
Whilst the supply squeeze based on the STH Supply Ratio is not yet at 20%, there are numerous indicators and trends in play that suggest it may hit it in mid September (but that the conditions for a supply squeeze are already in play).

Weekly Feature: The EIP-1559 Burn
The Ethereum network has recently rolled out the London upgrade which includes the new fee stability mechanism EIP1559. As part of the implementation details is a burn mechanism for the BASE FEE portion of the transaction fee, denominated in ETH.
Since the launch of the London upgrade (block height 12,965,000) until the time of writing (block height 12,986,848), a total of 43.6k ETH has been issued via PoW mining. In that same time, a total of 15.25k ETH has been burned representing a 35% reduction in total net issuance.
Taking as look at the volume of ETH burned per block, we can see that so far fee pressure has pushed the burning mechanism above the design 2 ETH issuance in a handful of instances creating net deflationary blocks. So far, EIP1559 has a mean burn rate of 0.697 ETH per block.

The market has shown remarkable strength since the local bottom of $29.7k set in July, suggesting strong fundamental spot demand underlies the rally.
This week, we analyse the on-chain metrics related to the mining market, capital inflows, coin accumulation, and net unrealised profit and loss. Through a complete assessment of the on-chain market structure, we can establish whether the probabilities favour the current market strength as a prelude to a bear, or whether a bull market disbelief rally is in full swing.
Miner Revenues Increase
As the Bitcoin mining Great Migration continues, and miners transition out of China, we have started to see a recovery in hash-rate from the lows set in July. Hash-rate peaked out at around 180 EH/s in May before falling by 50%. This provides insight into the magnitude of affected miners as being roughly half the network.
Over the course of the last two months, hash-rate has increased by around 25% from the lows, suggesting hash-rate equivalent to around 12.5% of the affected miners have come back online. The network is currently mining at a rate of 112.5 EH/s.
Bitcoin Hashrate Live Chart
In response, the Hash-Ribbons, which attempt to model where stress enters the mining market, have commenced another positive cross-over. The Hash-Ribbons are formed by taking the 30D and 60D moving average of hash-rate with the following signals:
30D Crossing Below 60D
is generally a signal of
income stress
entering the mining market as hash-rate comes offline rapidly. This can create additional sell pressure as miners are generating less income to cover their CAPEX and OPEX costs.
30D Crossing Above 60D
is generally a sign of
hash-rate recovery
and miner capitulation. After this, the remaining miners have grown their share of the market and thus earn more BTC per hash.
Hash Ribbons Live Chart
We can confirm this is the case using the Workbench Tool, and taking the ratio between total miner revenue (in BTC), and the active hash-rate. This presents the average BTC earned per hash of mining power.
Since the halving in May 2020, aggregate miner income has declined from around 9.5 BTC/EH to a low of 5.6 BTC/EH in May. As protocol difficulty adjusted in response to the Great Migration, miners who remained online have now seen their BTC income grow by 57% per hash to around 8.8 BTC/EH.
Miner Revenue per hash Live Chart
As a result of this, we have seen the net balance position of miners continue to increase over the last two months. The net growth of miner balances has now hit +5k BTC/month which demonstrates a net reduction in compulsory sell-side pressure sourced from miners.
Miner Net position Change Live Chart
Absorbing Capital Inflows
One of the most important on-chain metrics for Bitcoin is the Realised Cap, which is the on-chain equivalent to the market cap. It is calculated by valuing each coin at the price when it was last spent, representing an aggregate cost basis for the market. The Realised cap can be considered as follows:
Uptrends
indicate that coins accumulated at cheaper prices, are being spent, likely sold, and the market must absorb that sell-side pressure to trend higher.
Downtrends
indicate that coins accumulated at higher prices are being sold for a net realised loss and is typical of bearish markets.
The Realised Cap started trending higher in late-July and has just reached a new all-time-high of $379B. Given spot prices have continued to rally, this indicates that new capital is flowing into Bitcoin, and the market is capable of absorbing that sell-side pressure.
Realised Cap Live Chart
The net realised Profit and Loss metric demonstrates that since the recent local low of around $29k, the market has realised profits of between $0.5B and $1.5B per day. This follows and extended period of net realised losses through May to July that represented a likely capitulation event.
Market demand is currently absorbing coins sold at realised profits of a similar magnitude to the period in Nov-Dec 2020, prior to the main bull run. If the market can continue to sustain capital inflows at this level, it sets up a strong base and justification for continued market strength.
Net Realised PnL Live Chart
If we take a look at the average value of transactions flowing in and out of exchanges, we get a gauge of the net buy and sell-side action. Prior to the sell-off in May, both inflows and outflows converged around an average transaction value of ~$35k. This level was largely representative of the average exchange flows in Q1 and Q2 2021.
Following the May sell-off, both inflows and outflows dropped to $14k and $20k, respectively. These smaller average transaction sizes generally suggest an influx of smaller traders were both shaken out, and stepping in to buy the dip.
Since the recent $29k low, average outflow value has risen back to $35k which is a substantially higher divergence from than the average inflow value of $24k. Overall, this suggests larger size buyers are accumulating and smaller size traders are on the distribution side.
Exchange Average Flows live Chart
This aligns well with the Exchange net position change metric which demonstrates a net outflow has persisted since the start of July. Net outflows from exchange balances is currently occurring at a rate of between 50k and 100k BTC per month. This compares to the approximately 140k BTC in net exchange inflows through May-June we highlighted in our
Week 31 edition of the newsletter
.
Exchange Net Position Change Live Chart
Holders Return to Profit
As prices rally, a larger portion of the coin supply returns to profit. This provides us with an opportunity to assess both how many coins were accumulated in particular price ranges, and also assess the aggregate market incentive to sell and realise gains.
Since the low of $29.7k set in July and the current price of $47.0k, a total of 19.2% of the circulating coin supply has returned to profit. This means that around 3.6M BTC were last spent, and thus have an on-chain cost basis in this price range.
From this we can deduce that a very significant volume of BTC has been accumulated in this price range. Note also how much larger this jump in profitable supply change is when compared to January where prices were in the same $30k-$40k range. This indicates that on net, approximately 1.4M additional BTC have been revalued within this price range since then.
Percent Supply in Profit Live Chart
The Net Unrealised Profit/Loss metric provides a cyclical oscillator mapping the magnitude of unrealised gains/losses as a ratio of total market cap value. The NUPL metric has just broken above 0.5 indicating that the total coin supply is currently holding unrealised profits equivalent to 50% of the market cap.
Historically, a NUPL value of 0.5 is reached following a deep correction in two instances:
Bear Market Relief Rallies
as was the case in 2014, 2018 and at the end of the mini-bull in 2019. Coin holders take exit liquidity, their profitable sell coins and prices roll over.
Bull Market Disbelief Rallies
at which point a modest correction usually follows a NUPL value of 0.5 before the bull run continues. Similar spending behaviour governs as in bearish relief rallies, with investors taking profits into strength. The difference is that the market carries on upwards afterwards, creating additional FOMO buy pressure.
NUPL Live Chart
Finally, the STH-NUPL, which filters only for short-term Holders has returned to profitability. This means that coins moved within the last ~5 months are on net, slightly above their aggregate cost basis. Similar to the standard NUPL metric, these events are uncommon, but tend to precede explosive moves into a bear, or a bull market.
With the body of evidence we have outlined above ¬†across miner recovery, strong exchange ouflows, and relatively large accumulation below, the scales have most likely now tipped in favour of the current market conditions being a bull market disbelief rally.

Confidence, conviction and positive sentiment has followed this uplift in prices, as Bitcoin climbs closer to reclaiming its Trillion dollar valuation. The key level to break is $53k for Bitcoin to return to the 12-zero's club.
This week has seen some minor profit realisation on-chain by long term holders, although so far it does not appear to be of significant coin volume to put the brakes on. In this edition of the newsletter, we will assess both the state of on-chain activity as well as characterise the current spending behaviour of investors.
Open Interest Escalates
In derivatives markets, open interest for both Futures and Options has climbed alongside price to reach new local highs. After the precipitous fall from the $27.4B ATH during the May sell-off, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen by $6B (+56%) from the lows of the recent consolidation. This week in particular, saw an increase of $1B in futures contracts opened as traders begin to take on more leverage.
Futures Open Interest Live Chart
In terms of directional bias for traders, the perpetual futures funding rate has a moderate lean to the long side. Funding rates have traded positive since late July as futures markets trade above spot prices. However, the magnitude of funding is nowhere near the peaks seen in the Q1-Q2 bullish trend. This may indicate that excessive leverage is not in play just yet, and perhaps the uptrend remains reasonably spot driven and healthy.
Bitcoin Funding Rate Live Chart
Options markets have also seen multi-month highs in open interest, rising by over $4.1B (+105%) since the lows set in June. The current level of $8.0B in open contracts is similar to levels seen during the May sell-off, and in Jan-Feb 2021. Note that prices were lower, trading around $30k to $40k, in both of these previous instances.
This too suggests that relative to the total market size, the degree of open interest in derivatives markets is relatively low compared to the degree of leverage seen in the first half of the year.

Exchange Balances Plateau
This week we have seen signals on-chain that some investors, particularly those with older UTXOs, have been spending coins. This week saw a very slight uptick in BTC held on exchanges which follows a month long plateau in coin balances.
After the significant net inflow of around 140k BTC to exchanges in May, July saw around 110k BTC in net outflows, largely reversing that trend. However throughout August, exchange balances have stalled at around 2.5M BTC (~13% of circulating supply).
Exchange Balance Live Chart
The Exchange Net Flow metric shows that this week saw overall net inflows to exchanges as some traders and investors appear to be taking profits, and capitalising on market strength. It is worth noting that the magnitude of inflow is not dissimilar to that seen through the Dec 2020 to April 2021 bull market period and is reasonably expected behaviour.
Exchange Net Flow Live Chart
The chart below combines the Realised Profit and Realised Loss metrics using the
Workbench
tool. From this we can see that overall, investors holding profitable coins are currently spending more value on-chain than those with coins that are underwater.
The decline in realised losses of late could indicate that investors have found renewed conviction to hold on, or are potentially taking exits that are closer to their original cost basis, as price recovers towards the $50k range.
Realised Profit and Loss Live Chart
Who Is Spending On-chain?
If we investigate the Spent Output Age Bands metric, we can start to dissect which cohorts of the market are spending coins. This week has seen a noticeable uptick in older coin ages, particularly those older than ¬†6-months. In the last year, these older coins have come back to life on a similar scale in two instances:
Distribution in a Bull Market
as old coin holders take profits into market strength.
Distribution in Major Sell-offs
as old coin holders de-risk during the recent major correction.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
We can see a similar view looking at spent outputs aged between 6m and 5y which largely captures experienced Bitcoin investors and traders who have weathered non-trivial volatility in this cycle already. We can see a sharp uptick in all age bands this week which further suggests that some coins are taking exit liquidity.
Spent Output Components Live Chart
This perspective has also been highlighted by analyst
@TXMCtrades
who has utilised the Workbench tool to observe the combined proportion of all spent outputs aged between 6m and 5y. TXMC highlights that the current spending behaviour, where 5% to 7% of spent outputs are in this age range, have historically correlated with high volatility periods.
It is also suggested that relative to previous cycles, owners of older coins tend to be more active traders in more recent years. In the 2011 and 2013 cycles, older coins typically only came back to life around macro tops and bottoms, where as today it is more common around mid-cycle corrections and rallies. This demonstrates a degree of market maturity and financialisation of Bitcoin over time as more active traders and funds enter the space.
3/8 By applying a bit of color, we can highlight areas on the price chart where older coins made up a higher % of daily volume. This helps bring to life the selling behavior of long-term holders.
A few observations stand out...

August 23, 2021
The spending of older coins has also shown up as a trend in the ASOL metric which measures the average age of all spent outputs that day. This trend of rising average age has been in play since July and throughout this rally which suggests two things:
Profits are being realised by old hands
, confirming what has been observed in the charts above.
The market is absorbing the sell-side so far
as prices have continued to climb. This indicates there is sufficient demand to absorb the coins being distributed.
EA-ASOL Live Chart
The Realised Cap HODL waves provide a last piece of evidence surrounding the current on-chain spending behaviour, as the young coin bands (< 1 month old) have swelled throughout August. This indicates that older coins have been spent and revalued into younger coin age brackets.
Note however, that the magnitude of increase for these age bands is very much in line with that seen in the 2020 accumulation phase. What this suggests is that whilst old UTXOs have definitely been spent in August, the actual coin volume they distributed is likely not overly significant. This supports the relatively minor exchange balance increase shown in the chart and section above.
Realised Cap HODL Waves Live Chart
On-chain Activity Remains Divergent
In what continues to be an amazing divergence, on-chain activity has still not responded to positive price action. Entity Adjusted transaction counts remain at historically low levels of between 175k and 200k transactions per day.
These low levels have been seen in a few instances in the past 5-yrs:
The 2016-17 Bull Market
during the disbelief rally and in deep mid-bull pullbacks.
The 2018-19 Bear Market
as interest in Bitcoin waned and prices corrected 85% from the high.
The current period
following the 50% correction in May and 2.5 months of consolidation.
EA-Transaction Counts Live Chart
Transaction volumes are similarly depressed, with the Bitcoin network setting around $18.8B in daily volume. This is 37% lower than at the 2017 bubble peak, and a whopping 57.6% below the peak set during the May capitulation event. That said, settlement volume remains 276% higher than the $5B that was typical throughout 2020, although we should account for fact that price has traded up from $10k to the current level approaching $50k (+500%).
Transaction Volume Live Chart
However, despite this significant divergence between rising prices and low on-chain activity, the overall supply dynamics remain extraordinarily macro bullish. This week, the supply held by Long-term holders has reached an all-time-high or 12.69M BTC, surpassing the previous peak from October 2020.
Through the Q1-Q2 bull market, LTHs distributed approximately 1.75M BTC which ultimately created oversupply, and put in the current ATH price top. Following that, investors dramatically slowed down their spending, and the coins that were accumulated in late 2020 and early 2021 have consistently matured across the ~155-day threshold for classification as 'Long-Term Holders'.
The recovery of LTH supply to ATH has taken just 100-days which goes to show just how significant the accumulation was in the early phase of this bull market. The fact this trend has yet to slow down also demonstrates that significantly more coin volume is getting older, than younger. This adds further weight to the argument that the old hand spending observed this week is likely of low coin volume, and strategic de-risking, rather than a loss of conviction and a mass exit.

Prices traded between a weekly low of $46,465 and a new local high of $50,461.
As the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market rallies higher, a remarkable on-chain divergence continues to form across both Bitcoin and Ethereum. On-chain activity on both chains has remained quiet relative to bull market highs, even as price momentum continues upwards, and bullish trends in supply dynamics remain in play. This week, we explore and compare a number of on-chain metrics between Bitcoin and Ethereum to characterise this divergence.
Setting the Stage
Before starting our comparative analysis, we will take a quick look at the big picture position of the Bitcoin market following a very month of strong price performance. With prices pushing above $50k, and some notable profit taking covered last week, the market currently sits at the top end of a very high on-chain volume node.
The chart below shows the price bands where the current BTC coin supply was last transacted. Since breaching last cycles $20k ATH, three distinct on-chain volume bands have formed:
$31k to $40k (Price Floor)
where over 2.98M BTC were accumulated, both in Jan 2021, and in the recent 2.5 month long consolidation. This is likely now a very strong underlying support zone.
$45k to $50k (Current Range)
where 1.65M BTC have a cost basis. With price at the top end of this range, it is likely that this too could act as strong price support.
$53.7k to $59k (Trillion Dollar Asset)
where 1.336M BTC were accumulated between March and May and are still holding unrealised losses. These coins are those that remain unshaken by a 50%+ correction in May, but could also become overhead resistance if investors seek to exit at their cost basis.
On net, this indicates that a fairly strong set of high conviction investors remain in the market and is a powerful signal for the bulls.
BTC URPD Live Chart
Within this context, profits have continued to be realised throughout August as prices continued to trade higher. This suggests an underlying market strength, capable of absorbing this spent coin supply. The aSOPR metric shows that similar behaviour was observed after the March 2020 sell-off with the following sequence of events:
Capitulation
where losses were realised by panic sellers for an extended period of time.
Profitability Returns
as signalled by aSOPR trading and holding above 1.0. This suggests profits are realised but market strength is sufficient to absorb sell pressure.
Buyer Conviction Returns
as aSOPR resets to 1.0 on a number of occasions, and then bounces higher, suggesting holders of profitable coins prefer to stay dormant, and investors are buying the dip.

On-chain Activity Divergence
Whilst prices rally, an impressive divergence has been maintained in on-chain activity. Demand for blockspace on both Bitcoin and Ethereum remains well below recent peaks despite prices returning to elevated trading ranges.
Active entities on the Bitcoin network is currently around 275k per day, around 35% below the January peak.
Bitcoin Active Entities Live Chart
Active addresses on Ethereum are similarly down 33% from the May peak, currently sitting at around 450k addresses per day. It is notable that current activity on both chains is similar to the stable pre-bull accumulation range established in mid to late 2020.
Ethereum Active Addresses Live Chart
Similar observations can be made regarding transaction counts which provide a proxy for block-space demand. Bitcoin transaction counts are down to around 200k per day, a significant drop of 37.5% below the peak.
Bitcoin Transaction Count Live Chart
Even more dramatic is the USD denominated on-chain transaction volume which is currently down 62.5% to $6B per day relative to the April ATH. Note that the transaction counts above, and volume below, uses our Entity-Adjusted data, which filters out internal transfers and self-spends and thus reflects the magnitude of economically meaningful volume.
Total Transaction Volume by Size Live Chart
As a result of this slim demand for block-space, Bitcoin network transaction fees have declined considerably, returning to levels that have not been seen in the last year. At present, transaction fees average 21 BTC per day, representing only 1 to 2% of the total block reward.
Bitcoin Transaction Fees Live Chart
For Ethereum, transaction counts are also down 33% from the highs, with counts actually declining over the course of this week to around 1100k per day.
Ethereum Transaction Counts Live Chart
Interestingly, within the Ethereum ecosystem, we are seeing a fairly dramatic divergence in on-chain attention. Whilst transaction counts and active addresses are down, the magnitude of fees paid are trading significantly higher. This is most likely attributed, at least in part, to the strong demand for NFT trading and investing.
Total transaction fees on the Ethereum network currently sit around 10k ETH per day which represents a relatively high level, comparable to 'DeFi summer', and the 2021 Bull.
Ethereum Transaction Fees Live Chart
However the heightened market attention for NFTs has come at a cost, with DeFi tokens appearing to be the losers in the equation. The chart below presents on-chain transaction data for four blue chip DeFi tokens AAVE, COMP, UNI and YFI. The top row presents active addresses interacting with the tokens, and the bottom row the USD value transferred in the tokens.
Across the board, it paints a somewhat bleak picture, with all four seeing structural declines in investor attention, most breaking to new lows this week in particular.
DeFi Token Performance Live Dashboard
Bullish Supply Dynamics
The question of whether a divergence in on-chain activity is bullish or bearish is a complex one, as more trading volume for digital assets shifts to off-chain exchanges and derivative instruments. Furthermore, technological advances such as transaction batching, SegWit adoption, and usage of Lightning Network and other Layer 2s make it a dynamic problem to solve.
On the other hand, supply dynamics, particularly looking at coin maturity, provides a fairly robust signal in either direction. Whilst observations of accumulation and HODLing is usually a long range indicator (i.e. takes time to play out), the current market trend is historically strong for the bulls.
The following charts present a series of supply dynamics indicators for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it will become immediately obvious that similarities exist between both chains, and both look very constructive.
Young coins are those younger than 3 months. They are the most likely to be spent during volatility. A decline in the young coin HODL waves indicates the market is preferring to HODL and not to spend. Young BTC now represent only 15%% of the coin supply and a very strong downtrend is in play.
Bitcoin HODL Waves Live Chart
Ethereum HODL waves are almost the same chart, with young coins trending down towards a long term low of 12.5% of the circulating supply.
Ethereum HODL Waves Live Chart
As these young coins mature and age, they transition into Middle Aged (3m to 1y) and old coins (1y+). These mature coins are statistically less likely to be spent, and a climbing proportion of them suggests increasing illiquid supply.
A powerful uptrend in coin maturation is in play for Bitcoin with almost 50% of the coin supply aged between 3m and 3y.
Bitcoin HODL Waves Live Chart
Again, Ethereum supply shows a similar trend with a whopping 70% of the ETH coin supply dormant for at least 3 months. For both assets, these uptrends in older coin supply commenced around March 2021, which therefore reflects a very strong demand to buy and hold throughout this bull market.
Ethereum HODL Waves Live Chart
To highlight this change in market behaviour, and in agreement with a minimal desire for long term investors to spend coins, the Liveliness metric for both chains has entered a very strong downtrend. As a quick refresher on Liveliness:
Liveliness
maps out whether more coin days are accumulated (HODLing) or destroyed (spending) by the total coin supply.
Downtrends suggest accumulation
where more dormancy and coin maturity is building up, and less spending is taking place.
Uptrends suggest spending
where old coins are moved, lifespan is destroyed and distribution takes place.
Steeper trends
mean stronger fundamental trends of the above are in play.
Bitcoin liveliness has reentered a downtrend which has accelerated during this price rally.
Bitcoin Liveliness Live Chart
Ethereum's liveliness metric paints much the same picture, trending strongly down since the May sell-off. Given a huge volume of ETH is transacting at the moment in the NFT movement, it does indicate that much of this volume are the same ETH tokens changing hands.
Ethereum Liveliness Live Chart
Finally, a good signal of adoption, interest, accumulation and HODLing is the growth in non-zero balances. Bitcoin non-zero addresses have continued to grind higher, having returned to over 38M addresses, and about to take out the ATH.
BTC Non-zero Addresses Live Chart
Much like its elder, Ethereum non-zero address counts are also in strong ascent, reaching a new ATH of 60.7M addresses.
ETH Non-zero Addresses Live Chart
Whilst the divergence between price and on-chain activity is historically abnormal for a full scale bull market, it is not an uncommon signature for the pre-bull, and pre-supply-squeeze dynamic. These periods often accompany the end of bear market accumulation where the investors who remain, are the strong hands, those with the highest conviction.
Supply dynamics seem to suggest an extremely robust underlying demand is present, and this should continue to be quite constructive for prices if the trend continues. Aggressive spending of older coins would be a key invalidation signal to watch out for.

As renewed optimism follows positive price action, on-chain transaction volumes are showing continued growth in dominance by large, institutional sized capital. We are also seeing declines in volume spent by long-term investors, A preference to HODL, and the accumulation of young coins. Miners have also started spending coins this week as hash-rate recovers over 42% since the July lows.
Miners Take Profits Off the Table
The Bitcoin mining market continues to recover after half of the hash-power came offline during the Great Migration out of China. The 14-day median hash-rate has recovered to 128 EH/s, which is approximately 29% below the all-time-high, and reflects a 42% recovery from the July lows.
The increase in hash-rate is likely a combination of previously obsolete hardware finding a second lease on life, and miners in China successfully relocating, re-establishing or re-homing their hardware and operations.
Competition in the mining market has continuously increased over time, leading the protocol difficulty to consistently rise. This growth has occurred despite the programmatic decline in new BTC issuance with each halving event. As a result, macro BTC rewards per hash have been in a long-term decline.
Whilst miner incomes are denominated in BTC, their ¬†CAPEX and OPEX costs are largely denominated in fiat currencies. This makes miner effective revenue subject to price volatility.
With such a large portion of the mining hardware offline, and a global production constraints on ASIC chip manufacture, the current mining market is finding itself slow to respond to elevated coin prices since 2020. There are simply fewer machines fighting over the same number of coins, trading at higher coin prices.
As a result, miner USD revenue per hash has now risen back to July 2019 levels of $380k per Exahash, making operational miners exceptionally profitable on a historical basis.
As BTC prices hover around the $50k range over the last few weeks, some of these miners have started spending a portion of their coin balances to lock in profits. This week, around 2,900 BTC have been spent from miner balances, equal to around $145M at a $50k BTC price.
This may be a combination of affected miners in China obtaining fiat liquidity to cover costs, or operational miners taking profits and de-risking after the May sell-off. It is also likely that some of this revenue is earmarked for redeployment into facility expansion, and acquiring hardware from second-hand or new ASIC markets.
Note: the chart below uses our Workbench tool to subtract out the Patoshi coins to reflect the coin balance held by the remainder of the mining market.
Miner Balance (excl. Patoshi Coins) Live Chart
In response, the miner net position change has returned to a neutral level, indicating an on-net equilibrium between miner accumulation, and miner spending over the last 30-days. It is typical for the miner net position change metric to oscillate between around +5k and -5k BTC per month, making the current dynamics reasonably expected behaviour, and the market has clearly absorbed the additional sell-side pressure.

Transaction Size, On The Rise
A key theme and characteristic of the 2020 to 2021 market cycle has been the increase in institutional sized capital. This trend is increasingly visible on-chain, and even after the 50% correction in May, appears to be a relatively sticky.
The average USD transaction size in the 2019-20 bear market was typically between $6k to $8k. This period was largely dominated by retail and early investment fund participants.
The 2020-21 bull market saw average transaction sizes increase significantly into a peak of $58.6k during the May sell-off. This has largely cooled off from July onwards, with the current average transaction size between $30k and $36k.
Relative to the 2019-20 period, this represents a significant 370% increase, despite the recent correction, reflecting continued and sticky institutional sized interest.
EA-Mean Transaction Size Live Chart
Further support for this observation is found the rising proportion of transaction volume dominance by $100k+ sizes. In the chart below, we can see the gradual squeezing of smaller size capital (<$100k) in yellow-red from 40% dominance in 2017, to represent only 10% to 20% of on-chain volumes today.
Conversely, institutional and high-net-worth size capital of $100k+ in green has expanded significantly over the last 12 months. The cohort moving between $1M and $10M (light green) has consistently represented between 20% to 30% of transaction volume since 2017.
The $10M+ cohort (dark green) however have grown considerably, from only 10% in October 2020, to over 30% dominance today. This reflects a notable growth in large size capital allocation and trading activity. Note that this data is entity adjusted, and thus filters for only economically meaningful activity (excludes self-spends and exchange wallet management for example).
Relative Volume By Size Live Chart
Young Coin Volume Dominates
Another observation regarding transaction volumes relates to classification based on coin ages. We have recently released a new metric called the
Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB),
which classifies the proportion of daily coin volume by coin age. It is a counterpart to the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) metric, which ignores coin volume, and only looks at age brackets in proportion to the daily transaction count.
Some general principles for interpretation of these metrics are:
When more old coins (> 6m) are spent
, there is a higher probability that previously illiquid coins are coming back into liquid circulation. This is most common during capitulation events, and in bull markets as coins are sold into strength.
When more young coins (1d to 6m) are spent
, there is a higher probability that smart money investors and long-term holders are holding, and accumulation is taking place, as 'hot coins' are taken off the market.
Hot coins are those with lifespans less than 1-week
. These dominate day-to-day network traffic and are more likely to be re-spent in response to volatility.
From a macro view we can see that hot/young coin volumes spike and dominate on-chain volumes in three typical occasions:
Blow off tops
where trading, speculation and 'hot money' movements reach a maximum.
Capitulation events
where new buyers are shaken out en mass and coins change hands many times during high volatility. Smart money also tend to step in and accumulate.
Disbelief rallies
at the start of bullish trends as traders sell into the first market strength seen in a long time.
SVAB Live Chart
The dominance of hot coin (< 1wk) volume is currently at a relative high of 94% of spent coin volume. Simultaneously, middle and old coin (> 1mth) volume is at an extreme low of less than 2% dominance which is even lower than the bear market base-load seen in 2019-20.
What this suggests is that the vast majority of coins spent at the moment, even as prices breach $50k, are highly liquid coins, and old coins are remarkably dormant. This indicates that conviction to HODL is extremely high and a lack of liquid supply could squeeze spot market prices higher.
SVAB Live Chart
To further confirm this analysis, we can see the volume of revived supply older than 1yr has fallen below 5k BTC per day. This indicates that investors who own coins older than 1yr are spending less, and HODLing more, even as prices rally. Previous events with low revived 1yr+ supply correlate with late stage bear markets and early bull markets.
Revived 1yr+ Supply Live Chart
Leverage Reaches New Heights
The final observation this week relates to the derivatives markets. Alongside positive sentiment and conviction to HODL in spot and on-chain markets, we are seeing open interest approach, or reach, new all-time-highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin perpetual futures markets currently have over $11.8B in open contracts which is trending strongly towards the April peak of $15B.
BTC Perpetual Futures Open Interest Live Chart
The market appears to be net long in perpetual futures markets with funding rates for BTC hitting approaching 0.03%. Whilst this level of positive lean is not overly high relative to levels seen in Q1 and Q2, it is similar to the funding rate seen just prior to the May sell-off. This could create a shorter term headwind if longs are squeezed out of their positions.
BTC Funding Rates Live Chart
This effect is even more pronounced for Ethereum where perpetual futures open interest has surpassed the previous ATH, hitting $7.8B this week.
ETH Perpetual Futures Open Interest Live Chart
Funding rates for ETH futures have similarly accelerated higher, reaching 0.02%, a level coincident with that seen prior to the May sell-off.
Whilst the supply dynamics in spot markets continue to show strength, caution and awareness is appropriate when of high degrees of leverage has entered derivatives markets. The combination of positive funding rates and high open interest can be an important indicator set for assessing a shorter term risk of cascading long liquidations.

What appeared to be the main driver on the sell-side, was a flushing out of excessive leverage in futures markets.
Meanwhile, in spot and on-chain markets, the historically significant trend of investor accumulation and long term holding remains well and truly intact. Despite a 50%+ sell-off experienced in May, a strong rally from the $29k lows, and now another sharp sell-off this week, HODLers appear unphased.
This week, we will explore both the leverage flush that initiated the price mark down, and deep dive into the observable dynamics in the on-chain Bitcoin supply.
Derivatives Lead Downside Volatility
In last weeks
newsletter
and
video report
, we covered how the growth in futures contracts open interest, and increasingly positive perpetual swap funding rates in Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.
This highlighted a growing risk that excess leverage, with a long directional bias, could create a downside price squeeze. On Tuesday, both markets indeed saw a significant sell-off, with Bitcoin trading down more than $10k in one hour. This event acted to clear out much of the accumulated leverage, with the market consolidating for the rest of the week.
From the local high of $13.4B in open perpetual futures interest, a total of $4B worth of contracts (30%) were closed out and cleared within the hour. Leverage has remained fairly steady at around $9.4B for the remainder of the week.
Perpetual Open Interest Live Chart
Using the Long Liquidation Dominance metric, we can see that just prior to this sell-off, futures markets actually experienced a brief short liquidation squeeze, that aided in pushing prices up to the local high of $52.8k. Short liquidations represented 80% of all liquidations during this time.
Immediately following this peak, the opposite occurred, with the proportion of long contract liquidations spiking to 68%, as BTC prices fell over $10k from the highs.
Futures Long Dominance Live Chart
Options markets also saw a spike in volume, as traders rushed to hedge their positions, and capture volatility premium. This has become fairly typical behaviour this year where options markets consistently see elevated activity during market sell-offs.
The total volume traded in options markets has been in recovery mode since a relative lull in activity through May to July. During the hours around Tuesday's sell-off, traded option volumes reached a multi-month high of $1.3B.
Options Volume Live Chart
After a very brief period of negative funding rates during the sell-off, perpetual markets have returned to slightly positive funding rate suggesting that traders are still expecting upside price momentum. Note however that the magnitude of funding is much lower than it was prior to the crash, suggesting that at least a partial deleveraging has occurred.

Coin Dormancy Dominates
Next we will review how spot and on-chain markets reacted to this sell-off. We start by looking at Average Coin Dormancy which presents the average age of the coins spent that day, adjusted per unit of BTC spent with two key takeaway observations:
Dormancy did not spike during the sell-off
which indicates the average age of coins spent at that time were relatively young, and older hands were not shaken out.
Dormancy has continued to fall this week
returning to the lower bound of the 2020 pre-bull period, suggesting the market has a strong preference for longer term holding.
Entity Adjusted Dormancy Live Chart
Revived supply is a metric that presents how much BTC volume was spent that was older than a particular age. We can use this tool to assess whether there is an influx of previously illiquid and HODLed coins coming back into liquid circulation, or if old coins remain dormant. High levels of revived supply could suggesting a negative shift in investor confidence, whereas low values suggest HODLer conviction remains intact.
During this week, 1yr+ revived supply has fallen to remarkably low levels, coincident with that seen in the 2020 pre-bull period. On a 7-day moving median basis, less than 2.5k BTC aged 1yr+ are being spent per day. This is 9x fewer old coins being spent when compared to the 2021 bull market peak in Jan 2021, where over 22.5k BTC were spent as prices reached $42k for the first time.
1yr+ Revived Supply Live Chart
This observation is confirmed by assessing the proportion of supply in the Young HODL waves, those less than 3 months old. Here we can see that coins younger than 3 months have reached an all time low of 15.9% of the circulating supply. The converse of this is that coins older than 3 months now represent an all time high of 84.1% of supply.
Historically, periods where young coins reach a minima tend to correlate with late stage bear markets (blue) after significant smart money accumulation has taken place. This is where hype and interest in the asset is at its lowest, whilst accumulation demand by smart money investors is at a relative high. It describes young coins being taken out of liquid circulation and begin to mature in investor wallets.
The opposite is typically true in late stage bull markets (red) and cycle tops, where the maximum number of old coins are spent and transferred to new investors, attracted by hype, media coverage and price appreciation.
HODL Waves Live Chart
Macro Accumulation Continues
HODLers are often described as
Bitcoins buyers of last resort
, who step in during volatile downswings in price, and place their bids when the markets look the worst. These high conviction buyers are best appreciated on-chain using coin ages, with
our research
suggesting that lifespans of around 155-days is a suitable threshold between Long- and Short-term holders.
155-days ago, in mid-April, the Bitcoin market was trading at $60k, trading up to towards the current all time high. Thus, any coins purchased after the ATH are generally going to be classified as Short-Term Holder coins (STH).
The chart below shows that at this weeks high of $52.8k, over 16.8% of the coin supply was owned by STHs and in profit. What this reflects is the very large accumulation that occurred between the recent low of $29k, and up to the lower bound of the Q2 topping range.
Relative LTH-STH Profit and Loss Live Chart
We can also see that LTH owned supply has reached 79.5% of all BTC coins this week, which is equivalent to the level reached in October, prior to the bull market kicking off. In fact, on an absolute coin volume basis, LTHs currently own the most coins in history, hitting 12.97M BTC this week. Peaks in LTH owned supply typically correlate with late stage bear markets which are historically followed by a supply squeeze and initiation of cyclical bull runs.
LTH Supply Live Chart
It is quite impressive to see the volume of BTC crossing the 155-day STH-to-LTH threshold has maintained a very positive rate since May. One could have reasonably expected it to slow dramatically as many coins that were initially purchased in Q2 2021, in the $50k to $64k range, were sold at a loss in May and June.
However, the charts above, and the Long-Term Holder Net Position change actually demonstrates that a very large portion of the supply accumulated in that topping range, remain unspent, and tightly held to this day.
At the moment, coins are crossing the LTH age threshold at a strong rate of 421k BTC per month. Given we have already established that more than 16.8% of the supply was accumulated in the recent $29k to $40k range, there is a good case to be made this trend will continue into October-December (155-days after the May-July consolidation).
LTH Net Position Change Live Chart
Finally, we review the Liquid and Highly Liquid coin supply (
see our methodology
) on a macro scale which highlights just how unique position the current market cycle is. For the vast majority of bitcoins life, there has been an expansion in the volume of coins that freely circulated and were spent frequently on-chain. After the final capitulation sell-off for the 2018 bear market, liquid supply started to plateau, a trend that persisted until March 2020.
Following the sell-off in March, a structural trend of increasing coin illiquidity has dominated the on-chain supply dynamics, as more coins transitioned out of exchange balances, and into long term investor wallets.
After the moderate exchange inflows in May 2021, this downtrend in liquid coin supply (increasing HODLing behaviour) has resumed, suggesting macro conviction to hold BTC remains a dominant force in the market. It appears that despite significant volatility through 2021, long term Bitcoin investors continue to accumulate and keep coins in cold storage.

2021,38,2021-W38,2021-09-20,2021-09-26,Bullish,43012.97,43178.02,42991.10,0.38,Agree,"The Bitcoin market traded slightly higher this week, opening at a low of $43,789, and trading up to an intra-day high of $48,730. Prices are forming a consolidation trading range after the volatile sell-off that started off the previous week, clearing $4B in excess leverage in one hour.
The Bitcoin market finds itself amidst a macroeconomic landscape punctuated by growing uncertainties in Chinese credit markets, and downside price action for traditional equities over the week. Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin price action, and on-chain investor responses appear relatively robust. This week, we will assess the continued dominance of coin outflows from exchanges, recovering miner hash-rate, and the realisation of modest profits with the market absorbing the sell-side pressure.
Modest Realisation of Profits
In on-chain analysis, we often build models upon the concept of 'realised value' for a coin, that is the price at which a UTXO, containing some volume of BTC, was created. Another way to consider this is the price at which a coin last moved, thus reflecting the on-chain 'cost basis' for that coin.
When a coin is spent at a later time, we can assess the difference between the original realised price, and the current spent price to assess if the owner is realising a profit, or a loss. The aggregate value of all coins spent that day the provides an estimate on the volume of capital flowing into the market, as every seller is by definition matched with a buyer.
Since late July, the market has consistently realised net profits on the order of around $1B per day as prices rallied from $31k to over $52k. This suggests a relatively meaningful bid has supported the market on the way up.
Net Realised PnL Live Chart
We can assess the Spent Output Age Bands to get a gauge on the cohorts of investors who are spending coins in the current market. For coins older than 6-months, there has been a reasonable uptick in spending behaviour throughout the August rally, however that spending has cooled off through September. The proportion of spent outputs older than 6m+ currently sits at around 4% dominance of all spent coins.
Spent Output Age Bands Live Chart
The
Long-term Holder SOPR
provides another view on this spending behaviour, and it has become increasingly volatile since early July. This indicator tracks the aggregate profit multiple realised by spent coins that were older than around 155-days (~5-months).
A LTH-SOPR value of 2.0 means that on aggregate, LTHs realised a 200% gain on their spent coins that day.
We can also flip this observation around to estimate the aggregate cost basis for LTHs who are spending coins by dividing the BTC price by the LTH-SOPR value.
A LTH-SOPR value of 2.0 at a BTC price of $36k gives an aggregate LTH cost basis of $36k/2.0 = $18k cost basis.
The increased volatility in the LTH-SOPR indicator therefore demonstrates that LTHs are spending coins which were accumulated across an increasingly large range of cost bases:
Lower Bound LTH-SOPR = 1.5
suggests coins spent have a cost basis between $24k to $31k
Upper Bound LTH-SOPR = 2.0
suggests coins spent have a cost basis between $18k to $23k
Overall, the range of aggregate cost basis for LTH spent coins since May is therefore between $18k and $31k
. Note these are all prices from within the 2020-21 bull market and suggests that perhaps Bitcoin long-term investors are becoming more active traders, taking profits off the table, or perhaps using coin margined derivatives to hedge risk, or speculate to a greater extent than was seen in Q1 and Q2. It may also reflect some uncertainty regarding current market structure as coins with higher cost basis, closer to the current price, are preferentially spent.
LTH-SOPR Live Chart
To demonstrate this, the chart below shows the estimated LTH spent cost basis (blue, 7-day Median) calculated as Price / LTH-SOPR. We can see that following the sell-off in May, the aggregate cost basis for LTH spent coins rose from the stable baseline of $8k, up to the new range between the $18k and $31k bounds calculated above. This reflects the LTH threshold (155-days) encompassing coins above last cycles $20k ATH, as well as more LTH spending during the volatility since mid-May.
LTH Cost Basis Workbench Chart
Exchange Balances Continue Outflows
Whilst there is spending behaviour observable amongst the existing cohort of Bitcoin holders, it appears there is even more demand for coins accumulated from exchange balances.
Overall exchange balances have continued to decline this week, reaching a new multi-year low of 13.0% of circulating supply this week. This returns exchange balances to levels last seen in Feb 2018. Keep in mind that prices were trading between $6k and $10k at that time. The accumulation of coins after March 2020, with prices trading up from $3.8k to over $64k in April, reflects the significant growth of capital inflows necessary to withdraw this relative coin volume.
Exchange Balance Live Chart
Supporting this observation, is a deeply negative (outflows) exchange net-flow reading this week, with current BTC outflows occurring at a rate of -92k BTC/month. Similar to the exchange balance chart above, the market clearly shifted paradigm after March 2020, from a regime of net exchange inflow dominance, to outflow dominance.
Exchange Net Position Change Live Chart
We can also investigate the comparative performance of various groups of exchanges with similar balance flow characteristics. The first cohort of exchanges includes Bittrex, Bitfinex, Kraken, Gemini and Binance.
These exchanges demonstrate a characteristic inflow and balance growth throughout most of 2020 and 2021, reflecting a rising dominance in coin holdings. Binance and Gemini are the primary recipients of this cohort. Since the sell-off in May, balances across this exchange group have plateaued and seen modest coin outflows.
Exchange Balance Live Chart
The second cohort of exchange balance characteristics are seen across Bitstamp, OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase. For this cohort, outflows have persisted since March 2020 and have actually accelerated in recent weeks.
Overall, the net balance across exchanges has continued to decline as the inflows observed in May are absorbed by the market and moved to investor wallets.
Exchange Balance Live Chart
Bitcoin Miner Recovery and ThermoCap Model
In a continued display of network resilience, Bitcoin hash-rate has climbed again this week, reaching approximately 137 Exahash on a 7-day MA basis. Given the total decline from the all-time-high represented around half the hash-power network, this ~52% recovery means that less than a quarter of the peak network hash remains offline.
Hashrate Live Chart
Throughout 2020 and 2021, miners have demonstrated an increased trend of HODLing a larger proportion of mined coins than in previous market cycles.
After a significant miner distribution that occurred ¬†in Jan-Feb 2021, miners have accumulated 14,000 BTC in unspent coinbase rewards over a 6.5 month period. A moderate spend of around 1,360 BTC occurred in late August, however the uptrend in miner unspent supply appears to be back in play.
Miner Unspent Supply
Lastly we will look at the Thermocap, which is a fundamental valuation model for Bitcoin representing the aggregate security spend to date. It is calculated as the cumulative sum of all block rewards paid to miners, as valued in USD, at the time of block production.
Another way to think about this metric, is that it reflects the cumulative value offered by the Bitcoin protocol as a reward for miners. As such, it can also be
considered an upper bound on the cost of production for all circulating BTC
, assuming miners are rational profit motivated actors. If $1B in total block reward is offered, we can expect miners to spend and compete with up to $1B worth of investment to earn that reward.
The Thermocap is currently sitting at $30.3B whilst the Bitcoin market cap is at $900B. If we consider the thermocap as the 'maximum aggregate cost of BTC production', Bitcoin is currently trading at a multiple of 29.7x above production cost. This is a 2,870% premium to lifetime aggregate miner input costs!
Thermocap Live Chart
We can take this concept one step further using the
Workbench tool
, to construct
Bitcoin's
block subsidy model
(originally developed by the newest addition to the Glassnode analyst team,
@permabullnino
).
Here we calculate multiples on the Thermocap (2x, 6x, 32x and 64x) to reflect a growing
monetary premium
of the Bitcoin network above its aggregate cost of production. We can spot some interesting behaviours:
Each cycle adds to the minimum monetary premium at the end of bear markets
. The raw Thermocap (1x) caught the 2011 bear bottom, 2x Thermocap caught the 2015 market, and 6x Thermocap provided support for 2018-19 and March 2020.
Bull cycle tops have generally peaked between 32x and 64x
as the market gets overextended and exceeds the cost of production by large multiples.
At the current prices, the topping model of 64x Thermocap reflects a Bitcoin market cap of $1.94 Trillion ($103k BTC price). Bitcoin is currently trading just slightly under the 32x Thermocap model, which is located at $969B.
Bitcoin Block Subsidy Model Live Chart
Finally, we can observe this phenomena by taking the ratio between the market cap and the Thermocap. This oscillator reflects the changing magnitude of Bitcoins monetary premium relative to its aggregate cost of production.
We can see the aforementioned steadily rising floor value, or 'minimum monetary premium' reached at the lows of each market cycle. The peak of bullish market cycles can also be seen to top out at relatively consistent levels exceeding 32x the Thermocap model.

Only the HODLers Remain
The relatively low utilisation of Bitcoin block-space has been widely discussed of late, with a case to be made on both sides as to whether it is bullish, bearish, or both:
Bull case
is that it is a result of growing adoption of efficient transaction techniques such as SegWit, transaction batching, and usage of Lightning Network.
Bear case
is that the 50%+ correction in May resulted in a flushing out of many retail traders and investors, and thus interest in the protocol has waned since early 2021.
The most likely case is both of these are in effect.
The chart below shows that transaction counts have indeed declined since May, returning to what could be considered a 'bearish onchain activity channel'. Higher transaction counts are characteristic of bullish conditions as new entrants swarm into the network and demand for block-space increases accordingly. Conversely, lower transaction demand can signal fewer market participants are active, and less relative interest in the asset.
Transaction counts are currently at around 175k to 200k transactions per day which are similar to levels seen in the 2018 bear market.
Transaction Counts (EA) Live Chart
As exchanges increasingly deploy transaction batching techniques (processing multiple client withdrawals in a single transaction), transaction counts alone can be misleading. Thus we must also assess the number of active on-chain entities.
We can see however, that a very similar pattern is in play which speaks to the more bearish case of reduced participation being a dominant driver. This adds weight to the argument that the market may be dominated by HODLers and traders, with less participation by newer entrants and retail speculators.
Active Entities Live Chart
We can confirm this by looking at the Entities Net Growth metric which describes the difference between new on-chain entrants (holding new coins), and those leaving the network (spending all their coins). Here we can see with each market cycle a rising 'floor value' of new entities. This describes Bitcoin reaching a wider audience over time, and the size of the consistently buying HODLer base. We can also see that bull markets experience a steep increase in new participants, many of which slow-down after market tops.
The current market has returned to the upper bound of the 2018-20 bear market baseline, of around 13k new entities per day.
Entities Net Growth Live Chart
The assessment we can take away from this, is that the highest likelihood is that the majority of today's market participants, are longer-term HODLers and accumulators. The question is, can they hold the line and provide sufficient buy support?
If we look to the percent entities in profit, we can make two observations:
Around 9.6% of entities hold coins, that were accumulated during August and September, and are now underwater (held at an unrealised loss). This represents a 58% retracement of the August high, suggesting a non-trivial number of buyers from May-July took profits on the way up.
This fractal is remarkably similar to the July-October recovery after the March 2020 sell-off.
We also see this March 2020 recovery fractal in the Short-term Holder MVRV. This metric will trade at 1.0 when price is equal to the onchain cost basis of STHs. After a capitulation event (MVRV < 1.0) and relief rally (MVRV > 1.0), STHs who accumulated on the way up are having their conviction to hold tested.
Prices have returned to the cost basis of short-term holders. Given we estimated ~58% of them are already underwater, the key question is whether these buyers from August and September will sell their coins at a loss and drive prices lower. The other question is whether the HODLers who remain can provide enough buy side support if they do?
STH-MVRV Live Chart
Conviction to HODL
To answer the second half of this question, we assess the conviction to HODL by existing coin holders amidst fairly historic volatility (and many rolls of the FUD dice).
We start with the Coin-days Destroyed 90 metric (CDD-90) which calculates the cumulative sum of lifespan spent over the last 90-days. This metric will peak when large volumes of old coins are spent (usually in bull markets), and decline during periods of accumulation and HODLing.
CDD-90 is currently trading at very low levels of around 150k CDD. This level is coincident with periods of large scale accumulation, including both early bull markets, and later stage bear markets.
CDD-90 Live Chart
We can also see that the relative supply held by Short-term Holders has reached an all-time low of 20% of circulating supply. This is a rare occurrence that has historically described the late stage accumulation periods of bear markets by the smarter money.
Relative STH-LTH Supply PNL Live Chart
This also manifests as a multi-year low in Highly Liquid supply, a metric that has returned to December 2018 levels. Highly liquid coins are those that are located on exchanges and other venues where coins can trivially change hands with the click of a button.
Liquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart
We can confirm this downtrend is influenced by the withdrawal of coins from exchanges, which continues at a significant rate. The exchange net position change metric demonstrates a clear change in character and market preference following March 2020. The market shifted from a regime of dominant inflows, to one of outflows. July to September has been a historically significant period of net outflows, ranging between 80k and 100k BTC/month.
Exchange Net Position Change
As coins migrate out of highly liquid exchange balances, and into investor wallets, they start to mature. Initially, these coins are likely to be re-spent in response to market volatility, but over time, the are increasingly considered illiquid, dormant, and more likely to remain in cold storage. These transitional coins are referred to as Liquid supply which we can see has been in macro decline since 2016.
If we consider the total supply of Highly Liquid and Liquid coins, we have 3.117M (HL) + 1.229M (L) = 4.346M BTC freely circulating (~23% of circulating supply).
Liquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart
The converse of the above charts is that Long-term holders now hold an all-time-high of over 80% of circulating BTC. Of note in the 2021 cycle, is the relatively small distribution of coins that occurred in the Q1-2021 bull compared to previous cycles. LTH supply drew down to only 67.7% of supply where previous cycles were between 54% and 58%.
We can also note the speed of the recovery which indicates that 12.3% of the circulating supply was accumulated in the 2020-21 bull market, and remains unspent today.
Despite relatively low on-chain activity, and a number of market fractals resembling bearish conditions, there remains an undertone of extreme HOLDing and accumulation behaviour. This is somewhat unique to this market cycle and is a dynamic worth keeping an eye on.

Lightning Network Adoption
In the headlines this week is the adoption of Bitcoins Lightning Network (LN), primarily by El Salvador, and by Twitter as an integrated payment feature. We have also released a suite of Lightning Network metrics to Glassnode Studio that helps describe thew extraordinary growth of the protocol over recent months.
The number of LN nodes is one of many metrics at an all-time-high, reaching 15.6k nodes this week.
Lightning Node Count Live Chart
The number of LN channels have reached highs of 73k, representing an average of 4.6 channels per node. This is around double the number of channels that were live through the period from 2019-20, with most of this growth occurring since May 2021.
Lightning Channel Count Live Chart
Total BTC capacity in LN channels has seen explosive growth over the last nine months, rising 170% in 2021 to reach 2,904 BTC (~$127M). 514 of these coins were added to LN channels in September alone.
Lightning Capacity Live Chart
Finally, the mean and median channel size has been climbing steadily as adoption and confidence in the protocol grows. The average channel capacity is accelerating higher from the stable baseline of ~0.028 BTC in 2019-20 to 0.040 BTC today. Median channel size has also lifted to 0.01 BTC, having risen notably through July and August.
The adoption and growth of the Lightning Network, both via scaling out in El Salvador, and in Twitter implementations, is an exciting challenge for the industry. Be sure to check out our Lightning metrics and dashboard to keep track of LN adoption and performance over the coming months.

After a fairly brutal September, this rally has brought with it renewed optimism for the last quarter of 2021.
Similar to our observation during the rally in
late July
, a non-trivial volume of BTC changed hands during the recent consolidation trading range. We can see this via inspection of the coin volume which has now returned to holding an unrealised profit. This week we will analyse this return to profitability and how the fractals compare to previous market cycles. We will also look into the mining market which continues to recover after the Great Migration commenced in May.

Return to Profitability
In on-chain analysis, we generally consider coins that are spent (especially for entity-adjusted variants) to have changed hands, as existing coin holders sell, and new buyers take possession. When prices consolidate in a range for an extended period, and a large volume of coins transact on-chain, this can be considered as zone of accumulation. As such we can consider this an established cost basis for many buyers.
As prices rally above this trading range this week, approximately 10.3% of the circulating supply returned to an unrealised profit. We can therefore deduce, that alongside the $29k to $40k range in May-July, the recent lows of $40k to $41k represented a significant 'value add' zone for buyers who stepped in and purchased to set a price floor. A total of 86.6% of all circulating BTC are currently held at an unrealised profit.
Supply in Profit Live Chart
If we inspect the breakdown of profitability between Long- (LTH) and Short-Term (STH) Holders we can see that overall, STHs benefited the most from this rally. Around 15.6% of the BTC supply is currently held by investors who purchased within the last ~155-days and are at an unrealised profit.
LTHs in profit currently hold 73.4% of the supply, leaving a remaining 11% of coins held at a loss (split 31:69 STH:LTH). As a larger portion of the market return to profit, it creates incentives for some investors to take profits, but also can recover conviction to hold onto their winners.
Relative LTH-STH Supply Live Chart
The magnitude of net unrealised profit has also reached an interesting milestone, bouncing off a NUPL value of 0.5. This indicates that the total unrealised profit held in the coin supply is equivalent to approximately 50% of the market cap (approximately $450B in global unrealised gains).
If the market were to continue to trend higher and into a bullish continuation, this fractal would be similar to both the 2013 and 2017 market. In both prior cycles, a NUPL value of 0.5 acted as a 'support' level during major corrections as the market's profitability and conviction to hold was tested, bounced and subsequently rallied higher.
Conversely, falling below 0.5 again could potentially trigger more coin holders to spend coins in fear of seeing their unrealised profits diminish further.
NUPL Live Chart
On-chain Spending Behaviour
As the market rallies higher, it is valuable to observe the various cohorts who are transacting on-chain to establish a case for both capital inflows, outflows, and aggregate market sentiment.
This week saw a marked decline in investors spending coins that were held at a loss. Realised losses fell to a multi-week low of around $175M per day. On the other hand, realised profits rose sharply to $996M/day. These observations are likely a function of:
More coins returning to profit overall (discussed above)
Profits taken by traders who bought the recent lows
Investors who may have bought the March-May top 'getting their money back' closer to, or just above their cost basis.
Given the market continued to hold most of the weeks gains, this also indicates that around $1.75B worth of capital is flowing into the market as buy side demand per day.
Realised PnL Live Chart
The structural downtrend on old coin volume dominance continues this week, reaching a multi-year low of around 2%. In the pre-bull phase of 2019-20, old coin volume represented around 4% of all volume moved on-chain as a baseline. This spiked in late 2020 and early 2021 as long term investors took profits in the bull market.
With old coin dominance at multi-year lows, is suggests two dynamics are at play:
Old Hands have strong conviction
and are not spending at current prices.
Young coin dominance is at multi-year highs
which indicates the same liquid supply is transacting and likely being absorbed by new buyers (as noted in net capital inflows from the previous chart).
Spent Volume Age Bands Live Chart
Breaking down the on-chain volume by transaction size, we can also see that very large transaction sizes ($10M+) continue to dominate. Overall entity-adjusted transaction volumes have largely returned to the peak of between $13.6B and $16.8B per day. The rising dominance of large transaction sizes hints to the increased maturation of Bitcoin as a macro scale asset with increasing interest from high net worth individuals, trading desks, and institutions.
Transaction Breakdown by Size Live Chart
On the spending behaviour of Long-term Holders, the overall profitability of spent coins has fallen to relatively low levels. LTH-SOPR has returned to a value of 2.0 which indicates that spent coins have a profit multiple of around 200% (i.e. aggregate cost basis of $24k for coins spent at $48k).
As a longer term cyclical metric, the LTH-SOPR usually trades in this range during late stage bear markets, and early stage bull markets. This is a result of lengthy sideways price action which compresses profit multiples, even for longer-term investors.
LTH-SOPR Live Chart
For Short-Term Holders, we also have relatively constructive signals, with the STH-SOPR metric rallying back into profitability. In bullish market structure, a return of STH-SOPR to a value of 1.0 generally suggests:
STHs have stopped taking profits, else the metric would trend higher. This suggests conviction to hold remains.
Some STHs are panic selling and realising losses, often pushing STH-SOPR slightly below 1 during price pull-backs.
As a result, a SOPR value of 1.0 usually indicates market support, which in this case has played out. A return to profitability alongside positive or sustained price action indicates that sufficient demand is present to absorb spent coins, providing confluence to many of the charts discussed above.
STH-SOPR Live Chart
Weekly Feature: Mining Recovery
The Bitcoin mining industry experienced the most dramatic short term disruption in all history, with over 50% of the network hash-power coming offline throughout May. Despite this massive impact to its industrial base, the Bitcoin hash-power network has been on a consistent path to recovery every since.
After bottoming out in late July, protocol mining difficulty has risen by 39%, with a further additional upwards adjustment of around 3.9% expected this week. Mining difficulty has now returned to last 2020 levels, requiring around 80 sextillion hashes to solve a block (that is 8 followed by 22 zeros!).
Difficulty Live Chart
The Difficulty ribbon is also about to flip over and signal full recovery, as the slowest 200-day moving average crosses over the fastest 9-day moving average. The only comparable difficulty ribbon flip to the current market was following the December 2018 bear market capitulation event that took prises down 50% to $3k.
The 2018-19 mining recovery took a total of 164-days to completely reverse the bearish difficulty ribbon signal. The current market has been in recovery for 120-days and is likely to complete the flip after the next upwards difficulty adjustment.
Difficulty Ribbon Live Chart
Finally, we can look to miner total revenues to assess overall income for the mining industry. Despite a 50% reduction in the block-subsidy from 12.5 BTC/block to 6.25 BTC/block in May 2020, total USD miner revenue is up significantly.
Remember, miners have CAPEX (hardware, facilities, logistics) and OPEX (power, personnel, maintenance etc) costs that are denominated in fiat currencies. Comparing the current aggregate mining income of $40M per day to revenues observed around the 2020 halving event, we can see that miner revenues are up:
+275% since the pre-halving period of $14M to $18M/day
+630% compared to the post-halving period of $6M to $8M/day
Despite dramatic shifts in the mining market, multiple deep price corrections, and a halving event in May 2020, the Bitcoin block reward value continues to rise, creating incentives for the market to adapt, innovate and recover. Quite incredible really.

Following an impressive rally from the September lows, the market has managed to hold onto the gains whilst on-chain activity has commenced a welcome climb higher.
This week we analyse the increased leveraged creeping into derivatives markets, the impressive growth of long-term holder supply, and the recent elevation of on-chain activity. Across many facets of the Bitcoin market, signals continue to paint a constructive view for prices, and market sentiment remains positive.

On-chain Activity Climbs Higher
The first week of October has experienced a long awaited boost in network activity, increasing the probability that new demand is beginning to enter in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Active Entities, the count of individual participants on-chain each day, has grown 19% to this week, reaching around 291k active entities per day. This value is on par with counts from late 2020 at the beginning of the last bull run. More active market participants has historically correlated with growing interest in the asset during early stage bull markets.
Link to live chart
Along with an elevated number of market participants, the typical coin value of transactions has also increased. Since mid September, the median transaction size has risen to over 1.3 BTC. The last time the Bitcoin network saw a median transaction size above 1.6 BTC was March 2020 during the liquidity crash.
An increased typical transaction size is not synonymous with price appreciation, but indicative of larger and even institutional sized capital flows present on-chain. Generally speaking, periods near the end of bear markets are when smart money start to accumulate in size. These periods are often characterised by lower (but rising) on-chain activity and increasingly large transaction sizes.
Link to Workbench chart
The dollar value of volume moving on-chain has also increased to meaningful levels. By viewing Transfer Volume (USD) as a percentage of the Realized Cap, we can directly compare network activity to the value 'stored' in the asset. The chart below presents 'Realized Velocity', calculated as a ratio between USD denominated on-chain transaction volume, and the Realized Cap. This gives a sense of the level of demand volume relative to the value of the coin supply valued at the time it was last spent on-chain.
Transfer Volume greater than 3% of Realized Cap
typically marks the beginning of a bullish market phase as network utility increases relative to realized valuation.
Transfer Volume less than 3% of Realized Cap
indicates a more bearish phase where network utility is low or declining relative to the realized valuation.
Transfer Volume has once again broken above the 3% threshold suggesting growing demand for on-chain settlement of value. This is a bullish a development worth watching in the coming weeks based on its high historical signal.
Link to Workbench chart
Long-Term Holders HODL On
To further support the constructive increase on-chain activity, the supply held by Long-Term Holders (LTH) is showing no signs of slowing down. LTHs distributed coins from October 2020 through to March 20201 where their held supply bottom out at 10.91M BTC.
Over the last 7-months, HODling behaviour has dominated and over 2.37M BTC have migrated across the Short-to-Long Term holder threshold (~155days). To put this into context, only 186k BTC have been freshly mined in that same period, meaning LTHs have HODLed 12.7x more coins than have been mined on average.
LTH Supply Live Chart
Using the Workbench tool, we can quantify the magnitude of LTH accumulation relative to current coin issuance to miners. Here we take the ratio between the 30-day change in LTH supply (blue), and the 30-day change in circulating supply (orange, equals total issuance).
This ratio is shown in pink below and represents the multiple of monthly coin issuance that is being accumulated/HODLed (+ve) or distributed (-ve) by LTHs. February 2021 shows that LTHs distributed heavily, reaching 26.4x the number of mined coins. Conversely, June was an all-time-high of relative accumulation, reaching 27.7x issuance.
Since July, LTH accumulation/HODLing has been quite consistent between 13.6 and 15.0x issuance indicating the number of coins taken out of circulation are significantly more than are being newly minted.
Live Workbench Chart
Further corroborating evidence for this observation is the Revived Supply 1yr+ metric which presents the volume of 1yr+ old coins that are spent each day.
During bull markets
, it is typical to see LTHs distribute into market strength which eventually puts in a local or global top when supply overwhelms demand (uptrend, pink).
After global tops are established
, LTHs slow spending and await cheaper prices to recommence accumulation (downtrend, blue)
When prices reach 'value zones'
smart money investors start to accumulate which is characterised by low, baseline levels of revived supply as older coins remain dormant and young coins change hands (sideways, green)
In the current market structure, revived supply suggests the market remains in a relative accumulation zone, with low volumes of revived supply coming back into liquid circulation.
Revived Supply Live Chart
Alongside higher prices, a very large portion of the UTXO set have also returned to profit, reaching 95.7% of all UTXOs. This is an uplift of around 11.3% since the September lows. Note also that whilst the market correction since May was deep, it did not result in the proportion of UTXOs in profit falling to the extreme lows of 40% to 60% seen in the 2018-19 bear, or in March 2020. Note also that in strong bull markets, UTXOs in profit can maintain values above 90% for many months at a time.
UTXOs in Profit Live chart
Leverage Creeps Back Into Derivatives Markets
The positive sentiment and constructive price action has also started to be reflected in derivatives markets with climbing open interest, healthy contango in futures markets, and rising perpetual swap funding rates. Futures open interest has risen by $5.6B (+45%) since the lows in September. Note that this magnitude of open interest is similar to that in early September, and in mid-May, both of which preceded significant long squeezes.
Futures Open Interest Live chart
Constructive future prices can also be seen in the futures term structure, where the consensus price ranges across exchanges are highlighted in blue below. Through to the end of the year, traders on most exchanges (excl. Huobi) are pricing Bitcoin at approximately $58.5k (a 12.4% annualised premium). Traders on FTX and Huobi are currently the outliers for March 2022, trading at a $800 premium, and a $3.1k discount respectively, to the consensus price of around $60.1k.
Futures term Structure Live chart
The 3-month annualised futures basis has also traded higher throughout October, rallying up to +12.4% this week. May-July was a particularly bearish period where futures markets were pricing in only a +2% to +5% annualised premium 3-months out. The premium in late-September returned to this +5% low and accompanied relatively bearish market sentiment. However, such relatively low futures basis has shown to be a strong indicator for a counter trend rally in 2020 and 2021.
Futures 3-month Basis Live Chart
Perpetual swap markets are also growing increasingly bullish over the last week, with funding rates trading between +0.01% and +0.02% across all exchanges. At the time of writing, funding rates are declining towards the lower end of this range, which suggests that perhaps traders are taking on leverage, however in a more controlled manner to previous periods. However, the probability of short-term volatility lead by a long squeeze does increase alongside elevated funding rates and climbing open interest and is a risk to pay attention to.
Perpetual Funding Rate Live Chart
To close, we will look at options markets which are also seeing an expansion in open interest, rising by $3.6B (+64%) through October so far. Options markets still represent a relatively small portion of trade volume (< $1B typical), however their growth reflects a maturity of the market, providing new avenues for hedging of risk, tools for miners and traders to capture volatility premiums, and vehicles for price speculation.
Options open interest Live Chart
It is not uncommon for derivatives markets to see an influx of open interest, futures premiums, and positive funding rates alongside positive price action. Whilst this does increase the likelihood of a leverage squeeze, it must be viewed in combination with fundamental factors observed in spot markets and on-chain for a holistic view.
What we can see is that in many regards, the current constructive price action is supported by very healthy trends in accumulation, HODLing behaviour, and increases in on-chain activity and network utilisation.

Long-Term Holders Start Realising Profits
To set the stage, we will begin to the URPD metric which presents the distribution of prices at which the circulating supply was last spent on-chain. At the time of writing, only 311.8k BTC were last moved at higher prices. Note also that the owners of these coins HODLed throughout all the ups, downs and volatility of the last 6 months and did not sell.
With only 1.66% of the supply held at an unrealised loss, this means 98.34% of coins are now held at an unrealised profit.
Live Chart
As the market pushes towards the ATH, and investors hold increasingly large unrealised profits, the incentive to sell is growing.
We recently released an article
which explores the macro cyclical behaviour of Bitcoins strongest hands: the Long-Term Holders (LTH). These entities are classified as owners of coins that have been held for ~155-days or longer and are generally considered as the 'Bitcoin smart money'.
Typical on-chain behaviour of LTHs can be summarised as buying low (accumulation in a bear) and selling high (selling into bullish strength). The trend of LTHs increasing their spending of coins usually coincides with price breaking the previous ATH. Thus it is expected that this trend or more old coin spending will start to develop as market prices trade higher.
Over the past week, we can see a slight softening of the LTH net position change metric. This suggests a degree of LTH spending is occurring as prices rally above $60k.
Live Chart
This spending behaviour has flowed into the Realised Cap HODL waves. This metric reflects the proportional realised value of coins categorised into age brackets.
Here we can see that the downtrend in young coins (< 1-month), which had persisted since February, has experienced a slight uptick this week. When younger coin bands thicken up, it can only be a result of older coins being spent, destroying their accumulated lifespan and, and assumed to be changing hands.
Live Chart
As volumes pick back up in the on-chain transaction space, we can again revisit the Binary Coin-days Destroyed metric. This metric has a 7-day moving average applied and is very useful for identifying trends of older coins being spent. General interpretation of this metric is:
Low Sideways Values:
Accumulation as old coins remain dormant
Uptrends:
As older coins are spent, usually distributing into market strength
Downtrends:
After market peaks as owners of older coins slow their spending and prepare for accumulation.
This week has seen a very early sign of an uptick on older spending, confirming that more coin-days were destroyed than the long term average. That said, bullish markets can often absorb many months of such distribution behaviour as is observed in all previous cycles.
Live Chart
Using the Workbench tool, we can establish the BTC volume that has been spent, both realising losses and realising profits. The chart below plots out the 90-day sum of realised profits (green) and realised losses (red), both denominated in BTC.
Marked out are key macro shifts in sentiment and direction, such as market tops, and capitulation bottoms. Over the past 90-days, a total of 1.63M BTC worth of profits, and 676k BTC in losses have been realised (total of 2.3M BTC). Note that the realised profits metric remains significantly below the market tops in 2018 (5.99M BTC), 2019 (2.50M BTC) and most recently in Q2 2021 (4.58M BTC).
Workbench Chart
The Realised Profits-to-Value Ratio (RPV) shows the scale of these realised profits to the market on-chain cost basis (Realised cap).
In other words, this metric compares the magnitude of profitable volume spent on-chain (assumed sell pressure), to the value that investors have stored in Bitcoin (sum of all coin value at the price when it was last spent).
Compared to previous market tops and bull markets, the current spending is relatively insignificant compared to the network valuation. Whilst we have now confirmed that profitable coins are on the move, these metrics indicate that current demand is sufficient to absorb any sell-side pressure applied.
Live Chart
Finally, closing out our investigation into on-chain market structure, we can look to the Exchange Net Position change metric to see if these coins are flowing into exchanges for sale. What we can see is that after an extended period of sustained outflows, the on-net change in exchange balances has returned neutral.
This suggests that over the last 30-days, inflows have been matched with outflows which further indicates that there is sufficient demand at present to absorb the sell-side. It does however indicate fewer coins are being withdrawn and is obviously less constructive for price than net outflows.
Interestingly, this market structure is very similar to the period in late 2020 as Bitcoin approached last cycles $20k ATH. All in all, the market remains quite bullish, however it is likely that this early signal of older coins, owned by LTHs being spent on-chain will continue as it has in all previous Bitcoin cycles.
Live Chart
Derivatives Explode Higher
The derivatives markets for Bitcoin have seen marked increases in open interest and volume, particularly in the options space. Options open interest expanded by a remarkable +107% ($6.3B) over the course of October alone. Whilst not an all-time-high, it is not all that far away.
Live Chart
Options trade volume has similarly seen an extraordinary week, rising up to $1.5B as Bitcoin prices breached the $60k price level. Options trade volume has only reached levels this high on three prior occasions, all at similar price points between March and May this year.
Live Chart
The favoured options contracts appear to be call options with strike prices above $100k, with a typical open interest of $250M to $350M for call options expiring at the end of the year. The open interest in call options dwarfs that in put options, aligning with the overall bullish market sentiment.
Live Chart
In futures markets, open interest has climbed, although certainly not to the same relative rate as in the options space. The chart below shows perpetual futures open interest denominated in BTC to help isolate open interest growth, from the influence of the coin price.
Open interest in perpetual markets is currently around 225k BTC which is coincident with a number or periods that preceded leverage flush outs. Primary examples are April, May and September local tops which were all followed by cascading long liquidations. However a similarly high level of open interest was seen in July before shorts were squeezed out at the $29k bottom.
Live Chart
Despite futures open interest approaching ATHs, the volume traded appears to be declining on a macro scale, and has been since the sell-off in May. In a high open interest but low volume environment, it could set the stage for heightened probabilities for a liquidation cascade, as volumes may be insufficient to support the flush out once it gets going.
Whilst the market at large remains relatively healthy, and demand is meeting LTH sell-side, exercising some caution given the elevated leverage across both futures and options markets is likely prudent.

The market pushed above Aprils previous ATH ($64,717) to reach a new peak of $66,928. The market has since corrected, putting in a weekly low of $59,722.
The BITO ETF surpassed $1.1B in assets under management in the first two days of trading, outpacing an 18-yr record set by the $GLD Gold ETF. As the underlying of the BITO ETF are Bitcoin futures trading on the CME exchange, this week we will analyse the explosive growth in open interest and volume in CME markets.
We also continue our assessment of long-term holder spending behaviour, which appears to be slowing down as conviction returns during this pullback. We finish our analysis with the introduction of new metrics and pricing models developed by our community of analysts. These have all been added to Workbench as pre-sets.

Bitcoin Futures Backed ETF Launches
The headline news in the industry last week was the launch of the BITO ETF product which utilises CME futures contracts as the underlying. Open interest in CME contracts has exploded higher through October, rising by $3.95 Billion (265%). This set a new a new all-time-high of $5.44B for futures open interest on the CME exchange.
Live Chart
Trading volume also peaked at a new high of $7.66B on the 20 October, the day of the current price ATH. Traders moved an additional $490M worth of volume on CME futures relative to the previous peak set in Feb 2021.
Live Chart
Funding rates in perpetual swap futures markets also reached a new local high on the same day prices reached the $66k. This signalled that many traders were opening leveraged long positions amidst the excitement of the rally and ETF launch. As often happens during periods of exuberance and high leverage, prices quickly corrected, flushing out excess leverage, hitting stop-losses and returning funding rates to lower levels.
Note that funding rates remain at similar levels as observed just prior to the early September flush out. With futures open interest remaining near all time highs, a risk of further downside to clear even more leverage does remain in play.
Live Chart
Lastly on derivatives markets, and in a more constructive light, the proportion of futures margin collateralised by volatile crypto assets has continue to decline. Crypto-margined futures contracts have fallen from 70.1% in April (on the Coinbase direct listing), to 44.6% today.
The converse of this observation is that stablecoin or fiat collateral is now posted for 55.4% of futures open interest (vs 29.9% in April). This is a much healthier state of leverage across the market, where price volatility in the posted collateral is gradually declining in favor of stable value assets, and fiat currency.
Live Chart
Old Coins On The Move
Last week we covered
the very early signs of older coins, reflecting more experienced long-term holders (LTHs), being spent and taking profits. This is typical behaviour around new price ATHs, and after another week of price action, we can reassess the state of this trend.
Long-Term Holder supply declined by around 39.5k BTC over the last two weeks. However when we look at this in context, it follows a period of incredible accumulation and HODLing, where LTH held supply increased by 2.42M BTC since the lows in March.
Current LTH supply is 680k BTC higher than it was this time last year, and even after the weeks spending, is starting to reverse back to the upside. This observation suggests perhaps LTH distribution has so far been more of an 'event', than a trend.
Live Chart
We can see the magnitude of lifespan destroyed by these older coins on the move in the Dormancy metric. Dormancy presents the average number of coin-days (lifespan) destroyed per unit of BTC spent that day. General interpretation is:
Higher values
mean older average age and typically indicates old coins are being distributed (typical in bull markets)
Lower values
mean the average age of coins is relatively young and is typical of bear markets and accumulation periods.
A pre-bull market Dormancy baseline of around 50-days was established throughout 2019-20. This gives us a reference point for what constitutes accumulation vs distribution. Incredibly, the accumulation from May through September shows up as extremely low Dormancy values, getting below 25-days in mid-September (strong accumulation signal). There has been a slight uptick in this metric over the last two weeks, however it continues to trade around the pre-bull baseline of 50-days, suggesting LTH spending is modest, but not extreme.
Live Chart
A similar pattern can be observed in the Binary Coin-days Destroyed metric which is beginning to trade higher on a 7-day average basis. This is again very similar to the behaviour observed in prior bull markets where LTHs commence distribution around new price ATHs. A similar pattern is observable from October 2020 to Jan 2021 during the rally from $10k to $42k.
Live Chart
The Realised Cap HODL waves confirm the above observations as younger coin bands (warmer colours) have seen a slight uplift. As older coins are spent, a larger realised value of coins move into these younger bands, and older bands will shrink proportionally.
Live Chart
The Short-Term Holder SOPR metric has also signalled a return of conviction, with a reset back to a value of 1.0. SOPR reflects the aggregate profitability of coins spent that day, with values greater than 1.0 signalling net profits, and less than 1.0 net losses.
STHs tend to be the marginal buyers and sellers, and STH-SOPR often signals support (in bull) and resistance (in bears) when it resets back to a value of 1.0. This indicates that both profitable, and loss holding coins remain dormant and signifies a return of conviction. In a bull market, SOPR resets offers a reasonable case for the lows of a correction, even if only for a shorter term bounce.
Overall, a handful of Long-Term Holders have started spending their coins to realise profits and is showing up in elevated destroyed lifespan metrics. However, the uplift in Dormancy and Binary CDD remain fairly small relative to prior bull cycle distributions, and even STHs have stopped spending during this correction. With LTH supply already starting to recover, the most likely interpretation is that the vast majority of coin holders are still expecting and waiting for higher prices.
Weekly Feature: Community Workbench Charts
We are pleased to have released a suite of pre-set charts to Workbench that are constructed and shared by our community of analysts.
The first is the Top Cap model which was invested by the grandfather of on-chain analytics himself,
@woonomic
. This model applies a multiple of 35 to the all-time average price of Bitcoin to establish a cycle top model which has picked all four prior macro market tops.
Live Chart
The second is the Illiquid Supply Shock (ISS) Ratio proposed by
@WClementeIII
. Where coins are primarily flowing out of liquid circulation, the ISS Ratio will trend higher suggesting increased probability of a supply shock. Conversely, downtrends in ISS Ratio will occur as illiquid coins are spent back into liquid circulation, reducing the probability of a supply shock.
Live Chart
The Realised Price to Liveliness Ratio (RPLR) was introduced by
@dorinvesting
, which modifies the Realised Price using Liveliness. By taking the ratio between the two, a 'fair value' model fo
r
Bitcoin can be established that accounts for periods of time where HODLing, or spending dominates investor behaviour.
Where more HODLing is taking place
, more coin-days are created, Liveliness trends towards zero, and RPLR fair value is estimated higher.
Where less HODLing is taking place
, more coin-days are destroyed, Liveliness trends towards unity, and RPLR fair value is estimated lower.
Live Chart
Lastly, we have the Bitcoin Price Temperature, crafted by
@dilutionproof
and is used to establish a mean reversion model based on the cyclical nature of Bitcoin investment and halving cycles. It provides both an oscillator, and pricing bands for assessing which price levels coincide with fair-value, or extreme outlier standard deviation multiples.

Despite the market softening from the highs and price dipping briefly below $60k, Bitcoin is still up a sweltering 40% in the month of October, motivated in part by excitement over the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ($BITO). That mark of +40% is the highest single month of gains for BTC since December 2020. In fact, the total price range of Octobers monthly price candle (including wicks) was $23,205, larger in USD value than Bitcoin's entire price range from genesis to December 2020.

Profit and Spending Levels Are Muted
When new highs are made, the behavior of holders and the profit-taking activity of investors can inform us about the health, and sentiment of the market. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) is the profitability of spent Bitcoin relative to the realised value on a daily basis. Here we ignore coins younger than 1-hour by employing Adjusted SOPR (aSOPR), to filter out day trading noise and relay transactions.
The current levels of spent profit taking on-chain are mild considering the all-time high was broken ten days ago, and resemble the activity of an early bull market. It appears that current holders are by and large unwilling to move their coins here, and are waiting for higher prices. Positive aSOPR during consolidation or upwards price action is constructive as it suggests the market can absorb the sell-side whilst maintaining price support levels.
Live chart
A lot of attention is paid to the Long-Term Holders, but their high time preference counterparts (the Short-Term Holders) can also inform us about market conditions. The standing profit level of Short-Term Holders (STH) over time is a reliable bellwether for bull/bear sentiment as STH often represent the marginal buyer/seller.
In the chart below:
Values over 1 (green zones)
indicate that Short-Term Holders are stepping in to buy when price nears their cost basis, observed by a bounce off the black line. Sellers are finding liquidity and newer holders are holding coins at break-even or in profit.
Values below 1 (red zones)
show periods where Short-Term Holders in the aggregate are holding coins at a loss. When the black line acts as overhead resistance, it means the Short-Term Holder group is unable to pull themselves into a state of profit.
Live chart
Another perspective of on-chain profitability is via the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metric (NUPL), filtered below to include only Long-Term Holders (LTH). This is the total standing profit level of all
entities
that have been holding coins for at least 155 days.
The NUPL zone between 0.50 and 0.75 (meaning LTH are sitting on 50-75% net profit) has historically been a pivot spot for the market. When LTH test this zone and stand firm by not selling, price tends to rally higher in the following weeks and months.
This dynamic played out in the 2013-14 double run bull market, and also in 2017. In 2019, Long-Term Holders failed to hold and capitulated. Here again in 2021, Long-Term Holder NUPL is looking for support out of this key zone. In each previous instance where LTH-NUPL exited this zone higher, price was breaking the all-time high.
Live chart
Leveraged Long Traders Take Losses
With the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF in the same week as all-time highs, activity in the futures market has been heavy and bustling. Although the ETF exists in the traditional expiring contracts market, activity has also been volatile in perpetual swaps where the funding rate governs premium rates.
A positive funding rate means that longs (betting on price to rise) have an imbalance of leverage to their side, and those traders pay a premium to shorts for the privilege of keeping their positions open. Divergences between funding bias and price can highlight risks for traders taking the other side, especially when open interest is elevated.
If funding is positive and price continues to rise
, then the premium is aligned with sentiment, and is the cost of doing business.
If funding is positive and price goes sideways/down,
leveraged long traders betting against price are uniquely vulnerable to liquidations.
The chart below shows moments of price weakness (red arrows) following rises in funding (blue arrows), and the subsequent de-leveraging (orange arrows) that occurs when losing positions are closed out. At the moment, funding rates are declining alongside price, suggesting that leveraged traders are taking a more cautious approach, which is a healthier position for the market by and large.
Live chart
Larger amounts of long liquidations tend to follow moments of high positive funding that are met with sideways or declining price. In turn, cascading short liquidations can occur when negative funding rates (indicating an abundance of short leverage) meet rising price.
In the chart below, the red arrows from the funding rate chart above have been carried over, demonstrating the liquidation waves that follow divergences between funding and price. Of note are the $3.5 million in long liquidations that occurred hourly after the ATH break on October 21-22. Some traders went long
immediately
upon reaching price discovery and were quickly swatted down.
Coincident with our funding rate observation above, liquidations have slowed down in the last few days, suggesting leveraged traders are taking more care with their positions and exposure.
Live chart
The last futures related chart we'll peek at today is the percentage of crypto-margined futures, declining precipitously since the spring 2021 highs. Futures contracts can be collateralized in two ways: crypto or cash.
Cash-margined futures
are placed with cash or cash equivalents, like stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. These tend to be more stable collateral assets than their crypto counterparts.
Crypto-margined futures
are placed with crypto assets like Bitcoin. In these contracts, a trader's risk and collateral are based on the same asset, thus the same volatility (i.e. BTC). If both the position and hedge are losing value, a trader has little wiggle room before liquidations set in, compounding risk but multiplying the potential reward.
Since the fervour of the spring 2021 bull run, crypto-margined futures contracts have been on the decline, falling from an average around 66-69% down to 46% today. This means that over half (54%) of futures contracts presently are margined with cash or cash equivalents, reducing the effects of compounded volatility.
Live chart
Supply and Network Dynamics Look Bullish
The RVT Ratio, initially presented by Glassnode's own
Checkmate
, aims to compare the dollar value transferred on the network to its relative valuation. As an on-chain to on-chain ratio, RVT offers a consistent and reliable oscillator for bull/bear cycles. We look at it here as one of our recently released Community
Workbench charts
.
Lower RVT values
mean transfer volume USD, and thus network usage, is growing relative to Realized Cap (the network's on-chain cost basis). This can be interpreted as a bullish signal.
Higher RVT values
means that network transfer volume is lower in relation to Bitcoin's realized value (Realized Cap), suggesting that network valuation is outpacing its demand utility. This is typically a bearish signal.
The RVT Ratio is currently trading at relatively historic lows, which indicates that the transaction volume throughput of the network is quite high relative to the value 'stored' in Bitcoin, and is a macro bullish signal.
Live chart
Supply dynamics are frequently a leading indicator of shifting HODLer sentiment. As prices pushes to new highs, older coins come back to life, seeking exit liquidity to realize profits. The Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB), filtered below to show only spent coins older than 1-month, have ticked up recently into bullish territory (>6% of daily volume). This follows a September which saw some of the quietest activity for this cohort in recent history (<2% of daily volume).
Live chart
To corroborate the increased daily spent volume of coins older than 1-month, we look to Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL)‚Äî the average age of all spent outputs over time, ignoring volume. Likewise to the bullish spike in SVAB we just mentioned, ASOL has seen an uptick over the 40-day average line, which typically aligns with price volatility in either direction.
Live chart
When combining the observations of increased old coin activity with the muted levels of profit-taking covered earlier, a bullish on-chain portrait is being painted. If Bitcoin can maintain an environment of low selling, price may find itself back in price discovery before long.

As the Bitcoin price coils into what appears to be a very tight bull flag, the on-chain market continues to show strength in supply dynamics, whilst on-chain activity remains well below bull market highs.
Long-Term Holders have distributed a very small fraction of their holdings, as is typically observed in all prior cycles. However, despite hovering just below ATHs, on-chain activity remains only marginally above bear market levels. Additionally, exchange balances continue to deplete, and miner hashrate and USD revenue are approaching new highs.
This combination of strong supply dynamics, mining network recovery, and relatively low network activity points to a fairly constructive outlook for Bitcoin over the coming weeks.

Assessing Supply Side Dynamics
Onchain analysis provides us with a view over the movement of coins between investor, exchange, and other entity wallets. Generally speaking, we use a combination of coin lifespan (time since last spent), and heuristics to distinguish between experienced smart-money, and inexperienced new investors.
Typical behaviour as Bitcoin prices approach ATHs is that Long-Term Holders (LTHs) (experienced investors) begin their distribution. As Bitcoin pushed to the recent ATH of $66k, supply held by LTHs also reached 'Peak HODL'. This is the point in time where they collectively owned a local maxima of the entire coin supply, 81.5% in this case.
Since then, LTHs have spent 0.73% of the coin supply back into liquid circulation, providing an upper bound estimate for the degree of sell-side pressure sourced from this cohort.
Live Chart
This spending behaviour has even slowed down the Long-term Holder Net Position change metric, which has been in a large accumulation period since April this year. The rate of LTH accumulation reached over 400k BTC per month for around 5-months through to late-September, and has now returned to a neutral level. This indicates that over the last 30-days, LTH supply is flat on net, and an equivalent volume of coins are maturing into LTH status, as are being spent out of it.
Live Chart
We can see similar spending behaviour in the Spent Volume Age Bands, where the dominance of coins older than 1-month has risen to 6% of total on-chain volume. Note however that levels of 6% were commonplace throughout much of 2021, and especially in Q1 where it reached over 10% as the bull market powered higher.
This metric highlights that whilst older coins are increasingly on the move, the market appears to be absorbing the sell-side without issue. Note also that bull markets can often sustain this elevated sell-side pressure for some time before topping out.
Live Chart
To provide a quantitative estimate of the sell-side, we can look to the revived supply metric, tracking how many coins older than 1yr are coming back into liquid circulation. Generally speaking, investors who have weathered Bitcoin volatility for 12mths, are quite likely to have a reasonable gauge of market risk, and what is considered expensive vs cheap coins.
What we can see is that around 6.5k BTC are being revived on a daily basis at present. What is also apparent is that this is a relatively low level compared to the 2017, 2019 and 2021 bull runs where over 20k BTC were revived per day. In fact the current levels of revived supply are similar to the spending patterns throughout late 2019 to 2020 which are mostly considered a late stage bear market.
Live Chart
To further drive home how relatively light the current spending is, we can review the HODL waves, filtered for coins younger than 3mths. This metric will trend higher when older coins, held by experienced investors are distributed and sold.
By definition, given the coin supply younger than 3mths is at an all-time-low of 15%, this means that coins older than 3mths are at an all-time-high of 85% of supply. Over 85% of the coin supply has remained dormant since August 2021. Investors are just not spending their coins.
The above supply dynamics paint a compelling picture of Long-term Holders hanging onto onto the vast majority of their stack. Current spending appears to be closer to taking strategic profits, rather than a market wide exit due to a belief that these prices are expensive.
Live Chart
Assessing Demand Dynamics
The demand dynamics in a bull market tend to come in two phases:
Smart money accumulation (pre-ATH)
, where on-chain activity is low, supply dynamics remain constructive, and most spending looks like strategic profits being taken.
Hype and euphoria (post-ATH)
, as media coverage of the asset increases, retail trader interest rises, and on-chain activity starts to climb. Older, more experienced hands generally increase their distribution from this point onwards.
Both the sell-side supply dynamics described above, and the demand dynamics that follow, both speak strongly to current market characteristics still being of the first phase:
smart money accumulation
, albeit closer to the transition out of this phase.
The first evidence of this is exchange net flows, which continue to demonstrate a remarkable dominance of outflows. Outflows have accelerated this week, reaching over 5k BTC in net withdrawals on a daily basis.
Live Chart
As a result of continued exchange outflows, the aggregate BTC exchange balance has fallen to multi-year lows of 12.9% of circulating supply. Even as Bitcoin consolidates below ATHs, exchange reserves continue to deplete.
Live Chart
Meanwhile, on-chain activity is recovering, albeit very slowly, and certainly far below historical examples of
Hype and Euphoria
as in 2017 and Q1 2021. Transaction counts remain well below the peaks seen in the first half of 2021, currently around 225k transactions/day. This is coincident with levels seen throughout the 2019-20 bear market.
Live Chart
A very similar pattern can be seen in the number of new on-chain entities observable in the onchain transaction space. A very modest uptrend is in play with new entities hitting 110k per day. Again, this is barely above levels sustained throughout the 2019-20 bear market, where activity was between 90k and 110k new entities per day.
This observation of prices near ATHs, whilst on-chain activity is near bear market lows is quite a remarkable divergence. It speaks to a convincing case where the market is likely still in the quiet accumulation phase, punctuated by low activity, large exchange outflows, and very modest strategic spending by experienced holders.
Live Chart
Weekly Feature: Mining Market Recovery
The mining industry continues to recover after the extraordinary event of 52% of the hash-power network dropping offline, almost overnight. On a 7-day MA basis, hash-rate declined from 176 EH/s to 84EH/s during the second half of May.
This decline of 92 EH/s was equivalent to the entire hash-power of the network up to October 2019. Since the low in early June, hash-rate has recovered by 95% to reach 164 EH/s. Given the current recovery trend, the mining market hash-rate could very well reach new ATHs before the end of 2021.
Live Chart
Miner revenues denominated in BTC are well know to decline dramatically every four years, as the block subsidy component is programatically halved. With transaction fees included, the current aggregate miner revenue fluctuates between 900 and 1,000 BTC per day.
There remains an ongoing debate regarding whether these halving events are likely to adversely affect protocol security long term. We won't analyse this fully here, but the following charts offer some commentary on the current trend and state of play.
Live Chart
Whilst miner incomes are denominated in BTC, their incurred costs of hardware, logistics, power and financing are denominated in fiat currency. Whilst the block subsidy is indeed at the lowest level in history, miner revenues in fiat currency are anything but.
Since the halving event in May 2020, USD aggregate revenues are up over 550%, rising from $9.3M/day to over $60M/day. In fact daily revenue is almost at all-time highs, off by just 5% from the peak of $67M/day set in May. This means the mining industry is being paid almost at the highest level in history for their services.
Live Chart
One approach to assess the total aggregate investment into the Bitcoin mining industry is via the Thermocap, a metric that calculates a cumulative sum of all USD value block rewards since genesis. The assumption is that miners are rational, profit motivated actors, and will thus invest up to $99.99 to win a reward of $100.
The Bitcoin Thermocap is technically always at ATH, but its growth has accelerated alongside rising price lately to reach $32.8B. In the approx 18mths since the May 2020 halving, the Thermocap has grown by 93%, up a total of $15.8B. In other words, 93% of all USD denominated security budget has been issued in the last 18mths, even after the latest halving event.
With Bitcoin hash-rate almost fully recovered from a 52% decline, miner USD revenues near ATHs, and 93% of the security budget issued in the last 1.5yrs, the Bitcoin security and incentives system appears to be functioning exceptionally well.
Such a simple protocol design, with simply extraordinary results.

Spending Inflection Point
In last weeks newsletter
, we described two typical phases of a bull market, and how market structure transitions from smart money accumulation, into distribution.
One of the most powerful on-chain tools to track this inflection point is the concept of lifespan, measured by coin-days destroyed (CDD). Each unit of BTC accumulates one coin-day, per day (i.e. 0.5BTC accumulates half a coin-day per day). When the coin is spent, the accumulated lifespan is destroyed, reset to zero, and begins re-accumulating again.
When old coins with large accumulated lifespans are spent, it will destroy a greater number of coin-days, and is often associated with long-term investors exiting positions. Bull markets can usually absorb many months of this distribution, but as selling continues, the probability of establishing a local or global top increases.
The chart below shows the 30d moving average of CDD, and demonstrates the transition from heavy accumulation in July to Nov, into a recent uptrend, signifying increased spending. Note also how the magnitude of CDD in H1 2021 was significantly higher, and was sustained for months. This highlights how an abundance of demand through a bull is capable of soaking up newly distributed supply.
Live Chart
Binary CDD, with a 7-day moving average applied, shows these trends in a more responsive format. This metric will trend higher when CDD is higher than the long term average for extended periods. We can see that whilst it is currently elevated, Binary CDD is barely above a value of 0.2, which has parallels to Sept-Nov 2020 before the primary bullish impulse. Spending of older coins is happening, although remains small in relative magnitude.
Live Chart
On a macro scale, we look to Liveliness which takes the ratio between cumulative coin-day destruction, and cumulative coin-day creation. The simple interpretation is:
Liveliness trends lower
when more coin dormancy and HODLing is in play.
Liveliness trends higher
when more coin-day destruction and spending is in play.
Steeper curves
mean greater HODLing/Distribution as appropriate.
Here we can see that after 6-months of HODLing (downtrend, green), Liveliness has plateaued and started a very slight uptrend. Similar to CDD and Binary CDD, this uptrend is only just being established, and far shallower than was seen in H1 2021. It again speaks to this inflection point in spending behaviour by older hands.
Live Chart
A new metric introduced to Workbench as a pre-set this week is
Binary Liveliness
. Borrowing concepts from Binary CDD, this metric establishes a similar oscillator to identify trends of accumulation (0) and distribution (1) using two methods:
Green
: When Liveliness is higher than the 30DMA, return 1, else return 0.
Blue
: When Liveliness is higher than the prior day, return 1, else return 0 (with a 7-day moving average applied)
Again, we can observe an uptick over recent weeks confirming an appreciable increase in coin-day destruction. However, like our previous charts, it remains modest in magnitude. If the next phase of the bull market is indeed in place, this metric can be expected to reach and maintain higher levels for weeks to months.
Live Chart
Estimating Capital Inflows
We have established that spending behaviour by more experienced investors has increased of late. The next step is to estimate the magnitude of sell-side pressure, and thus the capital inflows needed to absorb it. Whilst a large amount of trading occurs off-chain on spot and derivatives exchanges, we can layer in on-chain datasets to establish a lower-bound of capital inflows and outflows to the network.
One of the most intuitive examples of this is the Realised Cap (entity-adjusted in this case to filter out internal transfers). This metric values every coin in the supply at the price it last moved on-chain, reflecting the accumulation of net realised profits minus losses. Each time a coin is moved at a profit it will add value to the realised cap. Conversely, realised losses will subtract from it, reflecting capital outflows.
The Realised Cap has resumed an uptrend and reached an ATH of $450B, as coins are distributed, and revalued higher. This represents a net capital inflow of $50B since the previous peak in May, set during the sell-off.
Live Chart
On a daily basis, the total value of coins sold at either a profit or a loss require a buyer with capital to absorb it. The chart below shows that Between $1.5B and $2.1B in total value daily is being realised by spent coins this month. Given price has largely consolidated sideways through November, we can thus estimate this as a lower bound for total capital inflow into Bitcoin.
Live Chart
On a relative basis, we can then compare this total realised value to the Market Cap or the Realised Cap to normalise by market size. This establishes a simple oscillator for total capital inflow vs network valuation.
Previous market tops (namely 2017 and 2021) occurred when total value realised by spending exceeded 0.3% of the market cap, and 1.0% of the Realised Cap (often reaching much higher). In the current market, spending accounts for less than 50% of these thresholds. This provides additional evidence that a healthy bull market demand should be capable of absorbing significantly more coin distribution.
Live Chart
Finding Market Tops
Identifying Bitcoin market tops is no easy feat. However, with over a decade of on-chain and market data at our disposal, we can use tools to identify behaviours and cyclical patterns that signalled market tops in the past.
The first tool is the Mayer Multiple, calculated as a simple yet effective ratio between price, and the 200DMA. Using statistical methods, we can establish that a Mayer Multiple value of 2.4 reflects an unlikely extreme, where price has rallied to 2.4x the long-term, and well observed 200DMA. This provides an upper pricing band, currently sitting at $110k, although it will trend higher (or lower) as the 200DMA price changes.
Live Chart
The Top Price model was originally created by Willy Woo and is an empirically fitted model, multiplying the all time Average price ($6.1k) by a factor of 35. This gives a current cycle top value of $214k. Note that the all-time-average price is much slower to change than the 200DMA, and thus the Top Price will be a less volatile top model.
Live Chart
Next is the battle tested MVRV Z-Score metric. Using statistical normalisation, this metric measures how many standard deviations the spot price is away from the realised price.
Another way to think about this metric is that very high values mean the market is holding large unrealised profits, and thus the incentive to sell is at a maximum. Conversely, bottoms can be found when the market is heavily underwater and investor capitulation is most likely underway. The current market is around 'half-way', after cooling off dramatically following the peak in April.
Live Chart
As bull markets progress, older hands continue to sell, and newer, less experienced buyers absorb the supply. Market bottoms are established when the smart money buys and HODLs a maximum of supply, and conversely, tops occur when large coin volumes have has transferred to mostly weak hand speculators.
The RHODL ratio captures this phenomena by taking the ratio between 1-week and 1-year old Realised Cap HODL wave bands. Simply put, it will peak when the number of very young coins is high relative to older coins. RHODL is consolidating at the moment, strangely similar to 2013, which suggests a stable equilibrium between 1-wk and 1-yr old coins.
Live Chart
Lastly we have the Reserve Risk metric, a tool that is packed full of on-chain wisdom. It can be considered as follows:
Higher prices increase the incentive to sell.
Every day a HODLer chooses not to sell, they sacrifice opportunity cost, with the expectation that prices will be higher in the future.
When more HODLers choose not to sell, fewer coin-days are destroyed, and Reserve Risk will trend lower.
As prices rise, more HODLers will eventually reach their target sell price. As a result, more coins are sold, opportunity cost is realised, and Reserve Risk will trend higher and peak at blow-off tops.
Given the remarkable accumulation that occurred over the last 6-months, Reserve Risk is impressively low at the moment. However recently elevated CDD is starting to resume the uptrend, although with plenty of gas left in the tank.

While price stays pinned below new highs and sentiment remains scattered, Bitcoin's stakeholders are actively adjusting to new market information.
This has shown up as a recent shifting of coin distribution amongst holders, which will likely impact the market's short-term response. This weeks newsletter will assess the balance in both the macro and micro changes in on-chain sentiment and coin holdings following this week's price volatility. Our analysis will address:
The sharp move lower in price,
the aftermath of overhead / unprofitable supply associated with it, and holders' spending behavior in response to volatility.
The ""big picture"" market trends in play,
which will aim to provide context on where things stand and considerations moving forward.

Assessing Momentum, Supply & Spending
Last week's newsletter
established the following:
Realized Profits have been increasing
, and elevated since reaching $60k+.
Realized Losses have been flat for weeks
, a natural byproduct of upwards trending price action.
As function of the two previous points,
the Realized Cap has broken to new highs
, establishing a higher plateau for the network-wide cost basis.
Generally speaking, spikes in on-chain profit-taking during bullish impulses are to be expected as price climbs to new highs, and are typical for any bull market. As the realisation of profits increase, so too does the probability of establishing a macro top.
As such, an increase in Realized Profits and Realized Cap generally indicates that:
Increased realization of profits is an estimate of sell pressure
, which needs to be absorbed by an increasing inflow of demand in order to maintain sideways, or upwards price momentum.
The buyers of these coins (i.e. Short Term Holders) have an elevated cost-basis
, making them more sensitive to shorter term moves in price.
Live Chart
The combination of these factors can cause a stall in market momentum, and establish a local top. One tool to identify this shift in momentum is the 28-day Market-Realised Gradient. This metric was recently released to Workbench as a pre-set, and measures the relative change in momentum between speculative value (price), and true organic capital inflows (realised price). Interpretation of the chart is as follows:
Positive Delta Gradient:
uptrend is in play for time period in consideration.
Negative Delta Gradient:
downtrend is in play for time period in consideration.
Increasing Delta Gradient:
Momentum is to the upside as capital flows can support price (trend continuation).
Decreasing Delta Gradient:
Momentum is to the downside as capital flows cannot support price (bearish divergence).
Prior to the price drop this week, the 28-day Market Realised Gradient displayed fading momentum with a sideways price. This same signature occurred before the steep price drop in May, and the initial rejection from $50k in September. As price made higher highs, the momentum behind each one was declining creating a bearish divergence.
Live Chart
As the market sell-off, the Percent Supply in Profit metric, can provide insight into the profitability and cost basis of market participants and the coin supply. Takeaways include:
15% of the Bitcoin supply
has an on-chain cost basis greater than $57k.
This is a relatively top heavy distribution among Bitcoin holders
, which can be identified by comparing previous periods where Percent Supply in Profit was at 85%-90%.
Price currently sits in the bull / bear transition zone between 85%-90%
. 15% of supply underwater has historically been sufficient to create reflexive downside if price cannot reclaim higher levels in a reasonable timeframe.
Live Chart
UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows at which prices the current set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created, i.e. each bar shows the amount of existing BTC that last moved within that specified price bucket. There are various clusters of coins from key levels throughout 2021, with the largest being the 1.9 Million BTC moved between $60k and $68k. This overhead supply could provide resistance in the coming weeks should underwater holders look to cut their losses.
Live Chart
Short term holders (STH) are most responsive to price action due to a combination of having a higher relative cost-basis, a higher time preference, and potentially a lower degree of conviction in the asset. This week's price action was no exception, as STHs played a role in setting both the highs and the lows:
STH-SOPR spiked to 1.1 near the highs of the week
, a historically high value and one that is associated with large amounts of profit-taking.
STH-SOPR dipped below 1 near the lows of the week
, a value that has historically bounced price during bull runs as STHs cost-basis gets tested and top buyers capitulate.
STH-SOPR remaining below 1 for an extended period of time
would be a signal to market participants to take caution, and increase probabilities of an extended downside.
STH-SOPR values on the macro scale remain relatively flat compared to the early 2021 price run up
, possibly signalling that the market hasn't become overly saturated with profit-taking yet. This is a more constructive medium term observation.
Live Chart
Zooming Out: Recovery Considerations
We've established that price drew down, and that STHs actively participated in both sides of the action by taking large profits at the highs, and spending at break even near the lows.
Now we will look at the performance of STH holdings via STH MVRV Ratio and STH Realized Price. Similar to STH SOPR, these metrics have historically been high signal means for gauging market conditions and sentiment, by tracking price versus the cost basis of STHs. Application of these metrics provide the following information:
STH MVRV values = 1 represent a typical bull / bear line in the sand.
It indicates price has returned to the STH on-chain cost basis, and they typically aim to defend that level in bull markets. Conversely, in a bear market, STHs will generally offload coins at their break even price, forming resistance.
STH Realized Price is currently at $53k
, signalling any moves near that level will likely be a battle ground to reestablish bull dominance should price trade down for another leg. Should $53k be lost, it would signal a potential need for caution as the probabilities of a 'top heavy' market creating more sell-side are likely to have increased.
Live Chart
Spent Volume Age Bands identify the age of coins dominating the on-chain flows on any given day. This can help analysts determine when and where long term holders (i.e. those with the most conviction) are spending their BTC. While this tool doesn't necessarily provide precision for finding tops / bottoms in price, it demonstrates when the process of profit-taking or accumulation begins. It can also be used to track sentiment of various cohorts of investors.
With late 2020 / early 2021 as a case study, consistent spending of coins aged greater than 1 month (> 5% of daily BTC onchain volume) began November 2020, and ended in April-May 2021. Since bottoming around $30k, Bitcoin has had one SVAB spike at $40k in August, and another above $60k in October.
Since then, SVAB values have reverted back to 2.5% of daily volume, suggesting older coins are increasingly dormant, especially as prices pull-back. This can reasonably be interpreted as
longer term holders reducing their spending, and thus are more likely to be adding to positions, not exiting them.
Live Chart
This trend of long term holder (LTH) HODLing can also be seen in the supply dynamics. The total supply held by STHs can only increase in three instances:
When new coins being mined (which have zero coin days accumulated),
When coins are withdrawn from exchanges, or
When LTHs spend their holdings.
The chart below shows that total supply held by STHs is at multi-year lows (<3 Million BTC), which means LTH supply is at multi-year highs by contrast. Low STH supply is typical at the end of bear markets and in early bull markets, usually following long periods of accumulation. Seeing STH supply this low whilst price is near ATHs is a relatively unique case.

Bitcoin's price opened at a high of $59,339, and reached the lowest price for the month of $53,569. This continues the price correction that has been in play for most of November.
With Bitcoin now over 20% below the all-time-high, headlines in traditional media have
declared that Bitcoin has entered a bear market
. However it may surprise some readers that this current market correction is actually the least severe in 2021. Some might even say business as usual for a Bitcoin HODLer.
Sell-offs in Jan, Feb and April all reached drawdowns as deep as -24.2% from the ATH before reverting. The deepest drawdown this year was obviously the period from May to July, where the market reached a -54% drawdown at the lows. The most recent correction in September was actually the second deepest, reaching -37.2% from April's ATH, and 25.2% off the local high of $53k.
Live Chart
In this week's newsletter, we will be assessing the market structure during this drawdown from three different angles to identify investor sentiment across cohorts, and potential risks for further downside. We will focus on:
Derivatives markets
and the state of leverage in the system.
Short-Term Holders
and the recent retest of their onchain cost basis.
Long-Term Holders
and the state of their distribution and profitability.

CME Futures Dominance Climbs
It is important to pay attention to the state of Bitcoin derivatives markets, as they can often be a source of excessive leverage which can unwind in a fairly spectacularly way from time to time.
In options markets, we continue to see between $12B and $14B in nominal open interest throughout October and November. The total open interest has come off the highs this week, down to approximately $10 Billion following the expiry of the 26-November contracts.
Live Chart
Futures open interest is also just below all-time-highs when denominated in BTC, reaching just above 400k BTC in total nominal value. Denominating in BTC is used to remove the influence of coin price on this metric (such as coin-margined contracts), and aide in identifying periods of rapidly growing leverage, or de-leveraging.
Highlighted in the chart below are a number of short and long squeezes, where open interest rapidly decreased as price volatility forced traders to cover their positions. With leverage in futures markets near an ATH, there is a risk that leverage may unwind, as has been demonstrated in almost all prior instances where open interest surpassed 350k BTC in size.
Live Chart
However, for all futures positions, buyers are matched equally with sellers, meaning there is limited information on likely market direction in the event of a leverage squeeze. Perpetual futures funding rates can give some insight into the market's directional bias, and at the time of writing, remains slightly positive (bullish bias). However it is notable that funding rates have generally declined alongside falling price, suggesting traders are more cautious as the correction proceeds.
However, whilst funding is positive, the decline is quite significant, which doesn't rule out the possibility that a large portion of the market is net short as price declines. It is reasonably plausible for a leverage squeeze to play out in either direction given this observation.
Live Chart
On a more specific note, since the launch of the Bitcoin futures backed ETFs in the US markets, the dominance of both open interest (pink), and futures trade volume (blue) on the CME has exploded higher.
The chart below shows that contracts opened on the CME market now represents over 19.3% of all futures open interest, an almost doubling from the 10% dominance in early-September. Similarly, trade volume on the CME has risen from just 1.4%, to 6.0% over the same period.
Live Workbench Chart
Short-Term Holder Analysis
In the last two weeks newsletters (
46
and
47
) we focused on a number of metrics related to Short-Term Holders, whose coins are younger than ~155-days. We also noted that the Realised Price of the Short-Term Holder cohort was hovering at around $53k, and would likely provide market support.
This week, price traded to a low of $53.5k, which whilst not a technical touch, does suggest a potential front-running of that psychological cost basis support level was in play. This is now the second retest of the STH Realised Price in the current trend, and if held, has similarities to major corrections observed in 2017, where it acted as reliable support.
Live Workbench Chart
A common onchain behaviour we see near the lows of bull market corrections are top buyers capitulating and realising losses. In many ways, bottoms cannot be hammered out until these potential sellers are exhausted.
Looking to overall realised profits and losses, we can see two recent events in play:
Realised Profits (green)
have declined alongside the correction, potentially signalling reducing profit taking, and growing investor conviction.
Realised Losses spiked (pink)
to $800M per day, similar to significant sell-offs in April, and July, but much lower than the major sell-off in May. This suggests a reasonable flush out of spot top buyers has occurred, but does not rule out further sell-side.
Live Workbench Chart
Zooming into the STH cohort specifically, the STH Profit/Loss ratio has fallen just below 1 this week. This indicates that spending by STH are realising losses on net. Similar to the STH Realised Price, this represents a test of investor conviction as prices return to, or below their on-chain cost basis. Ideally, market strength needs to step in reasonably soon, else the probability of STHs selling at or around their cost basis will likely increase.
Live Chart
Now whilst price is testing STH conviction, and trading around their cost basis, the market is actually in a healthier position when compared to the September correction. The total proportion of supply held by STHs that is in profit has increased by 60%, from 5.78% of circulating supply in September, to 9.20% today. STH supply in loss has accordingly declined from 12.3% to 9.6% of circulating supply.
More STH supply is in profit, price is retesting their cost basis, and top buyers are realising losses on-chain. In bull market conditions, this combination usually sets out a fairly constructive short-term outlook. The key 'watch-it' is whether the market can convincingly hold the STH Realised Price at ~$53k.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holder Analysis
Shifting our focus to Long-Term Holders, we can see that there has been a reasonably continuous rate of spending over the last month. From the peak of 13.5M BTC in holdings, LTHs have spent (assumed distributed) 150k BTC, equivalent to around 5.8% of the volume accumulated since March 2021.
Live Chart
Performing a similar breakdown assessment as for STHs, we can see that the proportion of LTH supply in profit has also increased since the September lows. Whilst LTH supply in profits has increased from 72.3% to 75.8% of circulating supply, the proportion at a loss has fallen from 9.65% to 5.80%.
In comparison to the correction in September, the balance of supply in profit vs loss is actually much healthier, both for STHs and LTHs. Whilst the risk of further downside certainly remains, forced selling in the mid-50k's by investors holding too much underwater supply is unlikely to be the cause.
Live Chart
So now that we have established LTHs are spending some of their holdings, we can look to the LTH-SOPR to assess the relative profitability of the coins that are on the move. Marked on the chart below is the approximate time in late June where the STH-LTH threshold of 155-days is for context.
Here we can see that the LTH-SOPR metric is in a macro decline, indicating that since March, the profitability of LTH spent coins has been falling. Note also how this week especially, LTH-SOPR has fallen rapidly, again suggesting smaller profit multiples are being realised.
The most important observation is the divergence since August, where LTH-SOPR trades lower as prices trade higher. There are two primary factors behind this observation:
The LTH threshold now encompasses the first half of 2021 in which the market traded well above last cycles $20k ATH. LTH coins can simply now have a higher cost basis.
LTHs who are spending at the moment, are spending coins purchased closer to the current price. This could be interpreted as LTHs de-risking, panic selling closer to their cost basis, or selling coins with the lowest tax burden (highest cost basis).
Live Chart
Finally, we can use LTH-SOPR to divulge an estimate average 'spent coin cost-basis'. In other words, for all the LTH spent coins each day, what was the average price they we last moved at?
By taking the ratio of market price and LTH-SOPR, we can see that the 'LTH Spent Price' ticked up to $34.3k this week (green). Extreme peaks and troughs in this metric often occur around local market tops and bottoms, often an indicator of strategic profit taking (high profit multiples), or panic selling (lower profit multiples), respectively.
Live Workbench Chart
In summary this week, we have:
Market sentiment taking a hit, despite the drawdown from ATH actually being one of the least severe in 2021
Open interest leverage in options and futures at or near ATHs, which is cause for some concern regarding heightened 'flush out' potential. Funding rates suggest an only slightly positive bias, making both a long- or short- squeeze plausible scenarios.
Price has retested the Short-Term Holder onchain cost basis and bounced. Holding this level at $53k is key to support a bull market.
Long-Term Holders have distributed 5.8% of the supply accumulated since March and some uncertainty exists based on their spending patterns.
Both Long and Short-term Holders are holding more profitable supply than September's correction, which can generally be viewed as constructive for price.

This follows concerns about Federal Reserve tapering efforts, and the emergence of the Omicron virus variant, which has led to weakness across both Bitcoin and traditional markets.

Bitcoin opened the week at $54,815 and rallied to a high of $59,041, before plummeting to a low of $45,032 on Saturday. At the lows, this puts the market down -34.5% from the all-time high set on November 9.

High Volume meets High Volatility
In last week's newsletter and video report, we covered the elevated risks posed by high open interest in Bitcoin futures markets, where sustained peak levels created the necessary fuel for a high volatility event. Legacy market weakness on Friday weighed on all assets globally, holding Bitcoin's price around $53K and near pivotal technical support.

When price failed to hold, sell pressure triggered a cascade of long liquidations. Within hours, Futures Open Interest had been flushed of $5.4 billion in contracts, a reduction if -24.5% in total value from the space.


Live Chart
The chain of contract closures on Saturday amounted to a total rinse of 58,202 BTC in value. In BTC denomination, this liquidation was the second largest single day change in Futures Open Interest in 2021, bested only by the historic sell-off on May 19 that totalled 79,244 BTC.

Other notable events this year include:

May 12 - The same day Tesla announced it would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for electric vehicles.
July 26 - A short squeeze helped propel the rally out of the summer lows.
September 7 - The same day El Salvador began to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.

Live Workbench Chart
The futures market is not the only derivatives space that has seen high volume and interest in recent weeks. Options activity tends to spike on days of sell-offs and rallies where hedge traders look to capture volatility premiums. Last week's flush saw the second highest hourly options volume since mid-May—  more than $1.7 billion per hour.

Additionally, Options Volume has increased more than >250% since July, now regularly settling over $1 billion daily.


Live Chart
Perpetual Futures Hit Reset Button
The Futures Perpetual Funding Rate represents the directional bias of leveraged positions, and helps to manage balance in the perpetual futures market.

When the funding rates are positive, long traders are paying a premium to shorts for the privilege of keeping their positions open. In periods of sustained bullish price, this can be the cost of doing business.
Likewise, when the funding rates are negative, shorts are paying longs as a majority bear bias dominates futures.
When aggressive cascades of closures are ignited, the force of liquidations can push aggregate funding across the median line and in the opposite direction, which occurred on Saturday. After $5.4 billion in Open Interest was flushed, the Perpetual Funding Rate plummeted to -0.035%, demonstrating a complete reset of the funding bias.

The reset of funding represents the first negative aggregate rate since late September, and the deepest discount since the previous sustained negative regime in July.


Live Chart
Since the last funding reset, the perpetual market had maintained a premium regime for over two months. Confidence among traders can oscillate over time, and monitoring the trend of Long Liquidations Dominance can provide insights into the cyclical shifts in speculator sentiment.

As price rose out of the July lows, the existing short bias from summer carried into the rally. Short liquidations dominated futures for weeks as biases were tested, and it wasn't until early October when the trend began to reverse.

Confidence had fully shifted hands by late October, and a consistent premium regime led the market while long traders felt the pain of liquidations. These cyclical trends are part of the natural oscillation of markets.


Live Chart
Whenever price creates new highs, there are invariably traders who buy the top. These new investors are the first group tested by the next period of uncertainty, and nothing spells uncertainty like a flash sell-off in futures.

With cascading liquidations come spenders in loss, and last week's event set a recent high for Realized Losses on-chain. The sum of coins spent in loss for December 4 totalled $3 billion. Coming into Saturday, previous high marks were set on May 19 and June 25, with losses of $4.5B and $3.8B respectively.


Live Chart
HODLers Set the Floor
Now that we have assessed the derivatives space, we turn our eyes to the on-chain supply dynamics that illustrate HODLer behavior. The various cohorts of Bitcoin supply that comprise the HODLer class are the inertial bellwethers we use for determining macro market direction, and (assumed) smart-money sentiment.

The HODL Waves visualize the entirety of Bitcoin's supply divvied up by the age of coins. The interpretation is as follows:

Newly spent coins have lifespans of zero, and they appear in the younger bands (warmer colors) at the bottom to begin aging.
As coins lay dormant and mature, they graduate into older, higher cohorts (cooler colors).
When filtered to show coins younger than 3 months, we see that only 2.63% of older coin supply has been distributed into this group since October 27. That means that over 97% of the supply older than 3 months has remained unspent since the recent all-time high and pullback. HODLers of older coins are not spending them, by and large.


Live Chart
To add depth to this perspective, we look at Dormancy. Dormancy measures the average age of transactions (in days) on-chain per unit of BTC spent. It is similar to the Average Spent Output Lifespan, but with a volume weighting.

Rising Dormancy means older coins are being spent at higher volumes.
Declining Dormancy indicates a reduction in older coin spending volume.
The average baseline level for 2020 was a Dormancy level of 40 days, and we are well below that value now, sitting at an average of 25 days. In fact, Dormancy has been in a macro decline since the height of the bull run in January. The implication is that HODLer cohorts are exhibiting steady maturation behavior, and activity on-chain is dominated by younger coins.

Generally speaking, this demonstrates high conviction, despite extreme volatility and losses. Quite the contrast to this week's price action.


Live Chart
Knowing that older coins continue to sit dormant, we can look at exchanges to determine how much activity may be occurring there, and corroborate our theory of a lack of distribution.

Exchange Fee Dominance looks at total exchange activity as a percentage of on-chain fees each day. High activity can be interpreted as characteristic of elevated interest or urgency for holders.

When this value is high or rising, exchanges are producing elevated settlement activity on-chain, as seen in late 2020 and into spring 2021 during the bull run.
Flat or declining activity means that exchanges are experiencing a reduction in settlement on-chain, and could be seeing quieter activity overall as interest wanes or investors calm down.
The observation to make about Exchange Fee Dominance is the precipitous decline since the recent all-time high. Exchange fees are now at their lowest share of on-chain settlement activity since October 2020.


Live Chart
The balance of BTC on exchanges is a metric worth monitoring in periods of volatility, as it marks the primary barrier to exit for holders: placing coins on an exchange for sale.

We observe the flow of coins to/from exchanges here by looking at Exchange Net Transfer Volume. During the capitulation in May, exchanges saw a notable and sustained uptick of BTC inflows, with periods of 10.4k and 13.9k net BTC deposits. This contrasts with the present moment, where recent peak exchange inflows are a fraction of the size, at 2k and 3.2k BTC. Bitcoin holders aren't behaving as they have in prior moments of weakness, hinting at an underlying confidence, and largely confirming weakness was more heavily influenced by derivative markets rather than spot selling.


Live Chart
So if older coins are not being spent in notable size, and exchanges are not seeing elevated activity, then where are spent coins coming from?

They're coming from Short Term Holders— investors who bought in the past few months, most of whom are spending at a loss.

Short-Term Holder SOPR shows the profitability of coins spent by Short-Term Holders. The chart below is interpreted as:

Higher value prints indicate profit taking by coins spent from lower prices.
Bounces against a value of 1 are tests of holders' cost basis.
Prints below 1 indicate coins being spent in loss.
Short-Term Holder SOPR printed its lowest value since late July, which shows the hallmark signature of a capitulation by newer investors. For Short-Term Holders to be realizing losses here means they had to buy their coins at the recent tops, and are already spending them to new hands. This group appears to be the only cohort reacting significantly to the events of last week. More mature HODLers remain unmoved.


Live Chart
Through our observations of the data, last week's sell-off was driven by liquidations in the futures market, and the various on-chain cohorts that make up Bitcoin's supply remain largely unfazed. Those who are spending coins appear to be predominantly those who bought the top, and they are realizing losses and capitulating.

High levels of leverage followed by price volatility is a classic recipe for a correction, and capitulative moments like Bitcoin just experienced are unfortunately needed for markets to return to a healthy equilibrium. The key question we will seek to answer in the coming weeks, is whether market sentiment has taken a severe enough hit that the underlying conviction seen this week deteriorates, or does it hold on."

deleveraging event last week
. Bitcoin prices were largely range-bound, opening at $49,368, and trading between a high of $51,900, and a low of $46,942.
After significant market volatility like last week's deleveraging event, it's valuable to assess the broad investor response, changes in spending patterns and sentiment, and new emergent trends that are observable in on-chain and derivative data. To achieve this goal, this week's newsletter will make comparisons between the recent deleveraging, and the market structure experienced through May to July.
Discussion of the points above will aim to provide context to the current state of Bitcoin markets, and where we are within the Bitcoin accumulation and distribution game.

Realization of Profits and Loss
After large price drawdowns it's natural for some holders to Realize Losses, out of fear that the market is due for further downside, or in capitulation as well below the holder's cost basis.
We're currently observing an acceleration of Realized Losses among holders, trending above
$1 Billion
daily on two occasions during this correction. While Realized Losses only directly show underwater supply being
spent,
we typically assume this reflects an upper bound magnitude on new sell pressure, as coins enter back into liquid circulation.
If we compare the current deleveraging to the one in May, we can see:
May-July 2021 drawdown
shows a deceleration in Realized Losses after the initial capitulation event, as top buyers transferred coins to exchanges for sale.
Oct-Dec 2021 drawdown
shows an acceleration in Realized Losses indicating a more trigger friendly, and cautious approach by the market, potentially indicative of nervousness of further downside.
Live Chart
However a key difference between these two events can be seen in Exchange Net Flows and the impact on overall exchange balances. In May-July, exchanges saw an enormous influx of some +168k BTC on net over a span of three months. In the current Oct-Dec correction, we have seen a total of 49k BTC flow out of exchanges, making for quite the contrast.
Live Chart
Looking to exchange Net Flow Volumes (on a 7D EMA basis), we can see that the current market is firmly in a regime of net outflows, with 3k to 5k BTC in daily outflows common. Overall, whilst significant losses are most certainly being realized on-chain, they are being met with a significant, and arguably overwhelming demand.
Live Chart
We can also look to market momentum using the 28-day Market Realised Gradient (MRG). This tool measures the relative momentum between price action (Market Cap) and capital flows onchain (Realized Cap). High or descending values have historically provided a signal to take caution, and low or ascending values have historically provided a signal for a more risk-on approach.
Current MRG values display Bitcoin as being in an oversold state, with historically low MRG values. However, the metric has yet to fully level out and plateau, indicating that price and capital flows are both still attempting to reestablish a healthy equilibrium. Early confirmation would be found on a technical break higher, and full confirmation with a break back above the zero bound.
Live Chart
The other side of the onchain equation are investors realizing profits, whom are most often longer-term holders. The magnitude of Realized Profits is in a similar decline to that seen in the first half of 2021 suggesting that fewer profitable coins are spent as the correction proceeds. This is partly due to lower prices, but also signals that in-profit holders are not as interested in spending at current levels.
However, declining realized profits in Jan-May occurred alongside a topping price pattern, suggesting weaker demand as time moved on. Declining realized profits during a correction, as seen in May-July, and at present, likely indicate a returning conviction, and reducing desire to divest at these prices.
A significant return to elevated values in this metric, especially if accompanied by price weakness would be cause for concern however, as it would likely indicate deteriorating conviction among the in-profit cohort, and a fear of further downside.
Live Chart
The Aftermath of Deleveraging
As the Bitcoin market matures, derivative products have become an increasingly relevant influence on price action. Following a deleveraging event, it is also important to assess whether the market is adding more leverage, as traders 'long the dip', or whether the market remains cautious in response to the volatility.
This influence of futures markets on price is particularly dominant during periods where Futures Open Interest climbs above the 380k BTC level. It becomes particularly concerning after a strong price run up and the extended period of Realized Profit prints we observed earlier as:
Strong hands and traders transfer coins to newer holders, whom have a higher cost basis and are more sensitive to volatility.
High Futures Open Interest provides fuel for a volatile, futures-driven move.
These factors were both prevalent in the May and November tops, which resulted in a cleansing of Futures Open Interest back to ~340k BTC. Note however that Open Interest has climbed by around 5k BTC over the last week. A key metric to watch from here on is whether open interest starts to climb aggressively This would indicate a higher chance that liquidation levels and stop-losses are clustering around the current trading range, and increased expectations of derivative led volatility.
Live Chart
Perpetual futures funding rates are a core data-point for assessing the markets directional bias. Funding Rates help peg the price of these futures as closely to the spot Bitcoin price as possible by:
Making longs pay shorts (green) when
Perpetual Futures price > spot price
Making shorts pay longs (red) when
spot price > Perpetual Futures price
Extreme values in Funding Rates have historically signaled peak euphoria, or misery for market participants, often correlating with local market highs and lows, respectively. Before the drawdown last week, we witnessed a local euphoria, evident in the large relative spike in Funding Rates, almost precisely at the market ATH. At the lows of the week, we experienced the opposite, with the first negative print since the $40k lows in October.
While some of this is due to the deleveraging event that took place, two things are worth considering:
Leveraged traders were forced to close their positions, clearing out stop-losses and liquidation levels down to $45k (and even lower on some exchanges).
Funding rates are only slightly positive at present, and are not climbing significantly. This adds further evidence that a large majority of 'excessive' leverage has been cleared from the market. Similar to Open Interest, this is a metric worth keeping an eye on.
Live Chart
Futures Volume also spiked during the event, which has historically provided notable pivot points in price action. On the most recent impulse Futures Volume in aggregate was ~2 Million BTC.
While this sum in Futures Volume is significant, it remains relatively small compared to both the May and September 2021 drawdowns. Furthermore, it is part of a consistent decline in overall volume that has been established since May.
This seems counter-intuitive as price has more than doubled to ATHs since then, and price increases would seem like an appropriate pairing with increased trading volumes. Note also that volumes are also down on a USD basis versus early 2021, so it's not a function of higher prices equating to less BTC traded.
This change could therefore be a combination of:
Futures traders having a lower risk appetite after the historic May 2021 drawdown.
Traders taking their funds to other markets such as altcoins.
A view the Bitcoin markets are still in fact in a longer term macro consolidation, digesting the appreciation, volatility and rapidly changing global events since this time last year.
Live Chart
After a deleveraging event, it is typical that spot markets (and thus on-chain data) return as the dominant forcing function for dictating price movements. A useful tool for identifying this transition between derivative led and spot/onchain led market structure is to look at Perpetual Futures Open Interest as a proportion of the Bitcoin Market Cap:
High values (>1.3%) signal derivatives dominance
Low values (<1.1%) signal spot dominance
While these values have not reverted to historically low levels such as those seen in May, they've returned to much healthier levels, previously seen throughout the late 2021 move from $30k to $60k+. This further supports that a meaningful deleveraging event has occurred, and the market appears to be responding with caution, rather than levering up once again.
Live Chart
Finally, we will close out with investor profitability. We can use Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) as a gauge for when additional sell-side may be activated should Bitcoin prices languish, or decline further. The historical battleground for bulls and bears sits at a network-wide profitability of 50%, meaning half of the Bitcoin Market Cap is held as unrealized profit.
In bear trends
this zone provides resistance, as holders are increasingly willing to cut their positions at moderate profit, as can be seen in the May to July price action.
In bull trends
this zone provides support from holders looking add to their profitable positions, as can be seen through August to November.
Per this chart, the current leg down in price seems to resemble a correction within a larger bull trend - a stark contrast to May where NUPL sliced cleanly through the 50% level. However, the transition between this area marks the difference between Belief-denial (green coloration) and Optimism-Anxiety (yellow coloration), an appropriate description for current holder sentiment at present.
As the Bitcoin market consolidates, it appears that derivatives markets have taken more of a back-seat relative to spot markets, and a meaningful deleveraging event has occurred. There are signs conviction is returning to spot investors and demand remains significant, however the market still sits atop a key level of psychological support as seen in the NUPL metric. It is possible that this trading range is defining the bull-bear line in the sand, and a key risk is whether a possible transition into less favourable conditions occurs should it fail to hold.

Spent Coins Get Younger
A common behavior when prices make new highs is for profitable coins to be spent into market strength. Holders from lower prices want to pay themselves for the effort of waiting and taking on risk, and it results in profit taking and elevated activity from older coin cohorts.
The Spent Volume Age Bands, filtered below to display spent coins older than 6-months, illustrates what older spending volume can look like. In the late 2020 bull run, >6m coin spending comprised 7% of on-chain volume. Since then, successive peaks of spending from this group have declined, topping at just 3.5% of daily volume at the recent highs.
Live Chart
This dynamic is also visible in the Realized Cap HODL Waves, which divvy up the circulating supply by their respective weighting in the Realized Cap, helping to emphasize recent spending.
A key observation in the Realized Cap HODL Waves is the compression of the 3m-6m wave, which are owners of coins bought between mid June and September‚Äî essentially the year's lows. A squeezing of the 3m-6m band while the senior 6m-1y band bells outward shows coin maturation- as BTC lies dormant and accrues age, it graduates into the older cohort above.
In lockstep with the growing of the older 6m-1y group, is a rise in the youngest bands in October and November at the market all-time high. This behavior shows older coins being spent, which resets their lifespans to zero. Based on the squeeze of the 3m-6m band (and the 1m-3m band to a lesser degree), much of the recent spending emanated from these medium-term holders.
The take home message here is that much of the coin spending underway appears to be from coins purchased in the last 3m-6m, rather than longer-term holders.
Live Chart
Among the investors anticipated to take action at the recent highs were Long-Term Holders, who are consistent distributors in price discovery. The cyclical nature of Long-Term Holders is as follows:
Steady accumulation
in bearish market phases, eventually reaching a level of 'Peak HODL'.
Spending of profitable coins
at the all-time high, realizing profits into market strength.
By the time price peaks and rolls over, Long-Term Holders have begun
net accumulating
again.
Distribution events, visualized below as the 7-day change in Long-Term Holder Supply, typically result in peaks of 2% or more supply moved to new buyers. However the recent all-time highs and subsequent pullback have seen a peak spending rate of only 0.6%, just 30% of the expected amount from Long-Term Holders. These low time preference investors seem reticent to spend at current prices, which may speak to a sophistication in their decision making.
Live Workbench Chart
Short-Term Coins Play Musical Chairs
New investors are the first group tested by price weakness. In the days following the November all-time high and beyond the liquidation flush of December 4, loss realization on-chain of $50-$100M per day was common. For loss realization to occur after an all-time high, those spenders must be top buyers.
Net Realized Profit/Loss visualizes the daily outcome of on-chain spending in USD terms. Observe:
Consistent profit taking around the all-time highs
, as coins from lower prices are spent to new buyers.
Steep loss realization in the days afterward
as price pulled back over -30%. Losses realized after all-time highs indicates coins purchased at the top.
Relatively flat activity in the past two weeks
, suggesting investor interest is reaching an exhaustion point at current prices.
Live Chart
With the understanding that older coin spending is declining, and Long-Term Holders mostly on the sidelines, we can intuit that recent coin activity is largely contained within the Short-Term Holder cohort. A look at the standing Profit/Loss ratio of Short-Term Holders can show the health of this group's supply and illustrate periods of overheated price action.
High values over 1000
(red) indicate moments of extreme profitability for new investors. These moments are brief and often precede local reversals.
Values between 100-1000
(yellow) mean newer buyers are in healthy profit.
Values below 1
(blue) indicate Short-Term Holders in loss.
Low values near or below 0.1
(green) are moments of heightened vulnerability for new buyers, and frequently mark local bottoms where value is established.
Short-Term Holder PnL spiked dramatically in late October as price ripped to all-time highs. Buyers of coin from August and September suddenly found themselves up 60%+, and the market had to pull back to accommodate profit taking.
Presently, Short-Term Holders finds themselves in aggregate loss, though the pace of decline has slowed along with price. While these coins continue to churn among different hands, their lifespans stay young and they remain members of Short-Term Holder Supply.
Live Workbench Chart
The rotation of coins among newer owners can also be seen in the rate of change of Short-Term Holder Realized Price. As owners of the youngest supply, their cost basis is more responsive to price than their Long-Term Holder cousins. Interpretation of the costs basis for each cohort is nuanced and different:
Short-Term Holder Realized Price
rises
when coins are spent from lower prices, causing them to be re-priced higher and thus raising the aggregate cost basis of the group.
Short Term Holder Realized Price
declines
when price falls. Coins from higher prices are re-priced into new hands at lower costs, pulling down their cost basis.
Long-Term Holder Realized Price
rises
when coins mature from increasingly higher prices as Bitcoin appreciates. The delay in adoption of this group makes their cost basis less responsive to price, and more beholden to maturation behavior by hodlers.
Long-Term Holder Realized Price
declines
rarely, and typically only in prolonged bear markets. Rather than fall, it tends to go sideways as coins mature during long ranging periods for price.
Note the recent increase in Short-Term Holder Realized Price at the October and November highs, showing the re-pricing of coins at higher prices as new investors bought the literal top.
Live Workbench Chart
The ultimate perspective of coin rotation within the Short-Term Holder group is seen in the Percent of Entities in Profit. A remarkable observation on this chart is the arcing trend from late July to present day:
In late July, price was
$32.3k
and
76% of all entities
on-chain were in profit.
When new highs were created in October and November,
100% of entities
were in profit‚Äî an expected outcome of price discovery.
Now in late December, price is
$47.6k (over $15k higher)
and there are again only
76% of entities
in profit.
For price to be over $15k higher (+47%) than summer while the same amount of investors are in profit, knowing that older spending is muted, a great shuffling of coins had to take place at the top
within the Short-Term Holder group
. That means they were coins mostly purchased since July, and signals that the
current holder makeup is top heavy
‚Äî many coins were bought at the top and now sit underwater.
Live Chart
As a cherry on top of the discussion about top heavy supply, we look at the Unrealized Price Distribution, which shows all circulating BTC by its last transacted price. A quick glance reveals that 24.6% of all supply is sitting above the current price around $47,000, meaning 1 in 4 BTC is currently underwater.
Live Chart
Despite Weakness, Strong Hands Continue Stacking
A behavior that has left its stamp on the 2021 Bitcoin market is the steadfast accumulation by investors with a limited history of spending. Illiquid Supply is the amount of BTC held by on-chain entities with >=75% inflows in their ledger history.
The supply in possession of these Illiquid entities sold off in May along with much of the market. Since that time, they have maintained a consistent pressure of accumulation, and are now taking possession of coins at a rate of 3.4x daily coin issuance.
Put another way, strong handed HODLers are absorbing supply at more than triple the rate of new coins being mined each day.
Live Workbench Chart
Strong hands are not the only investors pulling coins away from potential buyers. After a large impulse of deposits to exchanges in May (over $300M on a 14-day basis), Bitcoin has been steadily pulled offline into cold storage in the months following the summer lows.
The chart below shows the net transfer volume to/from all exchanges, which is the difference between all deposits and all withdrawals in USD terms. The initial all-time high break in late October saw around $100M of inflows, but the weeks following have been dominated by consistent exchange outflow volume, seeing average values of -$150M to -$175M on a 14-day basis.
Price weakness has so far not engendered a rush to the exits, as investors are instead creating friction between their ownership and the ability to sell their BTC.
Live Chart
One group that doesn't have a reputation for being strong handed is the miners, who have been a consistent source of spending pressure on the Bitcoin network since inception. Well, perhaps their reputation is in need of an overhaul!
In the past two years, miner behavior has undergone a transformation. Newer, more powerful chips have enhanced operational efficiency, and the expansion of miners into North America has given many of them access to operating capital by exercising cheap debt and corporate equity. The typical miner in 2021 is more resilient than past generations.
What once was a reliable outflow of spending from miner wallets has shifted since 2019, and miners are now depositing more minted supply into their treasuries than before. The chart below shows the 90-day sum of Miner Netflow Volume (in USD) as a percentage of Market Cap, and the multi-year rise is evident.
If miners evolve into being HODLers, a group who are naturally incentivized to spend, then acquiring new Bitcoin into the future could become exceedingly difficult.
Live Workbench Chart
In case you missed it, the past week saw circulating supply pass the 90% mark of its ultimate goal, with circulating supply passing 18.9M BTC. In just under thirteen years, 9/10ths of the total BTC supply has now been issued to miners. Bitcoin's deterministic issuance schedule has much farther to go however, with the remaining 10% of supply set to be minted over the next 119 years or so, ending somewhere near the year 2140.
With so many holder types stacking BTC for the long term, future opportunities to acquire the world's first absolutely scarce digital asset are increasingly limited.

For our final newsletter of the year, we will provide a brief 2021 review of some year-to-date changes across both on-chain, exchange, derivatives, and mining datasets. When looking back at 2021, it interestingly appears to be a year best described as a macro, high time-frame consolidation, albeit a volatile one. The year-to-date summary for Bitcoin is:
Prices are up 78.5% from 1-Jan with a current drawdown of 24.4% from 10-Nov ATH.
The total Supply currently held at a loss is 3.480M BTC, equivalent to 18.34% of circulating supply.
Exchange balances saw a net yearly outflow of 67.8k BTC, a decline of just 2.5%.
Long-Term Holders added 1.846M BTC to their holdings, whilst Short-Term Holder supply declined by 1.428M BTC.
Futures Open Interest almost doubled, increasing by $9.57B (97%) whilst futures trading volume actually declined by 16% to $36.7B/day.
Mining hash-rate has finished 2021 up 27% on the year, after recovering entirely from the great migration where around 53% of miners were shut-off almost overnight.
Meanwhile, aggregate miner revenue is up 58% YTD, and up over 440% since in the halving event in May 2020.

A Brief Review of Bitcoin in 2021
As the recent correction from the ATH progressed lower, it put an increasingly large proportion of supply into an unrealised loss. Coins have been spent and redistributed through this time, which reshuffles the UTXO realised price distribution (URPD). At the time of writing, approximately 3.7M BTC, representing 19.5% of the supply are underwater.
On a more constructive note, a reasonably large volume cluster has been established in this weeks price range, equivalent to 2.214M BTC (11.7% of supply). This indicates that a non-trivial degree of demand has been mobilsed during the consolidation, with a large proportion of coins changing hands between $45k and $50k.
Live Chart
As price rallies to the top end of the consolidation range, we can see the percent of coins in an unrealised profit increased by 10.34%. We can use this to estimate an upper bound on the accumulation that has occurred lately (upper bound since some portion of these coins are likely held from previous instances where price was in this range).
Similar events of large increases (blue), or decreases (pink) in profitable supply are highlighted below, which typically follow periods of relatively heavy redistribution amongst the coin supply.
Live Chart
With respect to on-chain cohorts, there has been a noticeable redistribution in coin supply from Short-Term Holders, to Long-Term Holders. At the time of writing:
Long-Term Holders
added 1.846M BTC to their holdings, bringing their total stack to 13.33M BTC. This reflects an increase of 16% over the year.
Short-Term Holder
supply has declined by 1.428M BTC, with this cohort currently holding 3.01M BTC. This reflects a decline of 32% on the year.
Sovereign Supply
, defined as all coins held outside exchange reserves, is currently at an all-time-high of 13.34M BTC.
Live Workbench Chart
As a proportion of Sovereign Supply, Long-Term Holders have seen their ownership stake increase by 4.8% to reach 74.8% of sovereign supply. To close out the year, LTHs now own 74.8% of all coins outside of exchange reserves, whilst STHs ownership has declined from 28.0% in Jan, to 25.2% today.
This modest transfer of wealth from Short-Term, to Long-Term Holders, despite multiple price ATHs, suggests that 2021 is best described as a macro consolidation, and a period of modest accumulation. Such on-chain behaviour is more typically observed during Bitcoin bear markets, which in hindsight are effectively lengthy periods of coin redistribution from weaker hands, to those with stronger, and longer-term conviction.
Live Chart
The counterpart to Sovereign Supply, is Exchange Balances, which impressively have seen very little net change over the course of the year. Exchange reserves have declined from 2.623M BTC at the start of the year, to 2.560M BTC. This is a net decline of 67.8k BTC, a reduction of just 2.5% from the opening balance. The chart of coins held in exchanges shows a general oscillation over time, with net inflows from May to July, and net outflows otherwise.
Live Chart
We can see this behaviour more clearly in the Net Volume in/out of exchanges, which has spent 2021 oscillating between ¬±5k BTC. In fact over the course of the last week, we have seen another reversal from net exchange outflows, back to net exchange inflows. In the immediate term, this is something to keep an eye on to see if the trend softens, or strengthens as we head into the new year.
Live Chart
Next we will look into the very intriguing YTD changes occurring in futures markets. Total open interest in futures has almost doubled this year, rising by $9.57B (97%) to a total of $18.87B. This week alone has seen an increase of some $2.5B in open interest, primarily led by traders on Binance.
Whilst futures open interest is still some way off all-time-highs, rapid increases in leverage can indicate a clustering of stop-losses and liquidation levels in close proximity to the current price. This adds higher probabilities to a potential short, or long squeeze in the more immediate term.
Live Chart
Alongside an elevated possibility of a leverage squeeze, we also have a general decline in trading volume. Quieter trading activity is typical towards years end, however on a 7-day average basis, futures market volumes have seen a YTD decline of 16%. Thinner volume, and rising open interest (in a concentrated exchange) is a combination that can be favourable to at least a localised leverage squeeze over the coming weeks.
Live Chart
And finally, we look to the mining industry to close out our review. The mining market has experienced a truly unbelievable shake-up in 2021. An estimated 53% of the industry was banned from the once dominant Chinese jurisdiction in May, and forced to relocate almost overnight.
Hash-rate started 2021 at around 143 EH/s, and increased to what was then an ATH of 180 EH/s in mid-May. This was followed by a precipitous decline of 53%, as miners in China were forced to cease operations, and relocate, or redistribute their hardware to new jurisdictions. Incredibly, the mining market has completely recovered from this enormous shift, with hash-rate pushing to new ATHs at 182 EH/s, closing out the year 27% higher.
Live Chart
The success of this transition in the mining market is driven by the free-market incentive of miner revenue, offered by the Bitcoin protocol as a ¬†reward for solving blocks. Some key statistics relating to the aggregate mining revenue (USD denominated, fees plus block subsidy):
$8.5M/day following the May-2020 halving.
$29.1M/day at the start of 2021, up 242% since the halving.
$46.0M/day at the time of writing, up 441% since the halving, and up 58% YTD.
Live Chart
All-in-all, 2021 has been a wild ride for Bitcoin investors, traders, HODLers, analysts, miners, and critics alike. The protocol saw Taproot implemented, miners relocate out of the historically dominant location, and multiple rolls of the FUD dice, landing on all sides at least twice. As is tradition, Bitcoin comes out of the year stronger and more resilient, ready to solve more blocks, and create more opportunities in 2022.

Happy New Year to all of our readers, the Glassnode Team hopes you had a safe and happy break over the holiday season. Also, Happy Birthday to Bitcoin. Thirteen years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, with the following message encoded into the coinbase transaction as a timestamp:
The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
As 2021 wound down, so too did activity in the Bitcoin market, with trading volumes softening, and prices trading more or less sideways. Price has continued to trade in the same range since late November, bouncing between a high of $51,654, and a low of $46,197 this week.
Across many on-chain metrics, there is a general lack of activity, despite a modestly bullish undertone in supply dynamics. Coins continue to migrate to increasingly illiquid, and dormant wallets, whilst investor profitability and cyclical metrics paint a more bearish picture. With a balance of both bull and bear signals at hand, our expectations into the start of 2022 are likely continued sideways consolidation.

Onchain Activity Remains Lacklustre
The first suite of metrics we will asses in this newsletter are associated with activity occurring onchain. Generally speaking, bullish momentum is usually accompanied by increased demand for blockspace, as coins are purchased, sold, and transferred to new owners. Conversely, bearish trends typically see fewer new wallets, reduced transaction demand, and lower network utilisation.
The number of wallet addresses with a non-zero balance is a metric that can be used to assess the longer-term demand for Bitcoin. Over the last year, a net total of 7.462M non-zero balance wallets have been added to the network a 23.2% YoY growth. 1.415M of these were added since the October ATH, 18.9% of the yearly total.
The current ATH of 39.6M of non-zero addresses is 40% higher than the peak set at the end of the 2017 bull market, indicating that user-base growth has been sustained over the last five years.
Live Chart
With respect to daily activity, we can see that the number of active onchain entities has finally managed to break above 275k/day. The chart below highlights in red an observable and rising 'bear market channel'. This shows that during periods of depressed prices, and lower relative interest, there remains a persistent growth in network users.
Both 2017 and 2020-21 bull markets stand out as having markedly more onchain activity relative to this channel. However, the current regime appears to more closely resemble the 'mini-bull' that occurred from April to August 2019. These two periods are similar in that they followed a deep correction and broad capitulation event, but the subsequent rallies could not generate sufficient momentum for a full scale bull market.
The rally in 2019 eventually culminated into a nine month long sideways-to-down trading range, until the final capitulation occurred in March 2020.
Live Chart
Transaction counts paint a similar picture, where the bull markets of 2017 and 2020-21 stand out clearly, hitting over 300k transactions per day at the peaks. Again similarities can be found between April-August 2019 and the current market since September 2021. In both cases, an initial burst of activity supported rallying prices, but failed to sustain any meaningful momentum, with both transaction counts and prices rolling over.
Until there is further expansion in demand for Bitcoin blockspace, it can be reasonably expected that price action will be somewhat uneventful, and likely sideways at a macro scale.
It is worth noting the underlying differences in market structures between the 2019 and 2021-22 periods. The Apr-Aug 2019 rally was largely associated with heavy spot BTC demand due to the PlusToken ponzi scheme, coupled with multiple short squeezes as trades faded the move in futures markets. The current market is best described as strong rally off the July and September lows following heavy accumulation. This rally was sold into after a very strong October, as both macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation concerns crept into markets, and trading firms sought to lock in end of year profits.
Live Chart
Underlying Supply Remains Constructive
One of the hallmarks of bearish markets is actually a constructive undertone in supply dynamics. Whilst the onchain activity above points to a fairly anaemic demand from retail and market tourists, coin dormancy remains impressive, and signs of smarter, more patient money accumulating remain in tact.
December 2020 was the launching point for very strong price performance in Q1 2021, as Bitcoin broke the previous cycle $20k ATH, and pushed on reach over $64k in April.
If we look at the supply last active 1y+ metric, we can see that a great proportion of coins accumulated in late 2020 remain unspent to this day. Since October 2021, over 682k BTC have migrated into the 1yr+ age band, representing 3.3% of the circulating coin supply. Over 57% of the coin supply is now older than 1yr, equivalent to the 51.5% seen at the time of the April 2019 bullish impulse.
Given how volatile 2021 was, seeing such an acceleration and large proportion of coins held throughout is quite remarkable.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply has also plateaued after a very modest period of distribution following the twin ATHs in October and November. This signifies that LTHs have slowed their spending, and are more likely to be HODLers, or even buyers at these prices. This provides another constructive view of market conviction.
LTHs have spent around 150k BTC since October which is just 1.11% of their total held balance. The slow-down in spending is notable given the sharp and sustained correction during this time. Note that this also follows a massive accumulation phase in 2021, where on net, over 2.42M BTC migrated to LTH wallets after March, a balance growth of 22.1%.
Live Chart
We can also assess coin liquidity as a more immediate measure of current coin supply dynamics, such as whether the market is in accumulation (more illiquid) or distribution (more liquid).
Where the Supply Last Active, and Long-Term Holder Supply metrics use time as the primary input (coin-age, or lifespan), our Liquid and Illiquid metrics uses wallet spending heuristics (
see our methodology here
). When a coin is moved to a wallet with no history of spending, it will be classified as illiquid (eg. a HODLer executing a dollar cost averaging strategy). Conversely, a wallet that spends very regularly (eg. day-trader or an exchange hot wallet) will be classified as either Liquid or Highly Liquid.
We can see below that over the final months of 2021, even as prices corrected, there has been an acceleration of coins from Liquid, into Illiquid wallets. Through December, coins moved to increasingly illiquid wallets at a rate of between 50k and 100k BTC/month reflecting a higher likelihood of broader accumulation.
Live Chart
On net, we can see that Illiquid supply (blue) has accelerated higher, at the expense of the combined Liquid and Highly Liquid supply (pink). Illiquid coins now represent 76% of the total supply, and can be seen to have a visible correlation with price. The current conditions do speak to a divergence between what appears to be constructive onchain supply dynamics, compared to bearish-to-neutral price action.
Live Workbench Chart
Lastly on the longer-term macro trends, we can see confluence within the Liveliness metric. Liveliness reflects the relative growth of coin-day creation, and coin-days destroyed in the circulating coin supply. Where more coin-days are created, there is more dormancy and HODLing, and Liveliness will trend lower (blue). Conversely, distribution, particularly by older hands, will see more coin-days destroyed than created and Liveliness will trend higher (pink).
Liveliness appears to be in a strong downtrend even as prices correct. This is typical of bearish markets and periods of accumulation, which further adds to the assessment of
bearish with bullish undertones.
Live Chart
Short Term Holder Pain
Whilst supply dynamics for the more patient smart money appear constructive, there remains a large sector of the market whom are currently underwater on their holdings. Whilst Long-Term Holders appear to have growing conviction, prices are trading below the onchain cost basis of their counterparts, the Short-Term Holders. These are the most likely coins to create sell-side pressure and weigh on a market recovery.
The Realised Price is a metric that values each coin at the time when it was last spent onchain, reflecting the 'valued stored' in Bitcoin, and an estimate of cost basis. The chart below shows the realised price for three cohorts:
Short-Term Holders (pink):
currently trading at $51.4k, meaning this cohort on aggregate is underwater on their investment, and are the most likely to create sell-side resistance.
Aggregate Market (orange):
The realised price for the whole market is currently trading at $24.4k. Generally, the Realised Price provides reliable price support and bear market floors, although it is obviously not ideal to see prices reach this level.
Long-Term Holders (blue):
currently trading at $17.7k, after a steep rise as coins accumulated in H1 2021 at higher prices remain unspent. This metric can be considered a visual observation of LTHs valuing Bitcoin at a higher floor value over time.
Live Workbench Chart
For the Short-Term Holder cohort, the STH-MVRV metric shows the magnitude of current underwater pain relative to past bearish periods. The STH-MVRV is currently trading below 1.0, an event which unfortunately has very few periods since 2017 of being a short lived event. The bearish periods in 2018, 2019 and mid-2021 all saw STHs persistently underwater, with STH-MVRV values of 1 acting as resistance.
Psychologically, this represents new buyers 'getting their money back', which puts $51.4k as a key level to watch.

2022,2,2022-W02,2022-01-10,2022-01-16,Bullish,41824.07,43104.34,42910.40,3.06,Agree,"Bitcoin investors were faced with six consecutive red daily candles this week, accompanied by a broader market sell-off following increased concerns of hawkish policy from the Federal Reserve. Following the release of the December's Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes early in the week, markets reacted to notes related to an accelerated pace of tapering, rate hikes, and of potential quantitative tightening to lighten the central bank's balance sheet.
After opening at $47,875, Bitcoin led global declines, trading down as much as -15% year-to-date. Prices have since closed the first full week of 2022 at $40,672, putting the bulls on the back-foot to start the year. In this week's newsletter, we will unpack a number of concepts underlying the reaction of market participants including:
The climate of older coin spending on-chain,
Increasingly elevated levels of Open Interest in futures markets,
The potential of a near-term short squeeze developing, as prices trade lower, and bear conviction chases the market down.

Only The HODLers Remain
A phase of heavy loss realization by top buyers has followed the December 4 flush-out, as we first reported in
our Week 50 2021 newsletter
. In the weeks since, onchain behavior has been more heavily dominated by the HODLer class, with little activity by newer market entrants.
One way to see this dynamic is through Hodler Net Position Change, which is the rolling 30-day change in coin maturation. As units of BTC age and mature in investor wallets, they accrue Coin Days, which are 'destroyed' upon spending and help to produce various lifespan metrics.
Positive (green) values
mean coins are ageing and maturing at a higher rate than spending. This is typically in bearish market conditions absent retail interest as long-term accumulation takes place by high conviction buyers.
Negative (red) values
occur when elevated rates of spending, particularly by older coins, outpace the present accumulation behavior. This is frequently observed in the heights of bull markets and moments of total capitulation, when older hands are more likely to relinquish their holdings.
Following a brief period of net spending after the early November price peak, maturation has again taken the mantle as price declines. It speaks to a trend typically seen when retail/tourists have left the market, HODLers remain, and generally more bearish forward price expectations.
Live Chart
Another method for measuring spending velocity is via the Value Days Destroyed Multiple (VDD), which compares the monthly sum value of coin destruction to the yearly average.
High VDD Multiple values
signify elevated coin destruction behavior relative to the past year. This historically marks periods of peak market liquidity, large supply turnover, and rising prices.
Low VDD Multiple values
demonstrate a quiet HODLer market with calm relative coin destruction. These moments can stretch for long periods and often occupy cyclical lows.
Using the Value Days Destroyed perspective of activity, the October and November rallies saw a very mild level of spending compared to the long-term average. This is in some ways influenced by the historically high VDD values reached in early 2021, but still shows the value of spending at the recent all-time high was relatively low.
This again paints a picture of a HODLer dominated market, and low relative retail interest.
Live Workbench Chart
Rounding out our assessment of spending behavior is Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow, which compares the Bitcoin market cap (asset valuation) to the annualized dollar value of coin Dormancy (spending motive). Dormancy is the average age (in days) of spent coins per unit of BTC, which is akin to an Average Spent Output Lifespan weighted by volume.
High values of Dormancy Flow
means network value is high relative to the yearly value of realized Dormancy in USD. The interpretation is that the bull market is in ""healthy"" conditions (spending in concert with demand valuation).
Low Dormancy Flow
values indicate moments where market cap is undervalued relative to the yearly sum of realized Dormancy, indicating moments where Bitcoin is a value price.
Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow recently bottomed out, showing a full reset of the metric. These events historically print at cyclical bottoms, and confluence with Hodler Net Position Change and the VDD Multiple hint at a potential floor of spending in the near-term, barring new surprises.
With the above three charts in tow, we can largely identify market conditions typically seen in the late stages of a macro bearish trend, often around capitulation style events. It remains to be seen whether there is more pain to the downside, perhaps in response to macro/monetary headwinds, or whether the majority of the damage has already been done and a bullish relief rally is due.

Futures Markets See New Highs in Open Interest
While on-chain has stayed quiet, the leverage in Bitcoin derivatives market has been growing at an aggressive pace This speaks to an outsized interest in Bitcoin price action as a speculative bet, rather than the relatively tepid demand for Bitcoin in spot markets.
Leading our assessment of derivatives is the growth of Futures Perpetual Open Interest, which is the sum value of all open contracts in the continuous contracts market. Shown here in BTC terms, Perpetual Open Interest has
reached new all-time highs of 264k BTC
in the face of recent price declines, rising +42% since December 4 and surpassing the previous high of 258k BTC set on November 26.
With the first principles understanding that price declines will inherently close out long traders, a growth in Open Interest in recent days hints at short traders layering on bets into market weakness.
Live Chart
Leading the rapid growth of futures speculation are users on Binance, far and away the largest Bitcoin futures exchange by volume and size. Since May 2021, Binance has enjoyed the lion's share of Futures Open Interest among all exchanges, with a notable increase in market share during recent weeks. Since the dramatic purge on December 4th, Binance has absorbed 9.4% of Bitcoin's Futures Open Interest, and
now dominates with a 30% market share
.
The second largest exchange by Open Interest market share is FTX with 19%, surpassing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). CME had seen a jump in market dominance in October at the launch of the $BITO ETF, but is now the third largest at 15% of Futures Open Interest.
Live Workbench Chart
The dramatic leap in Futures Open Interest can be viewed in another way: representing itself as a leverage ratio against the Market Cap. Typically, periods where Futures Open Interest exceeds >= 2% of Market Cap are short-lived, and tend to end with a dramatic flush of margin.
De-leveraging events can occur in either direction, and at times have triggered despite an Open Interest leverage ratio below 2%, like on September 7 when El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender. The combination of elevated Open Interest plus a big news event catalyzed a volatile move down.
However, each instance where leverage exceeded 2% in the past year ended with a swift liquidation of contracts. At time of writing,
Futures Open Interest Leverage Ratio is at 1.98%
so there exists a non-trivial risk of high volatility in the short term.
Live Workbench Chart
Short-Term Squeeze of Shorts?
A byproduct of consistent downtrends in price are the liquidation of confident long traders trying to catch a falling knife. A great way to view the trend of liquidations is via the dominance oscillator between long and short liquidations.
Since November, Bitcoin futures has been in a regime of long liquidation dominance, where traders betting on ""Number Go Up"" are consistently on the losing side. This value recently spiked to a local high of 69%, its
highest value since the May 2021 crash
.
Factoring in this observation with the aforementioned rise of Open Interest into declining price, and the probability of a local reversal is increasing. Short traders, who have not been punished for taking on increasing risk, may find themselves candidates for a near-term squeeze.
Live Chart
As the volume of open contracts in futures rise to new highs, the daily sum of traded volume in futures has been trending in the opposite direction. Large price movements result in contracts changing hands and stop losses being triggered. In sideways price action, traders get away with not having to close their positions, allowing volumes to decline in periods of consolidation while Open Interest can remain high.
Futures Volume saw its zenith in the first half of 2021, where daily trading exceeded $75 billion/day for weeks at a time. Following the market decline of 50% into July, the October rally to all-time highs was supported by volume back up around $65 billion/day.
In the current environment however, the 14-day average of daily Futures Volume is around $38 billion/day, the same level it was in the depths of the July lows. Low trading volumes can however create environments of reduced market depth, and limited resistance against rapid price moves. Should a deleveraging event follow, in a low liquidity environment, the magnitude of the price move may well be greatly amplified.
Live Chart
Rounding out our look at derivatives is Options Open Interest. Coming into December, all eyes were on the end-of-year strike on December 31, following months of buildup to the tune of more than $11 billion in contracts. Many of these contracts were dominated by bulls, with a particular emphasis on Bitcoin prices exceeding $100k.
By January 1, Options Open Interest was down to $6.2 billion from a December 31 value of $11.2 billion, a haircut of -45% ($5B). The end-of-year strike was the largest of 2021 in percentage closures, but only the second in total dollars. The March 26 strike saw a record $5.3 billion closed at expiration, a reduction of -36%.
Live Chart
In summary, the current Bitcoin market structure can be best described as having:
Tepid demand for spot
, with the majority of onchain metrics describing a dominance of HODLers in accumulation, typical of bearish markets with low retail/tourist interest.
Derivatives market leverage is at high risk levels
around 2% of the market cap. This is strongly lead by Binance markets, and open interest has increased as prices decline.
An elevated risk of a deleveraging exists, coupled with low trading volumes, and an elevated probability of short-dominance in futures markets.
Alongside very oversold indicators in onchain spending activity, this suggests a short squeeze is actually a reasonably likely near-term resolution for the market. Whether it can overcome macro headwinds, and reestablish a convincing uptrend will be a focus for upcoming newsletters.

. Investors and traders appear to be digesting the macro possibilities within this new inflationary regime markets have entered, alongside an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve. This change in tune has rattled the Bitcoin market in the short term, and at risk of taking control over its medium term prospects.

HODLers Profits Under Siege
The Bitcoin price is currently trading down
~35%
from the ATH set in November 2021. As the drawdown worsens, an increasingly significant volume of BTC supply has fallen into an unrealized loss. Approximately 5.7 million BTC are now underwater (~30% of circulating supply).
As the bears apply pressure to the in-profit cohort of holders, Bitcoin bulls are defending a historically significant level of the Percent of Supply in Profit metric. This magnitude of 'top heavy supply' was defended in two instances in the last few years:
May 2020 - July 2020
, the quiet recovery period following the extreme move downwards from Covid-related panic.
May 2021 - July 2021
, the choppy and accumulative period following a historical deleveraging event.
The reaction from this level will likely provide insight into the medium term direction of the Bitcoin market. Further weakness may motivate these underwater sellers to finally capitulate, whereas a strong bullish impulse may offer much needed psychological relief, and put more coins back into an unrealized profit.
Live Chart
We can establish an appreciation of market-wide psychology by observing who is parting ways with their coins, and why and when these spends are taking place. The Percent of Transfer Volume in Profit chart displays the proportion of coins spent on-chain that were last moved at lower prices, as a gauge for macro fear and greed.
Percent of Transfer Volume in Profit
> 65%
signals that a large amount of coins are being spent in profit. This historically occurs during bullish impulses, as holders take advantage of market strength.
Percent of Transfer Volume in Profit < 40%
signals that on-chain volumes are dominated by coins acquired at higher prices. This historically occurs in market downtrends and especially capitulation events.
The sell-off this week saw less than 40% of spent volume in profit, reaching levels that historically coincide with capitulation events. Past instances at this level have preceded a bullish reversal, and a period of general risk-on behaviour.
Live Chart
The low levels of profitable coin spends is also evident in the Realized Profit chart, which shows the profitability of BTC moved, on a USD basis. In-profit holders are displaying a notable unwillingness to spend coins, with consistent Realized Profit values below
$1 Billion/day
. In the face of tumultuous and unconvincing price action, this signals that this cohort of holders are patiently waiting for higher prices to spend their respective supply.
Climbing realized profits, especially above the $1 Billion level and accompanied by positive price performance, signals demand absorption of coins, and is a metric to watch in the coming weeks.
Live Chart
Meanwhile, Realized Losses remain elevated and trending higher, as underwater holders spend coins that were acquired near the market top through October and November.
On average, daily Realized Loss values are
~$750 Million/day
, behavior that is comparable to the May - July 2021 capitulation lows. The consistency of large loss realization events is indicative of uneasiness within the market, however also reflects an estimate of demand inflows to absorb these spent coins.
Sustained periods of large realized loss does put the onus on the bulls to prove sufficient demand support. A macro decline in realized loss values would be a more encouraging signal for the bulls, as it provides an early indication of sell-side exhaustion.
Live Chart
The stalemate at play between price action, Realized Profits, and Realized Losses is visible in the 28-day Market Realized Gradient (MRG), which compares the momentum in Market Cap (speculative value) versus the Realized Cap (real capital inflows).
Positive values
signal that a bull trend is in tact, and upwards momentum in spot markets is growing.
Negative values
signal that a bear trend is in play, and momentum favors the bears.
Large values
signal that Bitcoin is possibly overbought (positive) or oversold (negative), as market valuation deviates from more fundamental capital inflows or outflows, respectively.
The MRG trend and values indicate that current market pricing is nearing a point of equilibrium with capital inflows, with a month's long bullish divergence developing. A firm break above zero would signal a bullish reversal is in play, whilst a break down would suggest momentum is accelerating to the downside.
Live Workbench Chart
Cohorts and Psychology
We can also analyse the psychology and spending behaviour of both Short-Term Holders (STH) and Long-Term Holders (LTH) by looking at changes in their respective Realized Caps and supply dynamics.
The following metric is calculated as the difference between the daily change of LTH and STH realized caps. Interpretation is as follows:
Negative Values (red)
signal that the STH Realized Cap is increasing more on a daily basis than the LTH Realized Cap. This occurs during bull runs when long term holders distribute supply into new holders.
Positive Values (green)
signal that the LTH Realized Cap is increasing more on a daily basis than the STH Realized Cap, which occurs during bearish accumulation markets as STH activity decreases, and unspent coins mature into the LTH cohort.
Values currently sit near zero with a general trend to the upside, indicative of a softening of distribution by LTHs, the market reaching a new equilibrium, and a potential reversal into accumulation. Note however, that the process of establishing similar market equilibrium and possible macro bottoms has historically taken several months to resolve.
Live Workbench Chart
The modest distribution of coins from LTHs to STHs is reflected in the Total Supply Held metric, as the net volume of coins held by the STH cohort has increased in recent months.
The supply held by this cohort sits at
~3 Million BTC
, a relative historical low, and a level that signifies a transition into a HODLer dominated market. This has been in effect since the May 2021 deleveraging event. Low STH supply levels are typical of bearish trends, as old coins remain dormant, and younger coins are slowly accumulated by high conviction buyers.
Live Chart
Next we turn to the Realized Cap HODL Waves, which reflects the breakdown of the Realized Cap by coin age, and cost basis. The chart below has been filtered for coins younger than 3 months to further highlight the forces at play within the shorter term holder cohort.
Generally speaking, lower values in this metric speak to a bearish trend where old coins are dormant, and young coins are gradually accumulated and taken off market.
At present, around 40% of the Realized Cap is held in coins under 3mths old, owned by buyers entering near the market top, or during the present correction. The 1-3m band is expanding and a constructive view would see these coins continue to mature into the 3m+ band, creating a net decline in young coins. A more bearish observation would be if older coins start being spent, causing these bands to swell, and signifying an additional influx of liquid supply that must be absorbed.
Live Chart
Derivatives Fireworks on the Horizon
Amidst downwards pressure in Bitcoin holder profitability but yet favorable medium to long term supply dynamics, futures markets remain a powder keg for short term volatility with Perpetual Futures Open Interest at
~250k BTC
- a historically elevated level.
Since April 2021, this has paired with large pivots in price action as the risk for a short or long squeeze increases, resolved in market wide deleveraging events.
Live Chart
Alongside high open interest, funding rates this week moved into negative territory, indicating that shorts were increasingly hungry for leverage. As perpetual swap markets were pushed below spot prices, it does add further bias towards a potential oversupply of short positions in close proximity to the current price.
Live Chart
In addition to large outstanding open interest, and negative funding rates, trading volume continues to drip lower, currently around $30B per day. This is coincident with levels in December 2020, and reflects a marked reduction from the 2021 bull market highs, hitting well above $70B/day. Should a deleveraging event occur, thinner trading volumes may accentuate the impact.
Live Chart
As Open Interest continues charging for a big move, funding rates drop, and futures volumes contract, Crypto-Margined Open Interest continues its march downwards versus Cash-Margined Open Interest.
With only
40%
of Open Interest sitting in Crypto-Margined products and in a convincing downtrend since May 2021, Cash-Margined Futures data becomes increasingly higher signal and worthy of more market participants' attention. Note that this trend is primarily driven by a relative reduction in crypto-margin on Binance, Bybit, Huobi and OKEx exchanges.
Live Chart
In summary, there is evidence that the market is reaching some form of price and momentum equilibrium, within what is a broader bearish market structure. Bitcoin bears certainly have the upper hand, however modest bullish divergences are appearing across a number of on-chain metrics and indicators. Coupled with elevated future open interest, and a bias that appears to be a short heavy market, a risk of a deleveraging to the upside remains on the table.

Sizing up a Bear
At the weekly low, Bitcoin prices were just shy of being cut in half from the ATH, reaching a total drawdown of 49.9%. This is now the second worst sell-off since the 2018-20 bear market, eclipsed only by July 2021, where the market fell -54% from the highs set in April.
With the bulls now firmly on the back-foot, such a heavy drawdown is likely to change investor perceptions and sentiment at a macro scale. Drawdowns of this magnitude are markedly higher than the -20% to -40% range seen in the 2017 and 2020-21 bull cycle corrections.
Live Chart
The Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric presents the overall market profitability as a proportion of market cap. NUPL is currently trading at 0.325 which indicates that an equivalent to 32.5% of the Bitcoin market cap is held as an unrealised profit.
This comes in stark contrast to the much higher profitability values of ~0.75 set in March, and ~0.68 set in October last year. There are a number of indications from this:
Considering previous cycles, such
low profitability is typical in the early to mid phase of a bear market (orange)
. One could also reasonably argue that a bear market started in May 2021 based on this observation.
Unlike 2013 and 2017 bull markets, aggregate network profitability actually declined between the ATHs set through Mar-Apr and Oct-Nov tops. This is a result of coins being distributed at the highs, lifting the overall market cost basis, and thus creating a
bearish divergence in this indicator
.
Live Chart
Another measure of network profitability is the MVRV Ratio, presented below as a Z-Score, tracking standard deviations away from the long-term mean. The MVRV Ratio is calculated as the market cap, divided by the realised cap; and is a useful tool for for identifying periods of high, and poor investor profitability.
With a current MVRV-Z reading of 0.85, the market is well within territory visited in bearish markets, and a bearish divergence is noted, similar to the NUPL metric above. Generally speaking, such low values of MVRV-Z are reached in the following cases:
Steep corrections in bull markets (blue arrows)
, which are usually followed by a reversal to new highs.
Early bear markets after blow-off tops (pink arrows)
, as the market panics, investors capitulate, and also often precedes a strong relief bounce.
Mid-to-late bear markets (red boxes)
where MVRV-Z trades below 0.85, signifying a period of very poor profitability, low sentiment, and sustained investor loses.
By this metric, the bulls either need to step up in a big way, else the probabilities favour the bears. That said, a relief bounce in the near term is also probable if history is to act as a guide.
Live Chart
A recently developed on-chain tool is the Realised-to-Liveliness Ratio (RTLR) by
Dor Shahar
, who a modified the Realised Price using Liveliness in the denominator. It can be though of as a '
Hodler fair value'
model, and is designed to amplify, or discount the Realised Price as follows:
RTLR will indicate a higher fair value for Bitcoin
when HODLers are accumulating and keeping coins dormant (fair value > cost basis).
RTLR will converge to the Realised Price
as more HODLers liquidate and distribute their coins (fair value = cost basis)
In the chart below, we can see that the market is now trading below the RTLR price of $39.2k, but above the Realised price of $24.2k. Again, this is often observed during early to mid stage bear markets, adding confluence to the observations above.
Live Workbench Chart
Assessing The Damage
We have now established that numerous signals point to a macro scale bear trend in play. With this as prologue, we now turn to investor spending patterns, where the week was punctuated by investors capitulating significant losses onchain.
The Net Realised Profit/Loss metric tracks the amount of market wide profit, minus loss realised by on-chain spending. This provides a measure of daily capital flowing in and out of the Bitcoin network.
As the market traded down to the weekly lows on Saturday, over $2.5 Billion in net losses were realised, with investors spending coins held at a loss. This marks the largest capitulation event of this drawdown, and almost matches the $2.61 Billion net loss from May 2021 (
read our analysis of that sell-off here
).
Live Chart
Over the last 7-day period, the total sum of realised losses has now exceeded $7.57 Billion, again in a similar ballpark to major capitulation events over the past 12 months. It can be seen in the chart below that large realised loss events typically correlate with local market lows, as investors who bought the recent top capitulate, and stronger hands and traders drive the market into a relief rally.
Note however that the current drawdown has seen sustained and elevated losses since early November, indicating that this correction has been a particularly painful one.
Live Workbench Chart
Short-Term Pain...For Long Term Gain?
Looking at the cross-sections of investors whom realised the majority of these losses, we can determine that it is largely the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort. Coins are considered to be owned by STHs when they are younger than ~155-days, and are statistically more likely to be spent in the face of volatility.
The STH-SOPR metric has accelerated downwards this week, after finding resistance at a value of 1.0 throughout this drawdown. Psychologically, this suggests that recent buyers are taking exits at, or below their cost basis to 'get their money back', creating sell-side pressure and resistance. Lower values indicate heavier losses are taken by STHs, who in this instance are disproportionately top buyers.
Live Chart
Assessing the supply dynamics, we can see that Short-Term Holders are currently in possession of approximately 18.3% of the coin supply (excluding coins held by exchanges). The light red area in the chart below represent the proportion that are currently held at a loss, and as of this week, almost the entire STH supply is underwater.
This yet again creates a psychological barrier whereby the coins that are already the most likely to be spent and sold, are now also holding an unrealised losses, which further increases the chances of a sale.
Live Chart
Interestingly, STH supply remains near multi-year lows, which is indicative of their counter-part, the Long-Term Holders (LTHs), who appear impressively unfazed by such a severe drawdown.
The proportion of LTH supply has actually returned to a modest uptrend, which indicates a general unwillingness for this cohort to liquidate. Faced with what looks like a bear market, LTH coins are firmly in cold storage, which remains a constructive undertone.
Like STHs, the LTH cohort are not without financial pain, with 6.04% of the 81.7% supply held by LTHs falling into an unrealised loss this week. This is the highest volume of LTH supply held at a loss since the March 2020 sell-off.
Live Chart
And finally, to close out our analysis for the week, we highlight ¬†that the total coin volume older than 1yr has been on a remarkable ascent since October. Over 59.3% of the circulating supply has now been dormant for over 1yr, increasing by 5.8% of circulating supply in the last three months.
These coins reflect those last moved onchain between Oct 2020, and Jan 2021 during the early, and more exciting phase of the bull cycle. Whilst a rising, and large proportion of mature coins is generally considered constructive, it once again bears similarities to a bear market, a time when only the HODLers and patient accumulators remain.
Live Chart
Summary
Bear markets are hard to define in Bitcoin, as the traditional 20% drawdown metric would trigger a bear almost every second Tuesday given the volatility. Thus we look to investor psychology and profitability as a gauge of likely, and actualised sell-side activity.
What we identified this week are significant realised losses, a steep drawdown, a return to HODLer led accumulation, and top buyers taking any opportunity to get their money back. If it looks like a bear, and walks like a bear, it could very well be a bear. But as with many things over the last two years...could this time different?
This is a question we will continue to explore over the coming weeks. See you then.
Surveying the 21-Jan Sell-off
In this video analysis, we use both on-chain, and off-chain derivatives metrics to identify and explain the mechanics driving recent downside price-action. When markets sell-off, we can use these tools to investigate which cohorts of coin holders are spending, and whether a leverage flush out is occurring in futures markets.

In this week's edition, we shift our focus to an assessment of demand, in order to capture the other side of the equation. On-chain tools can provide insight into both supply and demand, and with the established macro bearish outlook as a background, we now seek to identify whether the underlying demand profile is sufficient to start establishing a market bottom.

Negativity Enters Derivative Markets
Over the course of 2021, trading volumes in futures markets have been in macro decline, falling over 50% from $80B/day in March 2021, to under $40B/day in January 2022. As is commonplace during high volatility events, this week's sell-off to $33k was met with a significant uplift in trading volume, hitting just under $60B/day.
Binance remains the dominant venue, hosting the lions share of futures trade volume, representing over 52.5% of all contracts this week.
Live Chart
Even with relatively low trading volumes, futures open interest remains remarkably elevated, particularly for perpetual swaps. As a percentage of the Bitcoin market cap, open interest in perpetual swaps (purple) is hovering around 1.3%, which is historically high, and often as precursor to a deleveraging event.
Open interest across all futures markets (including perpetual swaps) is elevated at 1.9% of market cap (orange), however this is closer to the middle of the range in typical values. This observation indicates that a great majority of current futures leverage is held by traders of perpetual contracts (heavily concentrated on Binance).
Live Chart
With this elevated leverage and relevance of perpetual swap markets, we can look to funding rates to get a sense of market bias and direction where leverage is most heavily applied. Funding rates have traded negative for much of January, indicating that a modest short bias exists in perpetual swap markets.
Live Chart
Similar negativity is seen in options markets, with the Put/Call ratio rising to 59%, a multi-month high. This indicates that traders have shifted their preference away from calls, and towards buying downside insurance, even as the market trades to 6-month lows.
Live Chart
With this observable shift from long into short bias across derivatives markets, the dominance of futures liquidations has started to creep towards the short side. With high negativity, elevated leverage, and a overall short bias, a reasonable argument could be made for a potential counter-trend short squeeze in the near-term.
Live Chart
Assessing On-chain Demand
Assessing the demand of the market using on-chain tools is nuanced, and requires an understanding of market participants, and the destinations of spent coin volumes (i.e. in/out of exchanges, in/out of HODLer wallets etc). This week we will focus on demand from on three key areas:
Wallet growth and accumulation/distribution trends.
Flow of funds in/out of exchange reserves.
Network utilisation as a settlement layer to gauge 'fair value'.
First, we look at a fairly foundational and simple metric, the number of non-zero wallet balances. Generally speaking, when the Bitcoin network experiences a large scale investor flush out (such as the 2017 blow-off top), investors spend many UTXOs from their wallets, deposit coins to exchanges, whom then consolidate that supply into a small set number of large balance wallets.
Such a wallet purge is quite obvious following the 2017 top, and a smaller flush out can be seen in May last year. In both instances, the number of non-zero address resumed an uptrend once the dust had settled, usually around the middle phase of the bear market that followed as buyers recommenced accumulation.
The current upwards trajectory of non-zero wallet counts appears to be largely unaffected by the last three months of depressed prices, sporting similarities to the mini-bear of 2019, and hitting a new ATH of 40.16M addresses.
Live Chart
Retail size wallets, holding < 1BTC (shrimps), also appear unfazed by this correction, with supply held in these wallets continuing to climb. The rate of supply growth for this cohort has seen two macro increases, first after March 2020, and again after May 2021. Given Bitcoin's history as a grassroots phenomena, this speaks to a growing class of 'sat stackers' and HODLers who remain throughout all market conditions.
Live Chart
In order to further classify the coin supply, we use groupings termed Illiquid, Liquid and Highly Liquid supply, based on the spending patterns of wallets (
methodology here
). When mapped as a proportion of market cap, the percent of Illiquid supply (blue) has now reached 76.2% of circulating, returning to Dec 2017 levels. These coins are held in wallets with little-to-no history of spending, and thus reflect a cohort of wallets that are likely in accumulation mode.
Bearish periods (red zones)
such as 2018 and May-July 2021 are punctuated by large declines in Illiquid supply. This means an large volume of coins were spent out of cold storage, and must be subsequently absorbed by new buy side demand.
Bullish periods (green zones)
such as post-March 2020 typically see Illiquid supply increase, as accumulation takes place, and demand soaks up sold coins.
Interestingly, prices in the current market are declining (bearish), whilst Illiquid supply is in a marked uptick (bullish). This week alone, over 0.27% of the supply (~51k BTC) was moved from a Liquid to Illiquid state. Within a macro bearish backdrop, this does raise the question as to whether a bullish supply divergence, similar to May-July 2021, is in effect.
Live Workbench Chart
Exchange balances are one of the larger constituents of the Liquid and Highly Liquid supply metrics, and thus it makes sense to look at flows in and out to validate the observations made above. The exchange net position change is a metric showing this net monthly flow of coins in (green), and out (red) of the exchanges we track.
This week, we have seen net outflows of a reasonably high magnitude, with rates between 45k and 59k BTC per month. This has confluence with the increase in Illiquid supply (~51k BTC), indicating that some portion of the exchange withdrawn coins may have moved to colder storage.
Live Chart
As a result, total exchange reserves have declined to multi-year lows, reaching 13.27% of the circulating supply. It is important to note that this is very different to the market reaction observed in the May-July 2021 drawdown:
Both periods
experienced over 50% price drawdowns from the ATH.
May-July 2021
saw over 164k BTC (0.84% of circulating) in net
inflows to exchanges
, alongside a
decline in Illiquid supply
equal to of 1.5% circulating supply.
The current drawdown
has seen
exchange balances decline
by 42.9k BTC (0.28% of circulating) since the November ATH, whilst I
lliquid supply has increased
by 0.86% of circulating supply.
Despite equivalent scale drawdowns, the trends in exchange reserves and coin liquidity are trending in opposite directions. The current environment has a markedly more bullish undertone of supply absorption, and far fewer coins being spent and sold in fear.
Live Chart
Network Utility On the Rise
Bitcoin is many things to many people, and one of those things is a settlement layer for value. In theory, the more value Bitcoin settles as a network, the more utility is served, and the higher the network should be valued, and vice-versa.
The blow-off top in 2017 was marked by an explosion in settlement volumes, peaking above $10B/day. This was quickly followed by an equally incredible 80% decline back to $2B/day, all within just a few months. The mania phase came and went with gusto.
The market since Oct 2020 has been very different.
During both of the aforementioned 50%+ drawdowns, settlement volumes declined significantly from the peaks. However, the floor value has continued to grow, even during bearish trends (red zones). This speaks to a more sustained, and even growing utility of Bitcoin as the market cap, holder base, and value stored increases.
Live Chart
The make-up of these settlement volumes has also seen an undeniable shift since October 2020, away from retail sized transactions (<$100k), and towards high-net-worth and institutional sized values (>$1M).
Transactions $10M+ in size now dominate 45% of settled volume, whilst sizes > $1M dominate over 70% (on an entity-adjusted basis). Large size transactions have sustained this elevated dominance throughout 2021, and have actually peaked higher over the course of this correction.
Live Chart
Finally, we can construct an implied pricing model using the NVT Ratio, which maps network settlement volume (utility), to an implied price (
methodology by Willy Woo
). The market price is currently trading between the faster 28-day (green) and slower 90-day (pink) NVT price models, arguably putting Bitcoin in a zone of 'fair value' right now.
Taking a ratio of price and the 90-day NVT price gives an 'NVT Premium', which is currently trading at lows that are historically considered undervalued. Previous instances where settlement volumes have been this high relative to the market cap have preceded strong bullish impulses in bear markets, or at macro market bottoms such as Dec 2018, and Mar 2020.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary
In our previous report
, we explored the current supply dynamics, and determined they are characteristic of most historical Bitcoin bear markets. This week we shifted gears to look into the underlying demand side of the equation, which reveals a marked difference between current market structure, and the most recent bearish period in May-July 2021.
Whilst both experienced 50%+ drawdowns in price, the current market appears to have a resilient and persistent class of HODLers, whom appear to be accumulation mode through rain, hail or shine. On-chain settlement volumes are down from the highs, however are increasing relative to market valuation, suggesting Bitcoin is now closer to a 'fair value', than it is to a cycle top.
Meanwhile, derivatives markets appear to be betting on further downside. Within the context of a macro bear, this begs the question; is the market late to hedge out risk, or is it due for an upside correction to shake-out this peak in leveraged negativity?

In this week's edition, we will assess the underlying support that established the recent price lows, as well as the various mechanisms that are driving the market higher. Prices have bounced off a number of fundamental levels that have historically signalled undervaluation or a 'fair value' price. We also discuss whether the short squeeze discussed
in the previous edition
has played out, and the spending patterns of short-term holders in response to market upside.
We also provide some commentary on the recent spend of 96.4k BTC associated with the Bitfinex hack in 2016, and how this was detected in various on-chain metrics.

Fundamental Support
Throughout 2021 and 2022, the $30k to $40k price range has proven to be a sturdy support level for the Bitcoin bulls. In 2021, this range was defended after the 50%+ drawdown in May-July, provided support in the September correction, and has once again been a source of bid support in Jan-Feb this year.
The URPD metric shows the distribution of realised prices for the current Bitcoin UTXO set. Here we can see that 2.351M BTC (12.41% of supply) have last transacted between $36.2k and $41.2k. Even with these coins being redistributed to lower realised values, the market remains top-heavy, with more than 25% of the circulating supply having last transacted at higher prices.
Live Chart
As the market pushes higher, one mechanism driving it may be the squeezing of late entry shorts as discussed in
last week's edition
. Inspecting the Long Liquidation Dominance charts shows that shorts have been on the back-foot this week, with a minor skew towards short side liquidations.
However, the magnitude of this metric remains fairly lacklustre, indicating that it is unlikely that price upside is being primarily driven by a short squeeze.
Live Chart
This is largely confirmed by the 1-day change in Futures Open Interest, where we have not yet seen the characteristic de-leveraging event, where a large volume of open contracts are forced closed. Futures Open Interest does however remain elevated at around 1.91% of the Bitcoin Market cap (~$15Billion).
This may indicate the probability of a short squeeze is lower than first estimated, or that such an event remains possible should the market continue higher, reaching clusters of short seller stop-loss/liquidation levels.
Live Workbench Chart
Looking to the spot/onchain markets, we can see that the Bitcoin network saw an impulse of new net entities this week, pushing up to a net growth of 18.5k entities per day. Through 2021, large impulses of net entities have occurred around volatile periods such as bull market corrections in Q1-Q2, and during the 50%+ sell-off in May.
June to Dec 2021 was a period of quiet accumulation with a stable baseline of 12.5k net entities entering the network per day. As such, the recent spikes in Jan and Feb may suggest a tentative transition out of HODLer dominated accumulation, or at least a renewed interest in Bitcoin after trading down to more attractive entry prices.

Short Term Momentum Swings Upwards
For the first time since late November, Short-Term holders (STHs) have seen a profitable day, with STH-SOPR breaking above 1.0. This indicates that coins that were spent, and younger than 155-days, realised profits on aggregate this week. This follows more than two months realising losses every day as STHs who bought the top, were shaken out of their coins at lower prices.
A similar STH-SOPR pattern can be seen in two instances since March 2020. After a long period of losses, the market managed to break into a bullish uptrend, with a STH-SOPR retest of 1.0 to confirm. Should we see STH-SOPR break higher again, it indicates renewed profitability and demand inflows are absorbing coins. Conversely, a break back below 1.0 would be a bearish indicator, and suggests there is insufficient demand to support sell-pressure from STHs.
Live Chart
We can also see a fairly dramatic bullish divergence playing out on the 14-day Market-Realised Gradient (MRG) oscillator. This metric models the degree of momentum in market pricing relative to the natural capital inflows, captured in the Realised cap. General interpretation is as follows:
Successive Higher/Lower peaks
indicate increasing momentum to the Upside/Downside, respectively.
Breaks above/below 0
indicate that a new uptrend/downtrend is in play, with an anticipated swing duration of ~14-days.
Where the market top in Mar-Apr 2021 showed a bearish divergence (declining market momentum with higher highs in price), the current period reflects a bullish divergence. With each new price low set, there is reducing momentum to the downside, and the 14-day MRG has now convincingly broken above 0. The
28-day MRG
actually shows similar market structure, providing confluence and magnitude to the argument for at least a local market low being established.
Live Workbench Chart
This upswing follows a fairly persistent three month downtrend, which pushed the monthly return profile for Bitcoin well into negative territory. The chart below shows Bitcoin returns (as %) over a rolling 30-day window, with negative returns of -30% historically signalling oversold conditions. Monthly returns have only been this poor in five periods in the last 5-years:
The corrections in Jan-Apr 2018 which started the bear market.
The November 2018 bear market capitulation event.
The March 2020 market wide sell-off as COVID locked down global economies.
The May 2021 sell-off and de-leveraging event.
The YTD performance in 2022.

Estimates of Bitcoin's Fair Value
There have been many approaches and models proposed to valuing Bitcoin over the years, and the assessment of any set should be accompanied by confluence between numerous metrics and indicators.
One of the simplest, but still very powerful tools for this is the Mayer Multiple, calculated as a ratio between price and the 200-day moving average. The 200DMA is widely observed as a long-term bull/bear indicator in technical analysis, and as such steep deviations below it can indicate a degree of undervaluation relative to a long-term mean. The Mayer Multiple traded below 0.8 this week, representing a 20%+ discount relative to the 200DMA. The price level representing a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 is $39.1k, which the market has now reclaimed (calculated as 0.8 x 200DMA).
Similar to the Monthly Returns metric, previous instances of a Mayer Multiple trading below 0.8 typically correlate with severe drawdowns in bear markets, and particularly during market-wide capitulation events (e.g. Jan 2015, Nov 2018 and Mar 2020).
Live Chart
Another metric that reflects a 'fair value' is the Realised-to-Liveliness Ratio (RTLR) which is proposed to estimate the 'fair value' of Bitcoin as priced by the HODLer cohort. During periods of heavy coin dormancy, Liveliness declines, and the realised price is thus amplified when Liveliness is placed in the denominator (and vice-versa).
This metric has provided support in late 2020 prior to the main bull market impulse, and again in June and July 2021. The market traded below this level last week, but has since reclaimed the RTLR level of $39,958, which is reasonably consistent with the support level with a Mayer Multiple of 0.8.
Live Workbench Chart
On the 2016 Bitfinex Hack Wallet
This week a number of on-chain metrics detected a very large spend of 94,643 BTC associated with wallets from the
2016 Bitfinex hack
, with a market value of $3.67 Billion. Given the large size, both in coin volume, USD value, profit realised, and lifespan destroyed, this makes for an interesting case study in assessing how anomalous on-chain events affect metric interpretation.
We can see in 5yr+ revived supply that this spend is the largest 5yr+ old spend in history, eclipsing the previous high of 71.825k in Jan 2019 when prices were $3,629.
Live Chart
Coin-days destroyed also spiked to multi-year highs with a total of 195M coin-days destroyed, of which 190M (97%) are associated with the Bitfinex wallets.
Live Chart
As noted above, a declining Liveliness metric indicates that across the entire coin supply, a greater volume of coins are dormant and accumulating lifespan (coin-days), compared to those being spent, destroying coin-days. This is typical of periods of HODLer accumulation, and is often synonymous with bear markets.
Liveliness is in an established downtrend, with the notable exception of a vertical increase this week in response to the Bitfinex spend, which lifted this macro scale metric by 0.38% on the day.
Live Chart
One lifespan metric that can be deployed to cut through anomalies such as this one, where a small number of wallets spend very large/old coins, is ASOL. Average Spent Output Lifespan measures the average lifespan of spent coins on a per UTXO basis, ignoring coin volume completely (which is measured by CDD and Dormancy for example).
ASOL did not respond meaningfully to the Bitfinex wallet and is actually breaking down to lows last visited in June 2021. Uptrends in ASOL are typical when there is widespread distribution by older coins, usually in bull markets. By contrast, downtrends such as the one in play suggest HODLing is the preferred behaviour, which is consistent with the macro scale downtrend in Liveliness.
Live Chart
Summary
As the Bitcoin prices bounce from multi-month lows, we investigated the potential driving mechanisms, and evaluated the support provided by investors in the $30k-$40k range. The market lows of $33.5k set last week were associated with historical undervaluation across a range of metrics including the Mayer Multiple, RTLR, and the monthly return profile.
The market remains top-heavy in supply distribution, with over 25% of all BTC holding unrealised losses. However, there is a reasonable degree of momentum behind this rally, with STHs returning to profitability, and the short-range MRG oscillators flipping positive. Key to watch moving forward is whether Long-term holders and older coins take exit liquidity, and whether the rally can be supported by renewed demand which has been lacking in general since the May sell-off.

This week has seen Bitcoin derivatives markets pricing in this uncertainty, with a flattening out of the futures term structure curve until March. Futures premiums out to the end of 2022 are notably low, trading at just 6% annualised, and the market is expressing a strong preference for protective put options.
Simultaneously, on-chain supply dynamics are remarkably stable, a likely indication that investors are prepared to ride out whatever storm lies ahead, preferring to utilise derivatives to hedge out risks. Overall, this speaks to the continuing maturation of the Bitcoin market, as liquidity deepens, and more comprehensive risk management instruments become available. This differs greatly in comparison to historical Bitcoin market cycles where de-risking was possible only by the sale of coins in spot markets.
Quite to the contrary, current spot holdings and flows on-chain continue to display to be constructive characteristics, rather than a mass exit driven by fear or panic.

Uncertainty Priced in for March Rate Hikes
As Bitcoin derivative markets mature and liquidity deepens, we can draw increasingly useful information from futures and options pricing. Across all of the exchanges we track, the futures term structure has flattened out through to March, coincident with the expected rate hikes proposed by the Federal Reserve. This speaks to a clear investor uncertainty regarding the wider economic impact of a tighter US dollar, given the preceding decades of loose monetary policy.
Futures out to the end of 2022 are currently trading with a very modest 6% annualized premium, suggesting the market is quite far from anticipating a wild bullish impulse any time soon.
Live Chart
There has also been a notable de-leveraging across futures markets this week, however not a result of the infamous liquidation cascade that punctuated so many moments in 2021. The primary driver appears to be traders opting to close out their futures positions, rather than a forced sale/bid due to liquidations and volatile pricing. The market appears to be de-risking and curtailing leverage in response to the plethora of macro uncertainties.
Total futures open interest has now declined from 2.0% to 1.76% of market cap. Relative leverage of this magnitude has shown to be a considerably more stable range for the market throughout 2021, and was last reached after the 4-Dec-21 de-leveraging event.
Live Chart
We can also see a strong preference for put option protection with the Put/Call open interest ratio continuing to climb. The transition from traders favouring speculative call options, and into protective put options is quite clear following the October and November 2021 ATHs, indicative of a new regime of investor sentiment.
Live Chart
Higher put/call dominance is also apparent when looking at the open interest distribution for the 4-March contract. The market has a clear preference for puts with a strike between $38k and $40k, carrying more than 2.5x the open interest of the highest volume call option strikes, between $48k and $50k.
Overall, the pricing signals available in derivatives markets indicates a preference for protection, conservative leverage, and a cautious approach to storm clouds on the horizon. Based on both futures and options pricing, uncertainty appears to be principally centred around the impact of Fed rate hikes expected in March. Next up, we will review the performance of on-chain metrics to meld these observations with investor sentiment in spot markets.
Live Chart
Spot Supply Dynamics Remain Stable
As noted above, investor de-risking in prior Bitcoin market cycles was best expressed by the sale of coins in spot markets, as investors reducing their exposure. In this instance, we would usually expect to see a period of net coin inflows to exchanges, a phenomena that was observed from May to July 2021.
However, in the current market, we continue to see net coin outflows at a non-trivial rate. Across all exchanges we track, BTC is flowing out of reserves and into investor wallets at a rate of 42.9k BTC per month. This trend of net outflows has now been sustained for around 3-weeks, supporting the current price bounce from the recent $33.5k lows.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply has continued to hold a sideways trend, with a total supply held of around 13.341M BTC. There is almost always a consistent flow of coins maturing from Short into Long-term holder status. As such, this indicates that the degree of LTH spending is approximately equal and opposite to the degree of coin maturation.
Since the October ATH, LTHs have spent only 175k BTC on net, demonstrating a remarkably resilient cohort of hodlers, despite the prevailing macro headwinds.
Live Chart
The Short-Term Holder cohort (STHs, coins younger than ~155-days), currently hold 18.85% of the supply that is outside of exchange reserves (note: LTH supply + STH supply + exchange Balance ~ Circulating supply).
7.20% out of this 18.85% has recently returned to an unrealised profit during the price rally above $44k. This indicates that 1.178M BTC were spent (assumed to have changed hands) as prices traded between $33.5k and $44.0k. In other words, 7.2% of the coin supply held outside exchanges has been re-accumulated over the last three weeks, providing an indication of underlying demand in the current price range.
Live Chart
Miners also continue to display an intriguing preference for coin accumulation or distribution. The chart below presents two different cohorts of miners, whom have divergent behaviour in their treatment of mined supply:
BinancePool (blue)
has been a strong net accumulator of mined coins since mid-2020, having amassed a reserve of 33.2k BTC. However throughout 2022, miners associated with BinancePool have been spending in semi-regular tranches of between 1.2k and 1.6k BTC.
All other miners and pools (orange)
have been much heavier distributors throughout 2020-21, with aggregate balances reaching multi-year lows of around 690k BTC in Oct-Nov last year. Countering the recent spends by BinancePool, this miner cohort have added between 5k to 7k BTC to their aggregate reserves in 2022.
Overall, miner balances are climbing in aggregate, however the chart below demonstrates that the majority of this accumulated supply is driven by miners associated with BinancePool.
Live Chart
We can also investigate large wallet holdings, often referred to as whales, to see if there is a net accumulation or distribution in play. However, it is important to note that interpretation of 'whale holdings' requires a very nuanced analysis approach, and is rarely as straight forward as watching changes in an aggregate wallet cohort.
The chart below presents two curves, reflecting wallet balances of millions of USD in value:
Supply held by entities with 100-1k BTC (teal)
Supply held by entities with 1k-10k BTC (dark blue)
What we can see is an almost equal and opposite change in total supply held in these two cohorts throughout 2021. As the supply held by 1k-10k cohorts declined by 520k BTC, the supply held by 100-1k cohorts increased by 488k BTC. Finer grained analysis would reveal whether these coins were bought, sold, or simply reconfigured into a greater number of smaller value UTXOs.
In aggregate however, through the course of 2021-22, this leaves a net of -32k BTC that migrated out of these wallet cohorts. This is arguably a small coin volume when spread over a year long process of redistribution, and also relative to the present monthly rate of exchange outflows (42.9k BTC/mth).
Live Chart
In summary this week, it appears that investors are deleveraging and utilising derivatives markets to hedge out risk, and buy downside protection, with a keen eye on the Fed rate hikes expected in March. Meanwhile, overall on-chain supply dynamics appear to be in a form of equilibrium. Both Long- and Short-Term holder supplies are range-bound, miner balances are on aggregate flat to slightly higher over the last few weeks, and whale supply (100-10k BTC wallets) have been flat since December.
Unlike previous Bitcoin cycles, the sale of spot holdings does not appear to be the preferred de-risking strategy. This reflects an increasingly mature market, with a growing suite of derivative instruments available for risk managers.
Weekly Feature: New Bitcoin Supply Metrics
As Bitcoin market dynamics change over time, analysts must pay attention to a growing set of 'locations' where Bitcoin may be locked up, and flow in/out of. The section below introduces a number of new metrics available on Glassnode Studio to track various concentrations of Bitcoin supply.
There are now three Bitcoin ETFs trading in Canada:
The Bitcoin Fund QBTC.U (orange)
Purpose Bitcoin ETF (purple)
Coinshares BTCQ.U (pink)
Collectively, these ETFs now hold a total of 62,628 BTC, representing 0.33% of the circulating supply, with the Purpose ETF representing 47.6% of the total.
Live Chart
The wrapping of Bitcoin into wBTC for use within the Ethereum ecosystem has been in impressively high demand, having now absorbed 271,167 BTC, over 1.43% of circulating supply. wBTC supply has expanded by 140% since the start of 2021, growing by 158.2k BTC.
Live Chart
Finally, as the long-running Mt Gox rehabilitation proceedings continue, metrics presenting the balance of coins held by the Mt Gox Trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, are now live. After a series of sale tranches in 2017-18, the total balance of coins controlled by the Mt Gox Trustee currently stands at 137,890 BTC, equal to 0.72% of the circulating supply. This metric will respond in the event any of the coins held are spent and moved by the Trustee.

Weakness in both Bitcoin, and traditional markets, reflects the persistent risk and uncertainty associated with Fed rate hikes expected in March, fears of conflict in Ukraine, as well as growing civil unrest in Canada and elsewhere.
As the prevailing downtrend deepens, the probability of a more sustained bear market can also be expected to increase, as recency bias and the magnitude of investor losses weighs on sentiment. The longer that investors are underwater on their position, and the further they fall into an unrealized loss, the more likely those held coins will be spent and sold.
As such, we will focus this newsletter on the 'potential sell-side energy' that remains within the coin supply, primarily the volume of supply held at an unrealized loss, and whom it is held by.

The Bear Market Channel
One of the distinct signals of bearish Bitcoin markets is a lack of on-chain activity. This can be identified using tools such as Active Addresses/Entities as a proxy for users, or via blockspace demand metrics such as Transaction Counts, and On-chain Fees spent as users bid for inclusion in the next block.
The chart below presents the number of Active Entities using the Bitcoin network over the last 5yrs.
Bull markets
can be clearly identified as periods of growing demand from users, typically with an increasing number of active entities during each subsequent bullish impulse (net user growth).
Bear markets
are characterised as periods of relatively low network activity, and diminished interest from retail, marked out in the red channel below. The lower-bound of this channel has historically increased in near-linear fashion, suggesting that the pool dependable Bitcoin users (the HODLers) is still growing over the long-term.
This week however the degree of on-chain activity is languishing at the lower-bound of the bear market channel, which can hardly be interpreted as a signal of increased interest and demand for the asset.
Live Chart
Supporting this observation is the 30-day change in non-zero balance addresses. Whilst a relatively crude measure of user-base demand, periods of high demand and supply accumulation are usually accompanied by an increase in UTXO creation, and growth in non-zero address counts (and vice-versa).
Whilst the ¬†macro trend in non-zero balance address creation is upwards, over the last 30-days, there has been a softening of the trend. This is the result of some investors emptying their address balances completely. Over the last month, around 219k addresses (0.54% of the total) have been emptied, which is a metric to watch in case this is the start of a period of net outflows of users from the network (as was seen in May 2021).
Live Workbench Chart
A probable cause for this spending behaviour is associated with the financial cost, and psychological pain of holding an underwater investment. We can see in the chart below that the proportion of on-chain entities in profit is oscillating between 65.78% and 76.7% of the network.
The flip side of this observation is that more than a quarter of all network entities are now underwater on their position. Furthermore, approximately 10.9% of the network has a cost basis between $33.5k and $44.6k, with many of them purchasing in recent weeks. If the market fails to establish a sustainable uptrend, these users are statistically the most likely to become yet another a source of sell-side pressure, especially if price trades below their cost basis.
Live Chart
Long and Short-Term Holder Losses Mount
One of the primary tools we use to assess the probability of a coin being spent (and assumed sold) is lifespan, defined as the time since the coin was last moved on-chain. On a statistical basis, the longer a coin remains dormant, the more likely it is to remain dormant.
This leads into our definition of Long-Term (> 155-day, blue) and Short-Term (< 155-day, red) holders, which is a representation of coins that have a low and high probability of being spent and sold, respectively.
Using these cohorts, we can break down the distribution of prices where each coin in the supply was last moved. We do this to assess price levels associated with a large cluster of investor cost basis. What stands out is the high concentration of supply held by STHs between $42k and $50k.
With prices currently trading underneath the lower end of this range, and alongside dwindling on-chain activity, the coins held by this price sensitive cohort market represent a likely source of sell-side pressure, unless balanced by an equivalent influx of demand.
New Content: Short-Term Holder Shake-out
In case you missed it, our latest video analysis attempts to isolate which on-chain cohorts are the most likely source of sell-side pressure in the current environment. We analyse Short-Term Holders in particular using supply dynamics and spending behaviours.
As a gauge of just how underwater Short-Term Holders are, we can calculate the STH Realized Price (aggregate cost basis) by dividing price by the STH-MVRV Ratio (result in blue). This indicates that STHs have an average on-chain cost basis of $47.2k, which at the time of writing (BTC price $38.1k) is an average unrealized loss of -19.3%.
Furthermore, the STH realised price is currently trading above the
Liveliness Price
($38.6k) which reflects an estimate of 'HODLer Fair Value'. In both the 2013-14, and 2018 bear markets, when STHs hold coins well above this fair value estimate, it has signalled that the bearish trend has some time left in it to reestablish a price floor.
Live Workbench Chart
The STH-NUPL metric presents the magnitude of losses held by these Short-Term holders in proportion to the Bitcoin Market Cap. Here we can see that STHs have been underwater, in aggregate, since 4-Dec-2021. The total unrealized losses held by STHs is currently equal to 17.9% of Bitcoin's Market Cap.
At the recent price lows of $33.5k, STH-NUPL reached -39.2%, a level of extremely poor supply profitability, and a level that is rarely exceeded outside the deepest of sell-offs during bear markets. STHs have held coins at a loss for over 2 months now, which could be argued to be a sign of resilience, but should equally be considered a probable source of overhead resistance.
Live Chart
Looking at both cohorts, we can see a near even split in supply held at a loss between LTHs and STHs. Note that the supply percentages shown below are in proportion to the total supply that is not held in exchange balances (termed Sovereign Supply).
STH supply in loss is currently 15.6% of Sovereign Supply (2.56M BTC).
LTH supply in loss is currently ¬†13.1% of Sovereign Supply (2.14M BTC).
The total magnitude of coin supply held in an unrealized loss is now higher than it was during the May-July 2021 period, but is only half as severe as the worst phase of the 2018 bear market, and March 2020 flush-out.
Nevertheless, with 28.7% of Sovereign Supply currently underwater (4.70M BTC), which again poses headwinds for to bulls to establish a compelling market recovery.
Live Chart
Shifting our focus to the Long-Term Holders, we can review the LTH-SOPR metric to assess the profitability of coins that are being spent on-chain by this cohort.
Higher values of LTH-SOPR
indicate greater profits realized, typically observed near bull market peaks.
Lower values of LTH-SOPR
indicate diminished profitability of spent coins, usually the combined result of bearish price action, and lower aggregate LTH cost basis (155-days ago, the market price was ~$40k)
At present, LTH-SOPR is returning a relatively low value of 1.46, suggesting that the coins that are being spent by LTHs are realizing a fairly modest 46% profit on aggregate. Historically, declining LTH-SOPR values are characteristic of macro sideways, to bearish market trends.
Live Chart
Using this concept of LTH-SOPR as a 'realized profit multiple', we can therefore estimate the LTH Spent Price (pink). This model reflects the average price at which today's spent LTH coins, were accumulated in the past.
This model is currently trading at $28.5k, which is very near the midpoint between the LTH Realized Price (LTH cost basis), and the Liveliness Price (HODLer 'Fair Value'). Once again, this style of behaviour is indicative of a lack of macro-direction in the market, and was seen particularly throughout the 2019-20 bear market.
Perhaps this leaves room for a final capitulation event where LTH Spent Price falls back to the LTH Realized Price. Or perhaps the general trend of LTHs holding their spot coin supply and using derivatives to hedge risk makes for a more constructive bear than we have seen in the past.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Overall, the Bitcoin market has numerous bearish headwinds in play, ranging from very weak on-chain activity (a proxy for demand), to large volumes of supply held at a loss (potential sell-side). With a total of 4.70M BTC currently underwater, and 54.5% of it held by STHs whom are statistically more likely to spend it, the bulls certainly have their work cut out for them.
However, despite the prevailing drawdown that has been in play for over three months, the underlying supply dynamics remain markedly more constructive that previous bears. As was covered in the last three WoC editions (weeks
5
,
6
and
7
), Bitcoin investors appear far more likely to hold on for dear life (HODL), and use derivatives to hedge risk, rather than selling spot to reduce exposure.
It looks like a bear market. But do keep in mind, that longer term, the bear authors the bull that follows.

As a global macro asset, and with markets that never close, the price of Bitcoin was quite volatile in response. This week the market traded down to a low of $34,474, before rapidly recovering to a high of $39,917.
Having now been in a drawdown from the November ATH for 138-days, the conviction of many Bitcoin investors, mostly those whom bought near the top, has been significantly challenged this week. In this edition, we will analyse what looks like a flush out of top buyers, and draw comparisons between current market structure and the May-July 2021 period.
What we will observe is that top buyers have almost completely capitulated now. However, the remaining distribution of holders appear to be of a far higher resolve, arguably reflecting the unwavering conviction of the buyers of last resort: Bitcoin HODLers.

We will start this analysis with a deep dive on the URPD metric, which shows the distribution of coin supply at the price it last moved on-chain. What we wish to explore here are the similarities and differences between investor behaviour during this drawdown, to the similar scale one in May-July 2021.
We will analyse the URPD metric from four dates:
10-May-2021 just before the liquidation cascade sell-off event
20-July-2021 at the $29k low before the rally to ATH in late 2021
9-Nov-2021 at the current market all-time-high
27-Feb-2022 at the time of writing.
Starting with the May-July period, the coin distribution was skewed to be very top-heavy, with a large proportion of the coin supply held between $54k and $60k. Whilst this showed a degree of demand at higher prices, it also made for a fragile market with many 'top buyers' who would be sensitive to any major price correction.
Live Chart (10-5-2021)
What eventuated was a major market capitulation. Both spot and derivative markets were flushed of all exuberance, the on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network collapsed, and it can be reasonably argued that this was the start of the present bear market.
During this 2.5 month long period of consolidation, a great deal of supply was transferred by top buyers into exchanges for sale. This supply was then gradually soaked up by higher conviction buyers, with the cost basis of these coins becoming more heavily weighted between in the $29k to $40k price range.
This behaviour describes a broad scale weak hand to strong hand redistribution event.
Live Chart (20-July-2021)
Moving to the present market correction, and we can see a remarkably even distribution of the coin supply was established during the rally from July 2021, into the Nov ATH. This distribution indicates the following:
Many investors who accumulated in the May-July correction took profits on the way back up. This created volume nodes around $35k, $47k and $62k.
Buyers saw value and entered the market throughout the August to November rally. This is despite on-chain activity indicating that the majority of 'market tourists' had left, and only the HODLers remained.
Live Chart (9-11-2021)
This brings us to the present day, where we can see that much of this evenly distributed supply from November remains in place. Despite a 50%+ correction, these investors have not liquidated their positions.
Furthermore, the primary redistribution appears to be coming from investors who bought the $60k+ range around the all-time-high, which has found new owners around the current price range of $35k to $38k.
This spending behaviour describes a market dominated by price insensitive HODLers, who appear unwilling to liquidate their coins, even if held at a loss. Meanwhile top buyers have been significantly flushed out, and represent a far smaller proportion of the investor cohort when compared to May-July 2021.
Live Chart
Top Buyers May Have Already Capitulated
The news events of this week are world changing. If there was to be a time that Bitcoin investors would capitulate, especially those who see it as a risk-on asset, the break out of kinetic war would be a likely catalyst.
However, the degree of on-chain capitulation that occurred during this week's sell-off was lacklustre to say the least. In fact it exhibits similar characteristics to the 20-July-2021 sell-off to $29k (Point 3 below) which simply didn't have the bearish follow through to break prices down to new lows.
This week saw a net realized losses of $713M which is significantly less than the $2.0B+ capitulation events experienced earlier in the correction.
Live Chart
We have also seen a persistent decline in the number of investors depositing to exchanges (pink), falling from 74k /day at the Nov ATH, down to 41k/day today. Meanwhile, exchange withdrawals are holding very steady at around 40k to 48k/day, again indicative of a consistent pool of HODLers withdrawing rain, hail, or shine.
Live Workbench Chart
Of course the number of exchange deposits or withdrawals is only part of the picture, and it is the volume carried by each that helps establish the balance between of supply and demand.
The chart below shows a 30-day EMA of exchange net flows and we can see that since July, the market has favoured coin withdrawals (red, outflows). The trend in exchange outflows has softened over this time, however we still have not seen inflows anywhere close to that experienced in May-July last year, even with all the macro headwinds that are in play.
The current market does not appear to have lost confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset.
Live Chart
We can also see this in the revived supply metric looking at the volume of coins older than 1yr that were spent this week. If there was widespread loss of conviction amongst the Bitcoin HODLer cohort, we would expect this metric to see a significant uptick.
However this has not eventuated yet, and revived supply remains below 5k BTC/day which is fairly typical of previous accumulation periods.
Live Chart
There is one cohort who have dominated on-chain spending to exchanges over the last few weeks; the investors who bought the dip, only to find out that there were many more dips to come. Investors with coins aged younger than 3months have dominated at loss spending over the last 30-days. The spending of these young coins have realized a collective loss of -0.05% of the market cap per day for the last month, commensurate with bear market lows through the first half of 2018.
With the exception of June-July last year, widespread market bottoms are usually characterised by a mass exit of both new and old investors, as broad scale fear takes hold.
Given we have not seen a similar long-term holder capitulation yet, perhaps Bitcoin HODLers are built differently this time? Or, perhaps there is yet another painful dip to come to flush absolutely all remaining sellers out of the market.
This is an early look at an unreleased chart from the Glassnode Engine Room.
Strong Hands Keep Stacking
With top buyers largely flushed out of the network, and evidence it is a HODLer dominated market, we will close out with three charts that help describe what this long-time horizon cohort may be doing.
First up is Illiquid Supply, which tracks the volume of coins held in wallets with little to no history of spending. These often represent cold storage and the wallets of HODLers who withdraw religiously whilst undertaking a dollar-cost average style strategy.
As a proportion of circulating supply, Illiquid Supply has now surpassed the May 2021 peak, reaching 76.3%. This has now returned to the same level as the 2017 market top, reversing a four year long increase in coin wallet liquidity. Note however that both of these instances preceded major sell-off events, an thus it remains to be seen if these coins are truly in cold storage.
Live Chart
Telling a similar story, the Realized Cap HODL wave bands older than 3mths are pushing to new local highs of 72%. This means that 72% of the USD value 'stored in Bitcoin', is held by coins 3mths and older.
This is typical of bear markets where long-term investors see value and simultaneously slow their spending (as was seen in Revived Supply above). Note that much of this recent uplift is driven by the 3m-6m old age band in orange at the bottom. These are coins that are in approaching or in process of crossing the Short-to-Long-Term Holder boundary of 155-days (~5mths).
Live Chart
And finally, to demonstrate just how much coin volume has been absorbed by HODLers over the last 3 months, we look at the coin volume crossing the 3mth+ age threshold over the last 30-days.
At present, over 335k BTC are maturing to 3mth+ ages per 30-days, which is 12.2x the daily coin issuance to miners. A similar magnitude of HODLing behaviour was observed in mid-2020, and Jun-Sept 2021, both of which preceded powerful upside moves.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The current market is extremely interesting from both an on-chain, and a macro perspective. Given the enormous magnitude of uncertainty and risk that a kinetic conflict introduces, must be prudent with an expectation of further de-risking, investor panic, and capitulation events. So far however, we have not seen a widespread capitulation event, with exception of very short-term holders whom purchased the ATH or premature dips during this drawdown. Keep note that many signals of 'hype demand' remain well below bull market levels (
covered last week
).
Despite this very uncertain macro and geopolitical backdrop, the behaviour of Bitcoin HODLers maintain a remarkably bullish conviction. Coins continue to be withdrawn from exchanges, are moving into increasingly illiquid wallets, and are maturing into increasingly senior age bands at a high rate. These look like Long-Term Holder coins in the making.
It is now key to watch in case these coherent trends begin to reverse, which may signal broad-scale loss of confidence. However in lieu of such a reversal, these observations continue to paint a favourable and constructive future for Bitcoin, somewhere over the horizon.

As the global macro and geopolitical stage continues to create uncertainty in markets, Bitcoin bulls attempt to set a price floor. The bulls have been absorbing a modest but persistent sell-side pressure for over two-months now, largely sourced from by short-term holder divestment.
With prices trading sideways in recent weeks, a relative equilibrium has been established. However, given the limited incoming fresh demand, this delicate balance can be disrupted by any significant degree of seller exhaustion, or conversely a re-invigoration of sellers.
Thus the question to be answered is whether the capital support being provided by the bulls will be sufficient to keep the bears at bay. As such, in this edition, we will assess the current on-chain volume space, with a specific focus on flows into exchanges. This aims to best reflect the magnitude of sell-side pressure and investor divestment.

A Tale of Two Exchanges
Monitoring of exchange activity is a powerful strategy within on-chain analysis, although it does require an appreciation of data mutability (
covered here
). The tracking of aggregate exchange flows, especially over longer time periods (months), provides useful insight the balance of supply and demand.
To start, we will note of the following high level nuances for interpreting exchange balance metrics:
Bitcoin HODLers (of all wallet sizes)
tend to be fairly religious regarding self-custody, and are thus the most likely cohort to withdraw their coins.
Newer retail level market entrants
are the far less likely to withdraw coins, preferring the simplicity of custody solutions, and trading options provided by exchanges.
Institutional treasuries
are similarly likely to take advantage of exchange custody solutions or similar), preferring the expertise and risk management offered by such firms. These coins are also more likely to be traded via OTC desks and held in specialised multi-signature arrangements.
With the proliferation of derivatives markets
, Bitcoin units can also be used as collateral, and thus exchange inflows may also be a result of providing additional coin margin.
Note that 3-of-4 of the above characteristics have a skew towards exchange inflows. This is in part what makes the aggregate outflow of 575,876 BTC from exchanges (3.655% of supply) since the March 2020 sell-off so impressive. Note also how a relative equilibrium has been established since September 2021.
Live Chart
During the highly volatile macro and geopolitical events of the last few weeks, exchange net-flow volumes are also reasonably stable, despite a slight bias towards inflows this week. Around 1k BTC per day in net inflows deposited to exchanges this week, with Bitfinex and FTX receiving the lions share.
This magnitude of presumes sell-side supply remains fairly modest, particularly given the global macro context.
Live Chart
Over the last year in particular, exchanges have more-or-less fallen into two dominant camps based on their balance change: those with
Net Inflows
, and those with
Stable Balances to Net Outflows
.
Specifically, Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex and FTX have seen non-trivial growth in their held Bitcoin reserves. In combination, these exchanges have seen combined BTC inflows of 207k BTC since the end of July 2021, a growth of 24.3%.
Live Chart
The other camp includes the remaining exchanges we monitor, and has seen a collective outflow of 253k BTC since late-July. Of these exchanges, Huobi (purple) represents by far the largest overall decline, having fallen from over 400k BTC in March 2020, to just 12.3k BTC today. More than half of this balance decline has occurred following the Chinese government ban on Bitcoin mining, and further restrictions placed on investor activity in May last year.
Live Chart
FTX and Binance in particular stand-out in this study, having seen extraordinary growth in market share dominance (measured by relative BTC balance held). Note that both Binance and FTX host a diverse range of spot and derivative products, and thus it is likely a reasonable proportion of BTC held is being used as margin collateral.
The total volume of BTC held by FTX is currently estimated to be 103.2k BTC, which is extraordinary growth from the mere 3k BTC held in March 2020. This represents a balance dominance increase from 0.8% in July 2021 to 4.0% today.
If we remove the BTC held by FTX from the total exchange balance metric (result in pink), we can see this measure of aggregate exchange balances is probing new multi-year lows, showing the sizeable footprint FTX now has.
Live Workbench Chart
Binance however takes the crown for most impressive growth in market share dominance, rising from a relatively stable 8% BTC balance dominance in 2018-20, to over 22.6% today. The total balance held on Binance has increased by 315k BTC since March 2020, an increase of 120% in just two years.
Live Workbench Chart
Alongside BTC balance growth, both Binance and FTX have seen their dominance over Futures markets more than double since Dec 2020. Binance's share of Future OI has increased from 15% to 30%, whilst FTX has risen from 6.7% to over 14.8% (a 2.2x increase).
Live Chart
The increase in Futures volume dominance is even more impressive, with Binance now representing half of all traded futures volume. FTX has seen a similarly impressive increase in volume dominance, rising by 2.5x since Dec-2020 to now capture 9.2% of traded futures volume.
Live Chart
Our high level conclusions from this study of exchange activity:
Net inflows remain relatively small given then scale of market uncertainty at present, and overall exchange balances appear to be in equilibrium.
There are two cohorts of exchanges with respect to BTC balance change over the last year.
Binance and FTX represent the stand-out exchanges in market share increase over the last two year, both of which have a corresponding increase in futures market dominance.
This suggests a preference of investors to use derivatives to hedge risk, rather than the sale of spot BTC, an observation which corroborates our report from
Week 7
.
Characterising Exchange Inflow Volumes
Having now explored the relative equilibrium of exchange balances, we can now look to explore the investor profile of coins being sent to exchanges. To start, we will analyse three estimates of investor cost basis (realized prices) to inform our interpretation of sentiment and the likelihood of a sale:
The Short-Term Holder
realized price
is currently trading at $46.4k, and thus holds an aggregate unrealized loss of 15%. This metric is a reflection of all coins that were moved within the last 155-days.
The HODLer Implied Price
is currently at break-even ($39.2k), and reflects an estimate of 'fair value'. It is calculated by weighting the standard realized price by the degree of accumulation and HODLing behaviour.
The Realized Price
is currently at $24.1k, and is the average price of all coins valued when they were last moved on-chain. Historically, this has been a very sound cycle support level, and suggests that the aggregate market is still holding an unrealized profit of 63% (heavily weighted by longer-term investors with a lower cost basis).
Live Chart
One obvious thesis from this is that:
Short-Term Holders (STHs) are the most likely to sell since they are underwater on their position.
Conversely, Long-Term holders (LTHs) are more likely to be in profit, and thus are less likely to sell.
The next chart shows the shows the degree of profit or loss realized by STHs on coins sent to exchanges. We can see that non-trivial daily losses have been sustained for over two months, equivalent to of around 0.5% of the Market Cap per day. Whilst significant, losses of this magnitude are nowhere near the extreme capitulation levels seen in the 2018 bear market, March 2020, or in May 2021.
This largely confirms our first observation that STHs are creating sell-side pressure, although it is of much lower magnitude than has been seen in previous bear cycles.
Unreleased Metric from the Glassnode Engine Room
Similarly, the chart below shows the profit or loss realized by LTHs sending to exchanges. We can see that the degree of spending has been in decline since Jan 2021, which confirms our second observation that LTHs comprise a small portion of sell-side activity. Note that we are yet to see a major LTH capitulation event as was seen at previous cyclical bottoms.
The historically low magnitude of both STH and LTH losses may be signalling increasing probabilities of aggregate seller exhaustion. However, the risk of a final, and complete capitulation of both STHs and LTHs should remain on the radar, and has numerous historical precedents.
Unreleased Metric from the Glassnode Engine Room
The proportion of on-chain volume that is in profit is also near historically low levels, reaching 47.5% this week. Flipping this observation around, we can deduce that over half (52.5%) of all transaction volume is currently spent at a loss. For context, final stages of previous bear cycles (marked in red) were punctuated by over 55% of all transfer volume being in loss (capitulation events).
Live Chart
To close out, we look to the 30-day change in the Realized Cap. This metric indicates the total magnitude of profit/loss across the network, mapped out as a statistical deviation from the long-term average (Z-Score).
What we see is that investor losses during this bear market are statistically significant, extending 1 standard deviation below the mean. Realized losses of this magnitude are coincident with all significant bear market lows (local and global) over the last 5-years.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The current drawdown is historically significant across a number of on-chain metrics and measures, despite being shallower (-50%) than past bear markets (-85%). This describes characteristics that are similar to previous late-stage bear market trends. However whilst the degree of on-chain 'panic selling' is significant on a statistical basis, it is notably lower relative to market size.
The investors who are divesting are preferring to sell coins that are held at a loss, an activity which has been dominated by Short-Term Holders. Meanwhile Long-Term Holder sell-side has continued to decline since Jan 2021 a signal of growing conviction in the face of high macro uncertainty.
With the introduction of derivative markets, FTX and Binance in particular have seen significant increases in market share. This adds another data-point to the market's utilisation of futures to hedge risk, rather than the sale of spot BTC to reduce exposure.

As was covered in the previous edition, the market currently exists in a delicate balance, amidst a backdrop of high macro and geopolitical uncertainty playing out on the global stage.
We are now two years on from the major capitulation event in March 2020 that saw Bitcoin prices plummet over 52%, fall from $8k to $3.8k in two trading days, and marked the end of the 2019-20 bear cycle. Capitulation events like this often signify a complete and total flush out of all remaining sellers, turning the tides in the favour of the bulls.
In this edition, we will assess the current balance between buyers and sellers in an attempt to gauge how close we may be to the end of the current bear cycle.
Executive Summary
Uncertainty and macro risks are a current headwind, which are manifesting as softened short-term accumulation trends.
Spending by older coins over the last week is also marginally more bearish than recent weeks, although is still not at levels that signify widespread fear or loss of conviction.
82% of the supply held by Short-Term Holders (2.51M BTC) is currently held at an unrealised loss, whilst total supply held by Long-Term Holders is near all-time-highs.
Despite weaker short-term demand, HODLing remains the preferred strategy, with the proportion of younger coins now at all-time-lows. This is historically associated with late stage bear markets.
We introduce a new concept called
market inflation rate
which shows that on an annualised basis, Long-Term Holders are adding to their balance at a volume 7.6x larger than mining issuance. This is constructive longer-term.

Uncertainty Softens Short-Term Accumulation
To set the stage, we begin with a metric newly released this week, the
Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score
. This tool is designed to monitor the big picture aggregate accumulation, or distribution of investor wallets. This tool tracks when large entities (aka whales) and/or large portions of the market (aka shrimps in large numbers) are adding to their coin holdings, whilst also filtering out miners and exchanges.
The metric trades between values of 0 and 1 with the following interpretation:
Values closer to 0 (yellow/orange)
indicate the market is distributing, or there is little meaningful accumulation taking place (bearish).
Values closer o 1 (purple)
indicate that the market is in net accumulation with investor wallet balances increasing meaningfully (bullish).
We can see that the period from October 2021 to Jan 2022 was one of very strong accumulation (> 0.9, dark purple), likely by price insensitive HODLers. However, for most of 2022, this metric has fluctuated between a value of 0.2 and 0.5. This highlights the impact of global macro uncertainty on investor sentiment, with weaker accumulation taking place as a result.
Live Chart
We have also released a video guide to the Accumulation Trend Score below.
This week we have also seen a notable increase in older coins being spent. Older coins are held by investors who have more experience with the characteristic volatility of Bitcoin markets, and are often considered synonymous with 'smarter money'.
As such, when we see older coins being spent at higher levels, it can indicate a more bearish tilt in sentiment within the HODLer class. Coins older than 6mths represented 5% of all spending volume this week, which is a notable uptick from recent months.
Live Chart
We can also see this in the Binary Coin-days Destroyed metric with a 7-day moving average applied. This metric will trade higher when older coins are spent in a sustained manner. Low values (green zones) are typical of accumulation phases in a bear market, whilst elevated values (red zones) are typical of bullish trends, as long-term investors sell into market strength.
Since September last year, Binary CDD has traded consistently higher than a typical accumulation phase. This further suggests that there remains some degree of long-term investor de-risking taking place.
Live Chart
The unit we measure to track the aggregate age of coins being spent is called a coin-day. It represents the amount of time a coin has remained dormant in an investor wallet. On a more macro view, the aggregate sum of coin-day destruction over the last 90-days remains historically low.
During bear markets, the CDD-90 metric trades at low levels as investors slowly accumulate coins and there is an aggregate preference for HODLing. It will however spike higher following capitulation events, as fear and panic creates a final wave of sell-side pressure, which exhausts all remaining bears.
This metric does suggest that accumulation and HODLing is the preferred behaviour pattern at present. We have yet to see a final capitulation event in this bear cycle however, which has happened in all previous cycles. It remains to be seen if this time is different.
Live Chart
Short-Term Supply Shrinks
The chart below shows the relative proportion of the coin supply held by Short-Term Holders (STHs) who accumulated within the last 155-days. This cohort are statistically the most likely to sell their coins in the face of market volatility, especially during a final capitulation flush out.
Supporting our observations above, we continue to see the amount of coin supply held by the Short-Term Holder cohort decline. This can only occur when large portions of the coin supply are dormant and crossing the 155-day age threshold, becoming Long-Term Holder supply. STH supply reaching low levels is historically associated with the later stages of bear markets, as patient buyers send coins to cold storage for the long hold.
STH supply is currently near all-time-lows which is constructive for prices. However, 82% of these coins (2.51M BTC) are currently held at a loss, and are in turn the most likely source of sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
The HODL waves are also showing that coins younger than 6-months old are at all-time-lows. 24.53% of the circulating supply is in this young age cohort, which means that 75.47% of the supply has remained dormant for more than 6-months.
This is again a relatively constructive observation for prices and indicates that HODLing is dominating investor behaviour, even with the prevailing macro risks as headwinds.
Live Chart
Whilst a the proportion of young coin supply is declining, it holds an increasingly large proportion of the realised value compared to previous cycles. In other words, an increasingly large amount of the USD denominated capital invested in Bitcoin is currently held in coins accumulated in the last 6-months.
Late stage bear markets are similarly characterised by lower proportions of capital held by these younger coins, as coins mature in longer-term investor wallets. The 3m-6m age band in particular (top yellow band in chart below) is currently swelling significantly, indicating that a large volume of the supply purchased between September and December last year remains held tightly.
Live Chart
Signs of Long-Term Demand Persist
Having now established a macro context of sell-side supply, we now look towards signals of longer range demand (3mths+).
Coinbase in particular has seen a very large net outflow this week, totalling 31,130 BTC ($1.18B). This is the largest net outflow since 28-July-2017. The regime of net outflows (red bars) following March 2020 is also quite apparent in the chart below. This remains a strong signal that investors increasingly see Bitcoin as a relevant asset in modern portfolios.
Live Chart
This outflow has dropped the total balance held on Coinbase to 649.5k BTC, bringing it back to levels last seen at the 2017 bull market top. The total Bitcoin balance held by Coinbase has now declined by 375.5k BTC (36.6%) from the ATH reached in April 2020.
Large outflows like this one are actually part of a consistent trend in the Coinbase balance, which has been stair-stepping downwards over the last two years. As the largest exchange by BTC balance, and a preferred venue for US based institutions, this further supports the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset by larger institutions.
Live Chart
If we look at the Illiquid Supply Shock Ratio (ISSR), we can see a significant uptick this week, suggesting that these withdrawn coins have been moved into a wallet with little-to-no history of spending.
This metric will trend higher as more coins move into such wallets, and we can see that it currently has a similar market structure to the 2018-20 bear market, albeit on a shorter time scale. The ISSR metric is currently at 3.2, which means that the amount of supply held in Illiquid wallets is 3.2x larger than Liquid and Highly Liquid supply combined.
This metric does indicates that a persistent demand is present, despite struggling prices.
Live Chart
To close, we introduce a concept that has been recently developed in collaboration with
David Puell
(Ark Invest) that we call the '
market inflation rate
'. This metric is a measure of annualised accumulation or distribution rates by LTHs.
First we consider Bitcoin issuance to miners relative to circulating supply as the
nominal inflation rate
(yellow trace), which is assumed to be a persistent sell-side pressure.
Next we annualised the daily change in Long-Term Holder supply relative to circulating supply as a measure of market demand. We multiply the value by negative 1 such that LTH accumulation will return a negative rate (bullish), whilst LTH divestment will return a positive rate (bearish).
Finally, we add this LTH accumulation rate to the nominal inflation rate to calculate the
market inflation rate
(green trace). What we can see is:
During late stage bear markets
, market inflation rates are deeply negative (available supply is deflationary), hitting -14% to -15%. This means LTHs are accumulating ~15% of the circulating supply per year over and above miner issuance.
At bull market tops
, market inflation peaks above nominal inflation, indicating that LTHs are adding significantly to sell-side pressure via divestment (available supply is very inflationary). This ultimately leads to an oversupply and initiates a bear market.
At present, the LTH market inflation rate is at -10.9%, which means LTHs are currently adding to their balance at 7.6x the rate of issuance. This is approaching historical lows that have signalled bear market lows in past cycles, and is another constructive long-term undertone.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Uncertainty associated with the many macro and geopolitical risks risks have weakened shorter-term on-chain accumulation trends since January. We can also see marginally elevated spending by older coins this week, although it is still not suggestive of any widespread loss of investor conviction on a macro scale.
With over 2.51M BTC held by Short-term Holders at an unrealised loss, there remains a risk that sellers have not yet been fully exhausted. The 'potential energy' for a capitulation event is there, and such an event would be consistent with all prior bear cycles.
However, HODLing does continue to dominate investor behaviour, and the longer-term accumulation trends are still impressively constructive.

As prices trade within this narrow range, and volatility is squeezed out of the market, the odds of higher volatility in the near-term builds.
In this edition, we will focus on three core areas of the market, in an attempt to characterise the most likely mechanisms driving the next major move in the market:
Geographical dominance of buy and sell-side pressure using a suite of newly released metrics.
On-chain activity and supply maturation metrics which describe the recovery of the network user-base in bear markets.
Derivatives markets which price in current, and future volatility, as well as provide insight into behaviours associated with risk-neutral cash and carry positioning.
Executive Summary
Current buy side demand appears to be dominated by US and EU markets, with the majority of sell-side sources during Asian trading hours.
Bitcoin network utilisation and on-chain activity remains firmly within bear market territory, albeit is recovering. A sustained upwards impulse in network activity would likely be constructive, whilst deterioration likely favours the bears.
The amount of BTC supply absorbed during the current drawdown is similar in magnitude to the period after the March 2020 sell-off. However it remains modest at best, and is a key metric to keep an eye on in coming weeks.
Derivatives markets are currently pricing in historically low implied volatility, and futures premiums. Such market structure has historically preceded periods of very high volatility, and most often to the upside.

Western Markets Bid, whilst Asia Dominates Sell-side
We released a suite of three new metrics last week, which track the cumulative 30-day price change in US, EU and Asian trading hours. These metrics provide insight into which geographic areas of the market are leading, or lagging in buy and sell-side pressure, particularly in reaction to fundamental changes in market structure.
Over the course of 2020 to 2022, US and EU markets have acted similarly with the following general structure:
General accumulation and bid support following the March 2020 sell-off
. This is likely in response to the expansionary monetary policies, and fiat currency debasement enacted by western central banks at this time.
Heavy buy side during late 2020 to early 2021 bull market
. US markets led this demand side through to January, with demand from European market bid support being heaviest in the Mar-May 2021 top.
Both regions capitulated throughout May-July,
although the US notably led buy side recovery into September. There was notably less buy side from US and EU at the November top relative to August.
Europe is providing the largest bid support at present
, although overall price changes are only moderately positive, and yet to signal the return of sustainable bull market style demand.
Live Workbench Chart
Asian markets tell a notably different story. In the chart below, we show US (blue) and EU (purple) ghost traces for ease of comparison. For Asian markets:
Primarily sell-side pressure after March 2020
, potentially signalling a very different market expectation regarding the impact COVID would have on the global economy.
Notably lower participation and buy side demand throughout Q1-Q3 of 2021,
however notably, demand in Asia peaked around the lows of bull market corrections.
Wide-scale sell-side at the lows in July 2021, with demand only peaking at the Oct-Nov All-time-highs
. All three regions 'bought the top' at this time, but Asian demand eclipsed both US and EU.
Heavy sell-side dominance during the current draw-down
, which has been sustained since December 2021, and is likely in response to heavier buy-side at the top.

Capitulation Event

The On-chain Recovery Grinds On
A useful tool-set for tracking Bitcoin demand is the analysis of on-chain activity, ranging from active addresses, new on-chain entities, transaction counts, and transfer volumes. Typically we see these style activity metrics collapse during early bear markets, and begin to signal recovery as smart-money demand increases at depressed prices.
Note that a new On-chain Entity is defined as a cluster of addresses that have no association with existing clusters. This metric therefore reflects new entrants to the network, or existing entities whom are
not
interacting with their existing addresses (e.g. HODLers with good privacy practices who avoid address re-use and combining UTXOs).
We can clearly see the accelerated growth rate in new on-chain entities a bull (blue), followed by a heavy collapse at the start of a bear (pink). Bear markets are characterised by a fairly persistent grind higher in new entities entering the Bitcoin network.
The current rate of 110k new on-chain entities per day is similar to the peak of the 2019 mini-bull, and is on a modest upwards trajectory.
Live Chart
A similar trend is observable in transaction counts, although the current rate of 215k Tx/day is lower that what was observed throughout 2019.
For metrics like active addresses, new on-chain entities, and transaction counts, an accelerated growth rate higher would be a constructive signal, and likely support a healthy recovery in prices. Conversely, a deterioration in network utilisation would be a more bearish observation, and one to watch out for as a sign of demand exhaustion.
Live Chart
One piece of data that is not captured by the analysis of active addresses/entities and transaction counts is the economic weight of these network users. Where the general characteristics of the above metrics are similar to the 2019-20 bear market recovery, transaction volumes and value settlement are notably different.
The 2017 bull market top was followed by a near complete 'destruction' of the new transaction volume that pushed prices to the cycle all-time-high of $20k. Throughout 2018 and 2019, daily settlement volume languished at around $1.5B/day, a level first established in July 2017. Large size transactions (>$1M in value) represented between 10% and 30% of all volume at this time.
In the 2021-22 bear market however, total daily value settlement has continued to trend higher, as measured at the lows of both 50%+ draw-downs. Large size transactions also now represent a sustained 65% to 70% dominance.
Note that transaction volumes are currently at the lows of this established range, and a severe decline may signal a reduction in network utilisation, and would likely favour a bearish case.
Live Chart
The current drawdown has now been in play for 132-days since the Nov ATH, and the tail of our 155-day threshold used to define Long-Term Holder status is approaching the October price high. As such, we can make a broad assertion that
Long-Term Holders own coins before the market high, and Short-Term Holders own coins purchased during or after the market top
.
With this in mind, we can see that Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply holdings have stagnated since the October peak. This suggests that the volume of coins maturing into LTH status, is being met by equal spending pressure by this cohort.
Live Chart
To assess whether Short-Term holders are likely to become LTHs, we can look to the 3m-6m old HODL wave band. This age band is selected due to these coins being accumulated and HODLed through the worst phase of this drawdown. This likely increases the odds that the owners are more price insensitive (else they would have spent and redistributed already, as many have,
described in Week 9
).
The volume of coins that have now entered this age band is currently at 480k BTC, which is large on paper, but remains well below what we have seen preceding significant bullish impulses in 2019 and 2021. It is however similar to the March 2020 accumulation of 510k BTC, which is noteworthy given the scale of that economic shock is comparable to current conflict, commodity inflation, and supply chain disruptions.
Continuation of an uptrend in both of these supply held metrics would be constructive, however declines in both would suggest a lack of incoming accumulation alongside increasing spending by LTHs (Bitcoins stronger holders).
Live Chart
Derivatives Price in Volatility Ahead
In our newsletter published in mid-Feb (
Week 7
) we described how derivative markets were pricing in uncertainty and risk, largely associated with impacts of the Federal Reserve rate hike in March. With the Fed having announced an expected 0.25% to 0.5% rate hike this week, both futures and options markets are beginning to price in higher implied volatility in the short-term.
The futures market term structure remains either flat, or in backwardation for all exchanges through to April, with only a 4.46% annualised premium priced out to years-end.
Live Chart
Implied volatility priced into at-the-money options markets is also climbing in recent weeks. This is despite prices trading in a sideways range which usually lead a compression in implied volatility.
Options implied volatility is coming off relatively low levels between 60% and 80%, which have historically been followed by periods of extremely high volatility. Such high volatility events in 2021 include the May sell-off, the short-squeeze in July, and the October rally to ATHs.
Live Chart
If we look to the degree of leverage in Futures markets, we can see that open interest is on a steady ascent, reaching 1.94% of the Bitcoin market cap. Through 2021, leverage ratios of more than 2.0% of market cap have historically been high risk periods, often followed by a violent de-leveraging event (either a short or a long squeeze).
Live Workbench Chart
Note that given the relatively poor price performance of markets of late (both Bitcoin and TradFi) in recent months, there are two likely mechanisms driving this basis compression:
Risk neutral cash and carry trades, as investors seek any available positive rates of nominal return.
Short sellers and risk hedging via futures in preference to the sale of spot to reduce net exposure (
explored in the Week 7 newsletter
).
As a result of increased demand to capture futures premium during this drawdown, we can see that the 3-month rolling basis has compressed to an annualised return of just 3.5%. Basis compression to this extent has only been seen in Sept 2020, and at market the lows in June-July 2021, both of which preceded very violent upside rallies.
Live Chart
Of particular note is the open interest leverage in perpetual futures markets. Here we can see that the total value of open interest in perpetual swaps is now 1.28% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is a historically high risk zone. It also demonstrates that the market is currently preferentially deploying capital into perpetual swaps, rather than expiring futures.
Live Workbench Chart
If we calculate the annualised rolling basis from perpetual funding rates (pink), we can compare to the rate of return available from the rolling premium priced into 3-month expiring futures (blue). From this study, we can draw the following conclusions:
Perpetual futures basis are significantly more volatile than that of expiring futures
. This is likely a result of demand for leverage in an instrument that closely tracks spot markets via price indexes, and the subsequent incentive that funding rates creates for traders to take the other side of the trade.
Periods where perpetual basis trades lower than 3M basis have historically reflected periods of near-term undervaluation
(marked in green), either at the lows of bull market corrections, or during more prolonged bearish trends.
Conversely,
periods where the perpetual basis is significantly higher than 3M basis have signalled short-term market tops
when the demand for leverage in perpetual markets creates an oversupply as traders arbitrage down high funding rates.
The perpetual futures basis has now traded below 3M basis since mid-November, and is in the process of breaking above it. In combination with the above observation that 3M rolling basis is historically low, this suggests that a regime change in market structure, and higher volatility likely lies ahead.
It also suggests that a maximum number of traders are in risk neutral positions (cash and carry), and perhaps waiting for confirmation to deploy capital into a trend.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market has now been in a drawdown from the November ATH for 132-days, and prices have consolidated inside the present trading range for over 2-months. This has lead to a compression of yields available from cash-and-carry trades in futures markets, and lower implied volatility in options markets.
At the moment, we have implied volatility climbing, and leverage ratios in futures markets approaching overheated levels, particularly across perpetual futures. Market structure such as this has preceded periods of very high volatility, as was seen in May 2021, and Aug 2021, and thus suggests a regime of higher volatility may be around the corner.
On-chain activity and supply dynamics remain firmly in bear market territory in magnitude and trend, but are somewhat directionless in their forward bias. Should evidence of strength appear in the form of accelerating on-chain activity, and increased supply migrating into long-term holder hands it would favour the bulls, especially given volatility expectations. Similarly, deterioration would favour the bears.
The market spring appears to be coiled, and a period of higher volatility just over the horizon seems increasingly likely.

This is the first sustained rally after many months of sideways choppy price action.
Over the last few months, we have outlined various cases and angles that describe Bitcoins market structure as being in what is most likely a bear market, arguably commencing as far back as May 2021. However, as the market saying goes, bear markets author the bulls that follow.
The process of bottom formation and investor capitulation in a bear market is often a lengthy and painful process, and Bitcoin is by no means out of the bearish woods yet. Nevertheless, in this edition we seek to look further out, in an attempt to identify metrics that are indicate whether a constructive recovery is underway in the longer term.
Executive Summary
The proportion of coin supply aged 1yr+ is rapidly approaching all-time-highs, as coins accumulated in Q1 of the 2021 bull market remain unspent in investor wallets.
This generally signifies that Bitcoin investors maintain a strong conviction in the asset, despite the many macro and geopolitical headwinds.
Comparing these supply dynamics to past cycles, it is most likely that Bitcoin is well into the second half of the bear market.
There is however modest spending taking place by owners of more mature coins (possible smart money divestment), however heavy accumulation appears to have taken place between $35k and $42k absorbing the sell-side pressure.

Old Supply Approaches New Highs
One of the foundational tools we use to assess investor conviction in on-chain analysis is coin lifespan (or coin age). Lifespan is broadly defined as the period of time since the coin was last moved (time since UTXO creation).
Statistically speaking
, the longer a coin remains dormant, the more likely it is to remain so. Given Bitcoin's characteristic volatility, investors who hold coins for an extended period of time are more likely to experience wild price swings, and are thus more likely to be experienced, and higher conviction HODLers.
As we approach the end of Q1-2022, we can see an extraordinary increase in the proportion of coins aged 1yr+, which has risen by 9.4% of circulating supply over the last 8-months. These coins largely reflect BTC volumes accumulated in the Q1-2021 phase of the bull market and the owners have thus held through two 50%+ drawdowns, and three all-time highs. This recovery is quite similar in scale and duration to the 2018-19 recovery.
Live Chart
Whilst the chart above shows BTC volume > 1yr as a proportion of circulating supply, it is also useful to know how much USD denominated 'wealth' is held in those coins. The reality that most investors make decisions regarding portfolio allocations in relation to its fiat denominated value, and cost basis, and thus proportional USD value is very relevant.
The Realized Cap HODL waves ¬†are the ideal tool for this assessment, and the chart below is filtered for these same 1yr+ old coins. We can see the following:
Q2-Q4 of 2021 has many similarities to past bear markets
where the total wealth held in 1yr+ coins reached a cycle minimum from May to Dec 2021.
Bear Phase 1:
When a low proportion of wealth is held by older, more experienced investors, it means the converse is true, and much of the wealth is held by newer, less experienced investors, which is top formation and bear market material.
Bear Phase 2:
This wealth disparity is recovering strongly as more coins transition into 1yr+ age bands, and more wealth, with a higher cost basis is is HODLed (setting a higher floor value than the last cycle).
The current market is in the process of recovering (Phase 2), however it can be seen in past cycles, this process can take many months for a price floor to fully form, and find sustained upside momentum.
Live Chart
On-chain analysts will often consider an abundance of 'older coins' as a signal of market strength and conviction for the following reasons:
Macro increases in the aggregate lifespan of the coin supply show a desire to hold BTC, despite volatile price swings, suggesting higher investor conviction, and future value expectations.
It reflects a general reduction in 'liquid' coin supply available for marginal buyers purchase as a result of historical accumulation by 'smarter money' buyers.
The RHODL Ratio captures this behaviour into a single elegant oscillator. It calculated as the ratio between 1-week old, and 1yr-old Realized Cap HODL Wave bands. It will peak when a maximum USD wealth is held by new investors (market tops) and bottom when more of the wealth is held by 1yr age bands (market bottoms).
Here we can see a macro downtrend is in now play, reflecting the growth in 1yr+ coins moving into the metric denominator. RHODL currently describes a balance between new, and experienced HODLers that is coincident with late stage bear markets, and also with early stage bull markets. Note however that only in 2012 was RHODL in a macro downtrend, whilst market pricing was in a bull market.
Live Chart
Another oscillator that captures an impressive amount of investor psychology one elegant curve is Reserve Risk. This metric will trade at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy. Conversely, it is extremely reflexive to the upside (requires a log scale) when these experienced investors exit their positions.
Reserve Risk has traded at historically undervalued levels for 77-days so far, although this is far shorter than the multi-year periods seen in 2015-17 and 2018-20. Note however that Reserve Risk generally signals undervaluation well into the bull market as HODLers typically commence distribution only after a new price ATH is set (

Short Term Support meets Long-Term Spending
As is seen in the above metrics, the transition from bear to bull is rarely obvious at the time, and usually takes long periods of time to play out. An underlying reason for this is that even the strongest of hands may take exit liquidity during bear market rallies to conserve and maximise capital efficiency.
If we look to the Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB), we can see that a sizeable portion of the 6-month+ aged coins have increased their spending throughout March. Around 2% of all on-chain transaction volume is associated with these coins which is relatively significant.
Live Chart
This is confirmed by looking to Revived Supply 1yr+, which demonstrates that between 7k to 10k BTC aged 1yr+ have been spent per day over the last 30-days. There are two takeaway interpretations from this:
Older coins are on the move during this price consolidation, which suggests a degree of investor uncertainty, and de-risking is taking place. This is likely to create overhead supply that must be absorbed.
Market prices have not broken to new lows despite this additional sell-side pressure, suggesting that there has been sufficient demand to absorb this expenditure.
Live Chart
Returning the the Realized Cap HODL waves, we will now look to the younger coin bands, aged 1-month and less. Here we can see that around 16.23% of the USD wealth stored in Bitcoin is currently held in these younger age bands. These bands will swell only when the above older coins are spent and change hands to newer buyers.
During late stage bears, these age bands tend to reach relative minimum values, as all remaining speculators and market tourists leave the space, and smarter money accumulate coins at cheaper prices. The proportion of value held in these age bands is similar to the 'disbelief and exit liquidity' periods of 2012, 2016 and 2019-20.
Live Chart
Supporting the suite of observations above, we have the Realized Price Distribution of the current UTXO set (TA analogy: on-chain volume profile). This version is an unreleased version of the URPD that is broken into Long-term and Short-Term Holder cohorts.
What we can see two important observations:
Long-Term Holders still hold a very large proportion of supply that was acquired at higher prices
(> $45k). These coins are holding an unrealized loss, and likely have been for a number of months. It is notable that these investors are yet to liquidate, suggesting strong sentiment persists.
Short-Term Holders have accumulated a large proportion of the supply between $38k and $45k.
This indicates that many investors see the current consolidation range as a value zone, and this has similar characteristics to the $30k to $40k range of May-July 2021 (
explored in Week 29, 2021
)
Risks remain that these buyers may be sensitive to any downside volatility. However, the degree of accumulation that appears to have taken place during this consolidation range, especially in the face of world changing macro and geopolitical risks, is truly a signal of strength and conviction in Bitcoin.
Unreleased Metric from the glassnode Engine Room
Short-Term Pain for Long-Term Gain
Bitcoin bear markets have historically ended with one last major flush out. A capitulation event that shakes out even the most hardened HODLers. Examples include Jan 2015, Nov 2018, and March 2020, all of which saw Bitcoin prices drop over 50% in just a few days.
During these events, All remaining sellers are exhausted, and we typically see both profitable coins and underwater coins sold at scale. The chart below presents the degree of profit/loss realised on coins specifically sent to exchanges (most likely for sales).
We can see that we have experienced two such events in the last 12-months, although they are of notably smaller magnitude relative to the 2018-20 bear cycle. Given two 50% drawdowns in this time, it is more likely this reflects increased investor confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset on the macro stage.
Unreleased Metric from the glassnode Engine Room
The concept of 'realized value' is captured entirely within the Realized Cap, which reflects the aggregate investor cost basis for the Short-Term and Long-Term Holder cohorts. The chart below shows:
The Short-Term Holder Realized Cap (pink)
is more volatile, and typically provides resistance in a bear market (investors selling at their cost basis). It is currently trading at $45.9k. This is a key level to watch in case the market can break and hold it, which may suggest a regime shift towards greener pastures.
The Long-Term Holder Realized Cap (blue)
is much slower moving, lags the standard Realized Price (orange) by ~155-days, and rarely trends downwards.
A downtrend in the LTH Realized Cap indicates that the aggregate LTH cost basis is declining. This can only happen when
LTHs who bough the top capitulate, or
When 155-days ago LTHs accumulated large coin volumes at cheaper prices.
Given 155-days ago was the October ATH, this makes point 1) the more likely outcome, suggesting LTHs have, or are well into the process of capitulation.
Live Chart
To Finalise this observation, we introduce the LTH Realized Cap Net Position Change Z-Score. This metric:
Calculates the 30-day change in LTH realized cap as a gauge for USD denominated capital inflow/outflow into this cohort.
Converts to a Z-Score to enable comparison to past cycles where USD valuations were much smaller.
High Values
indicates that large volumes of USD value are maturing into LTHs status, lifting their aggregate cost basis.
Low Values
indicate that the LTH cost basis is declining significantly, driven by points 1) and/or 2) above.
What we see is that LTHs are currently experiencing the largest decline in their aggregate cost basis in history, with the Z-Score is trading 2.33 standard deviations below the mean. When coupled with the URPD metric and the Profit/Loss bands to exchanges metric, this describes a very healthy redistribution of coin supply from higher prices, into a new floor range between $38k and $45k.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin bear markets can be long, painful, and drawn out, however they have the ultimate result of reshuffling supply ownership away from weaker, and towards stronger hands. Bitcoin has seen fairly heavy accumulation occur between $35k and $42k, suggesting many investors see a value zone in the current consolidation range.
There is modest spending taking place over the past few weeks, with much of it being coins held at a loss. As a result, the aggregate cost bases of both Long- and Short-Term holders are in decline, the former to a historically significant degree. So far the Bitcoin bulls have provided adequate support

MacroStrategy
, and the
Luna Foundation Guard
, announcing, or completing significant Bitcoin purchases. With Bitcoin having a deterministic supply schedule and ultimate supply hard-cap, these events represent yet another step towards Bitcoin being perceived by the market as a form of pristine collateral.
The market traded relatively range-bound this week, between a low of $44,427, and a high of $48,083, consolidating after the recent price rally.
The perception and utilisation of Bitcoin as a form of financial collateral has been a steadily growing trend, and continues to span into new applications and use-cases. The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was a dominant buyer throughout last week, with the ultimate intention to use accumulated BTC as a backstop for the UST algorithmic stablecoin. In addition, inflows into wrapped WBTC, Canadian ETFs, and general investor accumulation on-chain has been historically strong, especially following the local price lows set on 22-January.
In this edition, we will explore a range of major supply sinks for Bitcoin, and characterise the accumulation behaviour over the recent weeks. Accumulation is being driven by both Shrimps (< 1BTC) and Whales (> 1k BTC), alongside these specific public entities (
read more on our research describing Shrimps, and Whale holding denominations
).
Executive Summary
Exchanges continue to see significant net coin outflows, with aggregate exchange balances hitting multi-year lows. BTC is flowing out of exchanges at a rate of over 96k BTC/month, signalling historically strong accumulation is taking place.
Accumulation is being driven by Shrimps (<1 BTC) and Whales (>1k BTC), both of whom have added significantly to their balances over recent weeks.
Large scale accumulation by the Luna Foundation Guard has taken place, with an increase of total holdings by 21,163 BTC over the last 9-days. Additionally, the total supply of wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum (WBTC) has grown by 12.5k BTC showing a continuous demand for BTC as collateral in DeFi products.
Coins have continued to flow into Canadian Bitcoin ETF products, with total holdings increasing by 6,594 BTC since 22-Jan This is a 10.5% growth in coin holdings, despite the plethora of macro and geopolitical risks and headwinds that are in play.

Bitcoin Milestone: 19 Millionth BTC Mined
This week the total Bitcoin supply reached the 19-millionth coin mined, leaving less than 9.52% of the final 21M supply left to be mined over the next ~118 years. At the time of writing (block height 730,278), the total BTC supply was 19,001,529.68 BTC, with a daily issuance of 918 BTC/day (14-day median basis).
Live Chart
A Week of Historically Strong Accumulation
As noted in the introduction, it has been a particularly impressive week for BTC accumulation trends, with both discrete public buyers, and the wider market adding to their balances.
The Accumulation Trend Score is one of our latest tools released to track the relative on-chain balance change of the market at large. Values closer to 1 (purple) indicate that whales and/or a large proportion of market entities are adding significantly to their balances. This week returned a consistent stream of values upwards of 0.65, which indicates a general trend of accumulation is underway.
Live Chart
We can see that exchange balances have also experienced a historically significant period of BTC outflows in response, reaching an outflow rate of 96.2k BTC/month. Outflows of this magnitude are uncommon, having happened on only several occasions through history.
A very noticeable transition from net inflows (green), into a regime of dominant outflows (red) remains in play, a trend that started immediately following the March 2020 market crash.
Live Chart
The impact of such a sustained, and high magnitude of BTC outflows is that the total balance held on exchanges has proceeded to multi-year lows. Over the course of March, over 96k BTC flowed out of the exchanges we track, reaching levels last seen in August 2018. Note that this represents a notable break downwards from the generally sideways plateau in exchange balances that was established from September 2021.
Live Chart
Diving deeper into specific exchanges, we can see that the majority of outflows are coming out of the largest exchanges in the industry. Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Kraken, Bittrex and Bitstamp have seen significant net outflows of late, despite many of these seeing
net balance increases over the last 12-24months
. Binance in particular, which saw its coin balance dominance explode higher in 2021, has seen over 20.8k BTC in outflows over the last 2-weeks.
Live Chart
So Who is Accumulating?
Having established that a general trend of accumulation is taking place, we can now characterise the types of buyers participating. We can see that the Accumulation Balance continues to climb. This supply represents coins that are held in addresses with more than one deposit, and no history of spending. This metric excludes exchanges and miners, but will include large entities like custodians, LFG, and MacroStrategy.
The total balance held in Accumulation Addresses has risen by 217k BTC over the last four months, measured since the market deleveraging event on 4-December. This represents a growth rate of 1,800 BTC/day which is 2x the daily issuance to miners. Note that this also breaks away from a generally sideways balance trend established through most of 2021.
Live Chart
Next we look at on-chain entities with balances less than 1BTC, often referred to as
Bitcoin Shrimp
. These buyers are most likely to be retail level, or individuals, and this cohort has been aggressively accumulating since the local price lows set on 22-Jan. Over the course of the last ~2 months, Bitcoin shrimp have accumulated 0.579% of the circulating supply, which is 1.7x more coins than were mined over the same time.
Bitcoin Shrimp currently hold 14.256% of the coin supply in aggregate (note that this does not include any supply held by exchanges, which represent an additional thousands to millions of retail level customers in aggregate).
Live Chart
Next we look to the average supply held in each address associated with larger Bitcoin holders with 100 to 10k BTC in holdings (
sharks to whales
). Since August 2021, the average volume of BTC held in each address by this cohort has plateaued between 570 and 585 BTC per address. This is the result of both supply held, and address counts in this cohort remaining fairly stable over this time. This generally suggests that this wallet cohort are contributing the least to the current accumulation trends.
Live Chart
Finally, we can confirm and refine the above observations by looking to an unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room, which breaks down the Accumulation Trend Score into wallet cohorts. Here we can see that smaller buyers (up to 100 BTC) have been the heavy accumulators since late-Jan, with the smaller balances (<1 BTC) being the most aggressive (green zone).
We can also see the 100-1k BTC wallet cohorts have contributed the least to the overall accumulation (red zone), whilst Whale cohorts (>1k BTC) have commenced serious accumulation over the last two weeks. This includes entities such as LFG, which we will explore more in the next section.
Unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room
Major Bitcoin Supply Sinks
We have established that a very large volume of BTC is being accumulated by Whale entities (> 1k BTC) over the last two weeks. One of the most public entities has been the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), which has now amassed a trove of 30,727 BTC. With an initial purchase of 9,564 BTC in late-Jan, valued at $358.6M at the time, the LFG balance has now grown by 21,163 BTC over a nine-day period. The total value of the LFG balance is now over $1.40 Billion.
Live Chart
The trend of wrapping Bitcoin into a tokenised variant, for deployment on other blockchains has also been a steady over recent years. Over 1.449% of the Bitcoin supply (275,236 BTC) is now held by the custodian BitGo, and issued as a tokenized version WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain.
Since the market lows on 22-Jan, the WBTC supply has grown by an additional 12.5k BTC, demonstrating an increased demand for Bitcoin collateral in DeFi, despite the chaotic macro and geopolitical conditions.
Live Chart
There has also been notable inflows into various Canadian ETFs, with Purpose ETF receiving the lions share of inflows. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF currently holds 35k BTC, seeing net inflows of 5,521 BTC since the 22-Jan price lows. This is a net growth of 18.7% of total BTC holdings in this time, amidst a storm of macro and geopolitical headwinds. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF now has $1.627B in assets under management.
Live Chart
In aggregate, the total holdings of all Canadian ETF products has risen by 6,594 BTC since late January, reaching an all-time-high of just over 69k BTC (0.36% of circulating supply).
It is quite impressive to observe such strong outflows from exchanges (spot holdings), as well as inflows into both ETF products, DeFi applications, and on-chain accumulation wallets, despite the numerous macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds of recent months.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market has seen a number of weeks of historically strong accumulation, which has been fairly widespread in relation to participation across wallet cohorts. Shrimp and Whales are the most aggressive accumulators of late, with a number of large public buyers such as LFG and MacroStrategy adding renewed emphasis on Bitcoin as pristine collateral.
What is most impressive is the general increase in Bitcoin demand across ETF products available in Canada, despite the plethora of headwinds such as conflict in Ukraine, commodity price rises and shortages, and tightening monetary condition.
In general, the market appears to be viewing Bitcoin and its role in the future economy with a somewhat renewed optimism. This is most clearly reflected in the net trend of outflows from exchanges, and into self or assisted-custody, a trend which started immediately following the March 2020 liquidity crisis.
With the 19 millionth coin now mined, and general accumulation exceeding daily issuance by many multiples, the scarcity and pristine nature of Bitcoin as collateral may well be returning to the foreground once again.

This market weakness follows a relatively modest price break-out from the multi-month consolidation range that has been established since mid-January. On-chain activity and spending behaviours suggest that investors have been taking profits during the recent rally, and that we are yet to see a convincing influx of new users or demand.
In this edition we will explore the nature of the market recovery across on-chain activity and network profitability as a measure for growth and health of the Bitcoin user-base. We will also explore some of the mechanisms that enable the interesting dichotomy of BTC denominated transaction fees and block subsidy being near all-time-lows, whilst competition in the mining industry sets new all-time-highs.
Executive Summary
The Bitcoin market pulled back this week as it struggles to establish upside price momentum.
On-chain activity remains fairly muted, suggesting that there is little growth in the user-base, minimal inflows of new demand, and that the market remains largely HODLer dominated.
Investor spending behaviour appears to be switching from dominance of loss realization, towards a modest amount of profit taking. 58% of transaction volume is currently realizing a profit.
Aggregate Bitcoin transaction fees are currently near all-time-lows, a result of a confluence of factors including SegWit adoption, transaction batching, and the aforementioned lack of demand for Bitcoin block-space.
Despite this, USD denominated miner revenue is up 150% compared to after the last halving event, and both hash-rate and protocol difficulty are setting consistent all-time-highs.

On-chain Activity Continues to Languish
A powerful set of tools for tracking the cyclical nature of Bitcoin cycles is on-chain activity, broadly described as the utilisation of block-space via active network participants sending transactions and settling value. Metrics which describe this include active addresses/entities, transaction counts, mempool congestion, and fees paid.
Across this suite of metrics, it is hard to find many observations that suggest the network user-base is recovering or growing strongly. The number of active entities (analogous to daily active users) remains within the bear market channel that has been established over the last six years. That said, the current active entity count of 296k/day is at the upper end of this channel, and a sustained expansion higher would be constructive.
Live Chart
Transaction counts are also relatively lacklustre, currently at around 225k transactions per day, which is similar in magnitude to during the 2019 bear market. As with active entities, this metric has recovered from the lows of the collapse back in May-July 2021, but is a far cry from the hype cycle observed during bull markets (shown in green).
What is quite interesting to see is that over the longer term macro time-scale, both of these on-chain activity metrics continue to climb, even during bear market trends. This signals a persistent growth in the HODLer user-base. HODLers are those investors whom are relatively price insensitive, and are active Bitcoin users and accumulators irrespective of market conditions.
Live Chart
A result of this relatively low demand for Bitcoin block-space is that there is little network congestion, and thus a low aggregate in transaction fees paid. Total transaction fees paid to Bitcoin miners has been languishing near all-time-lows since May, supporting the above observations that the recovery in on-chain activity is lacklustre at best.
Live Chart
It should be noted that there are numerous factors that impact network congestion and total fees paid, which includes the adoption of efficiency upgrades like SegWit, and transaction batching. The chart below shows that since June 2021, there has been a significant uptick in SegWit adoption and utilization, as more wallets and exchanges implement the technology (
read more of our research on SegWit Utilization, and the adoption by Exchanges
).
Live Chart
The next chart also shows the expansion of spent outputs that are using SegWit technology, with the uptick after June 2021 standing out. Transactions using SegWit are more data efficient, which allows for more transactions to fit in each block (lowering congestion), whilst also having cheaper transaction fees.
In the current market, this is part of a confluence of factors that are driving fees lower as was well articulated by
Alex Thorn (Galaxy Digital) in this thread
. It is important to note however that a low demand for Bitcoin block-space, and low on-chain activity as a result of bearish market conditions is one of the major driving factors behind low aggregate transaction fees.
Live Chart
Mining Competition Reaches All-Time-High
Despite network transaction fees being near all time lows in (BTC denominated terms), the competition in the mining industry continues to set new all-time-highs. The protocol mining difficulty has now reached a new ATH, with each Bitcoin block requiring 122.78 Zettahashes to solve.
This would be equivalent to all 7.938 Billion people on earth each guessing a SHA256 hash 15.5 Trillion times, every 10mins to solve each Bitcoin block. Quite extraordinary.

The estimated hash-rate is currently ranging between 190 and 215 Exahash per second, which is around 20% higher than the prior ATH set just before the mining ban was enacted in China in May last year. Hash-rate has continued to expand higher since June last year, with growth largely uninterrupted by the recent bearish market conditions, nor the numerous macro and geopolitical headwinds that are in play.
Live Chart
Competition in the mining industry is notoriously fierce, as miners seek to arbitrage the energy/BTC price ratio by finding the cheapest available sources of power and capital funding. As hash-rate competition expands, ASIC efficiency and rig counts increase, and the revenue earned per hash is driven ever lower over the long-term. The chart below shows this long-term trend which illustrates, in log-scale, just how competitive the landscape for acquiring the ever declining Bitcoin block reward is.
Live Chart
Despite both the immense competition, and the BTC denominated block reward being near all-time-lows, USD denominated miner revenue remains 150% higher than immediately following the most recent halving event in May 2020. Miners currently earn approximately $207k per Exahash they apply to the network. This is also 40% more revenue than during the final capitulation event of the 2018 bear market. As that time prices were trading between $3k and $4k and the BTC block subsidy was twice as large as it is today.
Live Chart
Network Profitability
Assessing the profitability of the Bitcoin network is a useful tool for assessing possible sell-side risks, and gauging whether the market is HODLing, or taking profits.
The chart below presents the proportion of the market that is currently underwater on their position. Here we use the percent of addresses (pink), entities (green) and supply (blue) that are in profit as a measure of aggregate network profitability. We can see that the current bear market is not as severe as the worst phases of all prior cycles, with just 25% to 30% of the market being at an unrealized loss. It remains to be seen if further sell-side pressure will drive the market lower, and thus pull more of the market into an unrealized loss like prior cycles.
Note that over time, more coins and UTXOs will have last moved at much cheaper prices and thus the long term uptrend in these metrics is expected.
Live Chart
Bitcoin Long-term holders (LTHs) currently hold 13.66% of the supply that is at an unrealized loss, which is a sum approximately equal in magnitude to the amount of sell-side they applied in the 2020-21 bull market. LTH coins are the least likely to be spent and sold on a statistical basis, and it can be seen in 2018 and March 2020 that they have held through much deeper losses in the past.
The proportion of LTH coins held at a loss reached over 35% of supply in the depths of previous bear cycles, which is 2.5x more relative coin volume than we have in the current market.
Live Chart
Short-Term holders (STHs) own far fewer coins compared to LTHs (18.74% of supply), however this cohort has a seen a marked jump in profitability of late. As the market rallied out of the consolidation range, new accumulators (STHs) that acquired coins between $33k and $42k have returned to an unrealized profit, showing that investors saw value in that price range.
This is a positive development compared to the recent market lows on 22-Jan, where 100% of all STH coins were at a loss. Improving investor profitability, especially in this more price sensitive STH cohort tends to lower the probability of panic driven sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
We have however seen an uptick in profit taking, and a decline in loss realization during this rally. Daily realized losses have declined from ~20k BTC/day at the lows in January, to around 8.3k BTC/day today. Periods of high and sustained loss realization are typical of bear markets, and the market has absorbed more than 8.3k BTC in losses realized per day since late-November.
Live Workbench Chart
In addition to the coins realizing losses, the market has seen around 13.3k BTC in profits realized each day since mid-February. Profit realization at this magnitude is not historically extreme, however appears to be providing sufficient headwinds to prices. Heavier profit realization is typical of bullish conditions where a large influx of new demand is capable of absorbing the supply and pushing the market higher.
Live Workbench Chart
And finally, we can see that the dominance of spent volume profitability has moved towards a profit bias. In other words, 58% of transaction volume is currently realizing profit, which is a change from the bias towards realized losses that was in place since December.
Sustained periods of realized loss dominance are typical of bear markets, and a reversal to a dominance of realizing profits can signal that sentiment is shifting, and demand is capable to absorb the sell-side. However, given prices continue to struggle, it does suggest that the demand side remains somewhat lacklustre, and that investors are taking profits into whatever market strength can be found.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market has pulled back this week after a break-out from the multi-month consolidation range. Prices have thus far struggled to find much sustained upside momentum, and there are indications of a modest volume of profit taking by investors. Especially across on-chain activity metrics like transaction counts and active users, the recovery has thus far been relatively lacklustre, and continues to suggest Bitcoin is a HODLer dominated market, with few new investors flowing in.
That said, network profitability has improved indicating significant re-accumulation took place since January. The aggregate profitability of the network remains in a far healthier position compared to prior bear cycles.
Low demand for Bitcoin block-space manifests as a low aggregate transaction fee paid to miners, which has the current BTC denominated block reward near all-time-lows. However despite this, competition within the Bitcoin mining industry is setting new all-time-highs, with miner USD revenue up 150% since the halving, and hash-rate now 20% higher than the previous high in May 2021.

Prices peaked at a high of $41,446 early in the week, before sliding to set a new local low of $38,729.
The Bitcoin market remains strongly correlated with traditional equity markets, which themselves have struggled to catch any serious or sustained bid, running up against numerous macro headwinds. The current broader market environment is one of rapid change, with a wide array of commodity markets breaking to new highs, bond yields trading strongly higher, and a seemingly ever worsening supply chain disruptions and headline inflation. As a relatively new, globally traded, and persistently active market, it is unsurprising that the Bitcoin price often reacts to a very wide scope of market forces.
Absorbing information across so many market segments is exceptionally challenging. However, if we consider Bitcoin to be an asset that appears to increasingly respond to broad market forces, then a study of its holding behaviour can provide a somewhat distilled view into the investment decisions and sentiment of other market participants.
In this edition we will deep dive into two important cohorts of Bitcoin holders,
which we have defined
based in their statistical likelihood of spending coins; the Long and Short-Term Holders. By analysing these two groups, we can identify holding patterns, capitulation potential, and whether risks and opportunities can be identified via the study of their aggregate behaviour.

Investor Value Zone
In the last few newsletter editions, we have explored how the $35k to $42k price zone for Bitcoin has seen fairly significant investor demand inflows, with a large number of coins changing hands in this price range. What we have yet to see is a
follow on impulse
of demand to break free of this range, and as a result, it continues to act as a source of gravity on the market.
In the first two charts, we will explore how the price distribution of coin supply has changed between the $33k low set on 22-Jan, and today.
The current price low of $33k was set on 22-Jan, putting a pause on the 2.5 month price decline from the ATH set in early November. On the 22-Jan, the range of prices at which the Bitcoin supply had last transacted was relatively well distributed between $35k and $63k (think of this as an on-chain volume profile in technical analysis).
This shows a relatively consistent demand was in place for BTC both on the way up (Aug-Nov) and on the way back down (Nov-Jan).
Live Chart
If we compare this (blue) to the current coin price distribution, we can identify the following insights:
A large amount of coin supply has been re-accumulated between $38k and $45k
, which is the primary price range of the current market consolidation.
Blue:
Much of the volume profile from 22-Jan remains intact. Despite an additional 2.5 months of sideways consolidation, a large proportion of the market appears unwilling to spend and sell their coins, even if their coins are held at a loss. This suggests price insensitive HODLers hold much of the supply > $40k.
Green:
Coins that have been redistributed at a profit since the $33k low appear to come mainly from dip buyers ($32k and $36k), as well as a sizeable volume of ~60k BTC from the $3k to $4k price range.
Red:
pockets of redistribution at a loss have occurred as buyers who purchased after the Nov ATH realised that the dip was not over, and realised losses on the way down.
The overall takeaway observation is that the pattern of both profits and losses realised over the last 2.5 months suggest that investors continue to see the $35k to $42k range as a value zone for accumulation.
Live Chart
We define the threshold between Short and Long-Term Holders as 155-days, which at the time of writing, is positioned just after the Nov ATH. In simple terms:
Almost everyone who purchased after the ATH is a Short-Term Holder.
This cohort is the most likely to spend their coins in reaction to market volatility.
Almost everyone who purchased before the ATH is a Long-Term Holder.
This cohort are the least likely to spend their coins, preferring to accumulate in anticipation of the next macro bull market.
The chart below presents the current volume profile, however broken into LTH (blue) and STH (red) cohorts. We can draw the following conclusions:
Short-Term Holders (red):
Very few remain between $50k and $60k, suggesting most 'top buyers' have likely already capitulated. Conversely, a huge amount of new STH demand is clustered between $38k and $50k, affirming that investors continue to see value in this price range (new buyers).
Long-Term Holders (blue):
LTHs currently hold 15.2% of the coin supply at a loss, with coins held even at prices above $60k. These investors have weathered significant volatility, yet continue to hold. This supports the notion that these investors are a relatively price insensitive bunch, and remain the least likely to exert sell-side pressure.
An unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room
Historic Growth in Unrealized Losses
Now that we have profiled the various price ranges that investors hold their coins, we can dive deeper into the potential risk profile of additional sell-side pressure. The chart below presents the proportion of coins held by LTH (blue) and STH (red) that are at a loss.
We can see an approximately even split of 15.2% LTH : 15.0% STH, with a total of 30.2% of the coin supply held in loss.
The current market profitability is significantly better off than it was in the 2018 or 2020 bear markets. Back then, LTHs alone held more than 35% of the coin supply at loss. Furthermore, we can see a macro increase in coins held by the less price sensitive LTHs (black arrows). This is the result of accumulation and LTHs making value acquisitions, whilst also being willing to weather any price drawdowns that follow.
We can however see that compared to the May-July 2021 period, market profitability is in a worse position, with LTHs in particular holding significantly more supply at a loss compared to this period.
Live Chart
We can construct an oscillator (Z-Score) for the rate of change for LTH coins held in loss. Here, we are attempting to see how quickly the profitability of the market is changing.
In simple terms:
This oscillator will be positive
when lots of LTH coins are returning to profit. This will be the result of prices rallying, after heavy LTH accumulation.
This oscillator will be negative
when lots of LTH coins fall into a loss. This will be the result of prices falling, and LTHs being caught by surprise by a correction.
What we can see is that the recent correction pushed a historically significant volume of LTH coins into an unrealised loss. This means that the amount of buying between August and November, which has now become underwater HODLing, is some of the most significant of all time.
Lots of LTHs were caught off-side by this correction. Previous instances of such high readings have usually been in late stage bear markets, most of which preceded a final capitulation shake-out event.
Live Workbench Chart
If we shift our focus to the Short-Term Holders, we can see a similar pattern is in effect. The massive positive value reached in October is very similar to the 2019 rally, where a large proportion of the market returned to profitability in a relatively short timespan (A).
What followed in both instances (B) was a long and painful drawdown that plunged all buyers who believed the bear market was over, back into an unrealized loss. Both the 2019, and current bear market trends are historically significant by this metric.
The takeaway from this study is that a historically large volume of investors who were active between August 2021, and January 2022 have seen the market price plunge below their cost basis, which has catalysed a large scale redistribution of the Bitcoin supply to new hands.
Live Workbench Chart
Have We Capitulated Yet?
The notion of an investor capitulation is widely understood and talked about in markets, and they usually precipitate the end of a bear market trend. Capitulation events are typically characterised as a complete and total loss of confidence, large scale sell-pressure, and high volume, that effectively exhausts any and all remaining bears from the market.
To quickly recap so far, we have established:
A great majority of investors who currently hold coins purchased above $40k are Long-Term Holders (pre-ATH), and have weathered significant volatility. This suggests they are price insensitive HODLers, and less likely to apply sell-side pressure.
The majority of Short-Term Holders who purchased after the ATH, and above $50k have already capitulated and redistributed their coins. This sell-side is largely exhausted.
Investors continue to see value between $35k and $42k, with accumulation trends remaining very constructive in this region, albeit lacking the momentum to break higher (or lower) just yet.
The rate at which both LTH and STH coins fell into an unrealized loss during this correction has been historically significant, suggesting the confidence and conviction of Bitcoin investors has been thoroughly tested.
The question now becomes, with such significant financial pain already weathered by the market, what will it take to precipitate a final capitulation flush out?
If we look at the rate of decline of the Short-Term Holder realized cap (cost basis, Z-Score), we can see that it has fallen by yet another historical margin. The magnitude of STH realized losses has only been at a similar magnitude twice in the past, both occurring in the worst phases of the 2018 bear market.
By this metric, a STH capitulation has already occurred, and it is twice as severe as during the July 2021 bottom at $29k.
Live Workbench Chart
And finally, when we perform the same study for Long-Term Holders, we see something even more impressive. The degree to which the Long-Term Holder realized price (currently trading at $14.6k) has declined is the deepest in history, and is without an equal.
There are only three mechanisms by which the LTH realized cap can decline:
Large volumes of coins are crossing the 155-day age threshold, and have a much lower acquisition price than the aggregate. This is common after periods of heavy accumulation.
Given the 155-day threshold is at the November ATH, this mechanism cannot be the primary contributor as coins maturing of late will have much a higher cost basis than $14.6k.
Existing LTHs are adding to their balance
at prices that are lower than their personal average cost basis. This is a plausible mechanism for class of 2021 LTHs whom have a cost basis > $40k. However, this mechanism is a weak contributor given the aggregate LTH Realized price is much lower at $14.6k.
LTH held coins that were held at a cost basis much higher than the aggregate ($14.6k) are capitulating.
They are leaving the LTH cohort, and redistributing their coins to new STH buyers. This effectively removes high cost basis coins from the aggregate, giving coins with much cheaper cost bases (such as coins from previous cycles) more weight.
Point 3 is by far the most probable mechanism, signalling that many LTHs who were caught by surprise by the current correction, have now capitulated out of the market...right into the hands of buyers who see value between $35k and $42k.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market is global, and trades 24/7, making it highly responsive to macroeconomic conditions, shocks, and correlation to traditional assets like equities and bonds. With the current environment having its fair share of headwinds, analysis of Bitcoin market participants on-chain can provide insight into the sentiment and decisions of a cohort of contrarian investors.
What we have seen over the last 5-months is a 50%+ correction that appears to have significantly reshuffled the ownership structure of BTC. A great many Long-Term Holders with coins above $50k appear completely unfazed, whilst others have been totally shaken-out, at a historically significant rate.
Many investors are awaiting a complete and total capitulation of of the market, which may well be around the corner given the volume of coins held at a loss, and weak price structure. However under the surface, it appears as though a huge swathe of the market has already capitulated, in a statistically significant manner, and a resilient inflow of demand between $35k to $42k range has quietly absorbed this sell-side in its entirety.

Market prices weakened slightly again this week, trading off a high of $42,893, and losing ground at a weekly low of $38,729.
The market has now traded within an increasingly tight price range for almost three months, leading to historically low yields available in futures markets cash-and-carry trades, alongside a persistent decline in trade volumes. Implied volatility priced into options markets has also broken below 60% this week, which is significantly lower than the 80%+ volatility that characterised much of 2021. Furthermore, transaction volumes on-chain remain muted, albeit with a growing trend of high value ($10M+) transactions, and a macro decline in volumes associated with exchange inflows and outflows.
In this edition, we will focus on a number of these big picture trends that are developing in Bitcoin markets, including:
Compressing trade volumes, low implied options volatility, and rolling basis yields persistently below 3% in futures markets. All are leading to a leaking of capital out of Bitcoin markets as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.
The dominance of perpetual futures markets continues to grow, as these instruments have clearly become the preferred source of leverage.
Declining on-chain settlement volume, however with a growing dominance of large size transactions ($10M+).
Cyclical divergence between exchange related inflow/outflow volume, and total transaction volume. This accompanies a potential shift in momentum with respect to network utilisation, and provides a potentially constructive reversal in the fundamentally implied valuation for Bitcoin.

Perpetual Futures Dominance On The Rise
Over the last five years or so, the market for Bitcoin derivatives has grown and matured in leaps and bounds. It has transitioned from a small fraction of spot trade volume in 2017, to now represent the dominant venue for price discovery. Futures trade volume now represents multiples of spot market volume.
Nevertheless, the aggregate futures trade volume has been in a macro decline since Jan 2021. During the first half of 2021, trade volumes between $70B and $80B per day were typical. In the current market however, futures trade volumes are down over 59%, currently around $30.7B/day. There was barely an uptick in Oct-Nov 2021, even as prices pushed to new all-time-highs.
Live Chart
Open interest in futures markets is also notably lower than it was during peak bullish periods, currently hovering around $15 Billion, with a 2:1 split between perpetual futures, and calendar expiring futures. Current open interest is similar to levels seen in the May-Sept 2021 period, but remains 36.8% below the $22.5B+ peaks set in April, and again in November.
Live Chart
Perpetual futures are increasingly becoming the preferred instrument for trading, a trend that can be clearly visualised in the dominance chart below:
Blue
represents the dominance of perpetual swap trade volume compared to the total futures volume, showing a remarkable 92.4% dominance at present. This has increased from 75% dominance in Dec 2020 as the market broke through last cycles $20k ATH.
Pink
represents the same dominance concept, but applied to futures open interest, which has risen from 50%, to over 66% dominance since Dec 2020.
In many ways, this trend is expected, and is likely a result of a few key factors:
Perpetual swaps more closely match spot index pricing, thus making it easier and more intuitive for traders to manage positions and leverage.
Low storage and delivery costs associated with digital assets negates many of the benefits of calendar futures when compared to physical commodities. Calendar futures provide useful tools for hedging risk, and pricing future production and delivery costs for physical commodities, however these costs approach zero for Bitcoin.
Live Workbench Chart
This trend also be seen in the Futures Leverage Ratio, which remains in a structural uptrend. This reflects a growing trend of the market deploying capital preferentially into perpetual swap markets, rather than calendar futures. The current open interest in perpetual swaps is equivalent to 1.3% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is approaching historically high levels.
However it should be noted that the aggregate leverage ratio for all futures markets has actually declined over the last two weeks, falling from 2.1% in early April, to 1.9% today. As such, whilst perpetual swap open interest is relatively high, there is an even larger aggregate transfer of capital and leverage out of calendar expiring futures, creating a net decline in overall leverage.
Live Workbench Chart
Yield and Volatility Compression Continues
A declining leverage ratio across all futures markets, despite increasing leverage in perpetual swaps, suggests that a reasonable volume of capital is actually leaving the Bitcoin market. This is further supported by the declining trade volumes shown above.
If we look at perpetual swap funding rates, we can see that the majority of 2022 has seen very low available yields, and little directional bias. This is a stark contrast to the hyper-bullish long speculation in H1-2021 and again from Aug-Nov, and periods of extreme bearishness in May-July 2021.
Live Chart
If we annualize the perpetual funding rate, and compare it to the 3-month rolling basis available in calendar futures, we can see a likely reason behind why capital is rotating out of Bitcoin markets.
Yields available in futures markets have compressed to levels barely above 3.0%, which is hardly superior to the yield available from a 10y US treasury bond (2.9%), and significantly lower than the recent US CPI inflation print of 8.5%. It is likely that declining trade volumes and lower aggregate open interest is a symptom of capital flowing out of Bitcoin derivatives, and towards higher yield, and potentially lower perceived risk opportunities.
Live Workbench Chart
We can also see that options markets are pricing in historically low implied volatility, breaking below 60% over the past few weeks. There are very few instances in the last year where implied volatility has been this low, most of which are during the current consolidation range which has contained almost all of the year-to-date price action.
With low implied volatility in options markets, options short sellers are in a similar, low yield boat, as cash-and-carry futures traders.
Live Chart
We can also see a general shift in sentiment and risk management in the Put-to-Call ratios associated with both options trade volume (blue) and open interest (pink). Demand for call options dominated much of 2021, through til September, where bullish sentiment appears to wind down. As 2022 commenced, a distinct market preference emerged for put options, as more bearish sentiment took hold, and the demand for hedging downside risk increased.
Live Workbench Chart
Divergence in On-chain Volumes
Transitioning away from derivatives markets, we can see a similar trend of declining aggregate volume exists within on-chain settlement volumes. The Bitcoin network is currently settling between $5.5B and $7.0B in value per day, which is around 40% lower than the $9.5B to $11.0B/day seen at the bull market peaks.
Settlement volumes do however remain notably higher than the ~$2.0B/day seen throughout 2019-20, suggesting a net increase in network utilisation has occurred.
Live Chart
The breakdown of transaction size also appears to have structurally changed, most notably after October 2020. The chart below shows the relative breakdown of transaction volume by USD value, and the explosion of dominance for $10M+ transaction size (dark green) is quite clear. Prior to October 2020, these large size transactions barely accounted for 10% of transfer volume on a big day, however now reflect a fairly consistent 40% dominance.
Note that these charts utilise our entity-adjusted data, which filters out non-economic transactions such as exchange internal wallet management, and entity self-spends. It is likely that this sustained dominance of large transactions reflects a very real growth in value settlement by institutional sized investment/trading entities, custodians, and high net worth individuals.
Live Chart
Transfer volumes in and out of exchanges have always represented a significant share of overall transaction flows and are important to assess in context. The chart below shows the total entity-adjusted volume (blue), in comparison with exchange inflows (green) and outflows (red), all with a USD denomination.
Firstly, we can see that inflows and outflows are often quite similar in scale, with traces generally overlying each other, at least visually at this scale. Total exchange flows currently represent around $2.1B per day, with a slight dominance towards outflows ($1.1B/day vs inflows of $1.0B/day).
Live Workbench Chart
We can then take a ratio between total exchange flows (inflows + outflows), and total transfer volume, in an attempt to observe cyclical patterns associated with exchange transaction dominance.
Particularly since 2016, on-chain volume associated with exchange inflows/outflows generally increases during more speculative and bullish periods, such as the 2016-17 bull run, and again from July-2019 to May-2021.
Conversely, during later stage bear markets, such as 2018-19, and since May 2021, the share of exchange related activity generally declines relative to aggregate value settlement.
Volume in and out of exchanges currently represents between around 32% of all value settled, which is relatively low. This perhaps suggests there is a gradual transition away from pure speculation, and towards more fundamentally driven demand flows such as OTC transactions, HODLer accumulation, and custodial multi-signature setups etc.
Live Workbench Chart
Finally, we can take these observations of aggregate transaction volumes, and model them as a fundamental pricing model, via a methodology first proposed by Willy Woo. The NVT price model takes the 2-year median of the NVT Ratio, and multiplies it by current transaction volume. The resulting model thus establishes an implied valuation based on the current utilisation levels of Bitcoin for value settlement.
A 28-day (green) and 90-day (pink) period are used to establish a fast and slow signal respectively. These two models currently value Bitcoin between $32.5k (90-day) and $36.1k, with both starting to bottom out and potentially reverse. Of note is the recent positive momentum cross-over, with the faster 28-day breaking above the 90-day.
Historically, such cross-overs have been constructive medium to long term signals. However, as shown in blue below, these signals do require the confirmation of time to properly prove that positive momentum is in play. Greater value settlement on-chain would trigger both of these models to increase, implying stronger underlying fundamentals (and vice-versa is also true).
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin derivatives markets have matured significantly over recent years, and the underlying structure of them continues to evolve. We have seen a distinct shift in the preferred instrument away from calendar expiring futures, and towards perpetual swap markets, which is expected given the ease of price interpretation, and low storage and delivery costs of digital assets.
Over the course of the last 12-months, we have seen trade volumes, implied volatility, and available cash-and-carry yields compress to historical lows, which appears to be motivating some capital to leave the Bitcoin space in search of higher returns. With cash-and-carry yields persistently below 3.0%, and headline inflation running at 8.5%, this becomes increasingly probable.
Interestingly, despite on-chain settlement volumes being similarly muted, there is a growing (but early) trend of strength developing in underlying fundamentals. Transactions larger than $10M have sustained ~40% dominance since late 2020, and the dominance of speculative exchange inflows and outflows, often associated with bull markets, appears to be in decline.
Implied valuations of the NVT price model remain in the low to mid $30k region, which does indicate the bulls have their work cut out for them. However, these models are perhaps starting to bottom out and reverse, which is a trend worth keeping an eye on over the coming weeks.

This week saw significant weakness across equities, bonds, and cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin trading down to a new monthly low of $37,614.
Despite trading down this week, Bitcoin markets have actually remained surprisingly robust, on a relative basis. Whilst the S&P500 and NASDAQ indexes traded to new local lows of the prevailing bearish trend, Bitcoin prices remain range-bound, and continue to lack any definitive macro momentum in either direction. With that said, correlations between Bitcoin and traditional markets remain near all-time-highs, and a broader perception of Bitcoin as a risk asset remains a significant headwind.
A very large proportion of Bitcoin investors are peering into the abyss of holding unprofitable positions, creating the potential tinder for a much discussed capitulation event. Simultaneously however, numerous long term macro indicators are signalling historical undervaluation levels are in play, reaching values rarely seen outside late stage bear market floors. In this edition, we will explore this notable divergence between the drivers of bearish short-term price action, and the medium-to-long term fundamental trends for Bitcoin.

Looking Over The Edge of Profitability
Over recent weeks, we have explored how a significant proportion of the BTC supply has been redistributed and sold to new owners entering in the $33k and $42k price range. However, with global markets continuing to slip lower, the risk that these new investors will also fall into an unrealized loss is growing.
At present, the proportion of both Addresses, Entities, and Supply held in profit is hovering around 70% (meaning 30% are held at a loss). Previous bear market lows set in 2018-19, and March 2020 saw far more severe declines in market profitability, with between 45% and 57% of the market in profit.
From this, we can establish a case study to analyse further; what would happen should an additional 10% of the market fell into an unrealised loss (the result being 60% of the market is in profit)? This provides us with an example gauge on the price that the market would need to hit before a similar 'pain threshold' is reached to past cycle lows. This '60% in profit threshold' also accounts for the observable uptrend in these floor values over time (an artefact of lost coins, HODLers from past cycles etc).
Live Workbench Chart
The URPD metric provides us a view on which prices the current Bitcoin supply was last moved at.
With prices trading at $38.5k at the time of writing, the market would need to fall to $33.6k in order to plunge an additional 1.9M BTC into an unrealized loss (10% of supply). This would reach our example 'pain threshold' of 60% supply in profit and put almost all buyers from the last 16-month cycle into the red (with buyers of the May-July 2021 lows being the only exceptions).
Live Chart
The cohort that is most at risk of selling in a panic are the Short-Term Holders (STHs), a cohort that
we identified (in Week 16
) have accumulated an extraordinary volume of coins over the last three months. If we look to the STH-MVRV Ratio (Z-Score), we can observe the magnitude of their current unrealized profitability.
In the chart below, we can see the following:
The on-chain cost basis of STHs is at $46,910
, putting the average coin held by a STH at an unrealized loss of -17.9%.
The STH-MVRV oscillator is currently at -0.75 standard deviations from the mean, which shows that the this is
a statistically significant magnitude of financial pain for the STH cohort
.
More severe profitability for STHs is not uncommon
, but is typical only during the worst sell-offs in bear markets (where oscillator is below the below blue line).
Live Workbench Chart
On the other side of the equation are the Long-Term Holders (LTHs), whom we also established
were capitulating at the greatest extent in history
. This trend appears to continue with an incredible deviation developing between two metrics taking place,
identified first by TXMC
:
Long-Term Holder Reazlied Price (blue):
This metric shows the average purchase price of all coins in the LTH cohort, and it is currently declining at the most significant rate in Bitcoin history. This indicates that LTHs from the 2021-22 cycle are capitulating, spending, and redistributing their coins, specifically during the last 3 months.
Long-Term Holder Spent Price (pink):
This metric shows the average purchase price of coins being spent by LTHs that day. It is breaking notably higher this week, meeting with the spot price, and signalling that LTHs are panic selling at break-even on average.
Both of these metrics add significant substance to the argument that the newest entrants to the LTH cohort from 2021-22 are capitulating, and fearful of further downside.
Live Workbench Chart
Characterizing Long-Term Holder Spending
We can further characterize these LTH spenders, and narrow in the typical age range of their coins using a variety of on-chain tools. First we will review a new metric that is under construction in the Glassnode engine room that presents two traces:
Oscillator (grey, 30DMA)
showing the proportion of BTC volume sent to exchanges by Long-Term Holders that is in profit. We can see it has declined significantly since September 2021, and is now hovering around 60% (adding weight to our previous pain threshold estimate).
Price chart coloured by raw profitability relative to the last year,
with red signalling high relative losses, and green/blue signalling heavy relative profits. The bear markets of 2014-15, 2018-19, and 2021-22 become quite apparent, with heavy LTH losses realized for many months.
The only LTHs whom could realize losses and trigger this result are those from the 2021-22 cycle with a higher cost basis, suggesting they dominate LTH spending behaviour into exchange at present.
Unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room
Next we look at Revived Supply 1yr+ which captures all BTC on-chain volume that was purchased prior to the
mid-May 2021 sell-off
. What we can see is that this metric is actually declining and is near relative lows. Usually very low readings of revived supply occur in deep bear markets where accumulation is the preferred behaviour of LTHs.
Live Chart
Binary Coin-days Destroyed largely corroborates this observation, with a near identical trend and notable markers. On a 7-day average basis (at hourly resolution), this metric is indicating than 18.5 hours out of each week are seeing greater than average lifespan destruction. In other words, 89% of the time, owners of older coins are choosing to keep them dormant, and are not contributing to spending sell-side pressure.
Both of these metrics further supports the notion that LTH sell-side pressure at the moment is primarily driven by owners of coins between 155-days, and ~12-months (aka 2021-22 buyers).
Live Chart
Fundamentals of a Bear Market Floor
On-chain tools can provide us with both an assessment of current investor behaviour (above), but also with fundamental valuation tools to help us map out and navigate various market cycles.
The chart below is a variant of Realized Profit (green) and Loss (pink), calculated by dividing each by the Realized Cap. This effectively normalises the USD value investors bring in/out of the market, to the relative market size, enabling us to compare cycles. From this we can broadly identify three market phases:
Bull Markets (green zone)
, where sufficient inflow of demand exists to allow investors to realize significant profits, right into the market cycle top (net capital inflows).
Bear Markets (red zone)
, where the converse is true, and declining prices result in a dominance of losses being realised by investors (net capital outflows). In 2019 and arguably late 2021, we saw profits taken into a brief bullish relief rally, that was ultimately sold into.
Disbelief Recovery to Early Bull (orange zone)
, where the market trades sideways to upwards, typical of a re-accumulation period or disbelief phase, and realized profits start to exceed losses on a consistent basis.
In the current market, we remain within the Bear Market phase, where the market is yet to provide sufficient demand and price appreciation to enable sustainable profit taking and capital inflow. Should realized profits begin to outpace losses on a sustained basis, alongside stable prices, it may suggest a transition to Phase 3 is underway.
Live Chart
One of the most well known Bitcoin indicators, and a crowd favourite, is the Mayer Multiple. This oscillator is calculated as a simple ratio between price and the 200DMA. Despite its simplicity, it has provided a robust and reliable long-term bottom and top formation indicator for Bitcoin cycles.
Here, we have mapped out a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 (green trace) as a historical 'undervaluation' level. The basis for this is that less than ~15% of Bitcoins trading life has been at, or below this level, providing a more probabilistic view. With the 200DMA trading at $47,275, this 20% discount level is currently trading at $37,820.
Bear market floors of past cycles are typically hammered out in two phases relative to the 0.8xMM level, first in the early stage of the bear (#1), and then again following a major capitulation event (#2). The market is currently hovering just above this key level in what could be argued to be a part of the 2021-22 cycle Phase #2.
Live Chart
The Reserve Risk metric provides another macro view on bear market bottoms, and is an oscillator that is heavily weighed down by when accumulation and HODLing is preferred (
see our video guide
). Historically, Reserve Risk has dipped below the 0.0025 threshold (green) in late stage bear markets (pre-bottom formation), and resurfaced part way through the subsequent bull market.
This indicator suggests that we have passed the initial late-bear-market entry point and could be well into the second half. However, based on prior cycles, it also suggests that the road ahead may still have some time, and/or downside to go.
Live Chart
In support of the notion that longer-term HODLers remain unfazed, the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple is oscillating around relative lows. This indicates that the value and magnitude of coin-days destroyed right now is small relative to the last year. This provides confluence to the Binary CDD, 1yr+ Revived supply, and Reserve Risk metrics that the dominant behaviour by long-term investors (1yr+ holding) is HODLing.
By this metric, the bear market commenced around May 2021, and is approaching a similar duration to those seen in previous cycles.
Live Chart
Finally, we will assess the RVT Ratio, which divides the Realized Cap by the network transaction volume (both in USD, and with a 28DMA applied). This oscillator is a slow, but higher conviction variant of the NVT Ratio, and has the following properties:
Uptrends and High values are historically bearish
, signalling that transaction volumes (and thus network utilisation) are declining relative to on-chain valuation (over-valued). Bear market bottoms are typically set at RVT values > 30, and confirmed by a reversal into a downtrend.
Downtrends and Low values are historically bullish
, conversely signalling that network utilisation is increasing relative to on-chain valuation (under-valued).
Sideways sustained trends
signal a relative equilibrium, and typically suggest the prevailing market trend is sustainable.
This oscillator has now set a lower high relative to that in July 2021, and is reversing into a downtrend. Should this trend be maintained, it indicates that there is a potential influx of on-chain settlement volume, and growing network utilisation. This has historically been constructive for market prices.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The current market structure for Bitcoin remains in an extremely delicate equilibrium, with short-term price action and network profitability leaning bearish, whilst long-term trends remain constructive. The capitulation of Long-Term Holders appears to be continuing, with further evidence and analytical colour added to this concept this week.
Whether macro forces and correlations with traditional markets drag Bitcoin lower remains to be seen, however numerous fundamental indicators at at or approaching noteworthy points of undervaluation. There is a constructive confluence across numerous macro indicators, ranging from technical analysis (Mayer Multiple), to coin lifespan analysis (Reserve Risk, VDD Multiple), and even fundamental network health and utilisation (RVT Ratio).
A capitulation event, alongside developing divergences in short- and long-term trends continues to make Bitcoin one of the most fascinating assets to monitor within this macroeconomic environment.

Markets initially responded well to the news on Wednesday, with Bitcoin rallying to the weekly high of $39,881. However, the positive momentum was short-lived, with markets selling off heavily on Thursday, and Bitcoin trading down -13.8% to close the week at $33,890.
In this edition, we will first assess the state of network profitability, and how it has changed relative to the 'bear market pain threshold' case study we proposed last week. Then we will take a holistic view and observe the market reaction to the recent price weakness across a number of market sectors:
On-chain transaction space and urgency in the mempool.
Exchange inflow and outflows as a gauge for capital flows.
Futures markets and liquidations to assess deleveraging risk.
Fund flows into exchange traded ETFs in Canada.
The first major stablecoin supply contraction in recent years.

Bitcoin Bulls Under Pressure
As Bitcoin prices trade lower, the bulls remain under serious pressure to establish a floor of support, as network profitability continues to decline. The Bitcoin market is now -49.5% below the November all-time-high.
Whilst this represents a significant drawdown, it remains modest when compared to the ultimate lows of prior Bitcoin bear markets. July 2021 reached a drawdown of -54.2%, and the bear markets of 2015, 2018 and March 2020 capitulated at lows between -77.2% and -85.5% off the ATH.
Live Chart
In last weeks edition
, we established a potential case study for a further decline of 10% in overall network profitability (defined as a drop in the percent of addresses, entities and/or supply in profit). In that case study, we estimated that prices would need to fall to around $33.6k to reach a similar 'pain threshold' to previous bear markets, and drop overall profitability to around 60% of the network.
As prices hit $33.8k week, we have now seen this scenario largely play out, and an additional 10% of the Bitcoin network did indeed fall into an unrealized loss. All three metrics declined from ~72% to between 60% and 62% in profit. These levels are coincident with profitability seen in the late-2018, and late 2019-20 bear markets. However it should be noted that both instances were prior to the final capitulation flush out event.
As such, further downside remains a risk, and would be within the realm of historical cycle performance.
Live Workbench Chart
Given these three metrics tend to move in tandem, we can calculate a simple change in the average network profitability over the 30-days. This provides us with an indication of the rate of change in 'financial stress' for Bitcoin investors. Over the last month, the percent of the Bitcoin network that has fallen into an unrealized loss is 15.5% on average.
This decline in profitability is the fourth most severe over the last 3-years. This is compared with July, and December 2021, which both saw profitability declines of -18.1% to -19.1%. March 2020 remains the the most significant in recent history, with -35.4% of the Bitcoin network falling into the red over just a few days.
Live Workbench Chart
The On-chain Reaction
Bitcoin markets have become increasingly dynamic over the recent years, with a holistic analysis now requiring a view of on-chain coin movements, exchange related volumes, off-chain investment vehicles (e.g. ETFs, ETPs), derivatives markets, and stablecoins. With this in mind, we will now assess the market reaction across these various venues.
The Bitcoin accumulation trend score indicator has seen a notably softer month, returning values less than 0.2 since mid-April. This generally signals more distributive behaviour, and less accumulation has been in play, and is coincident with weaker market prices.
Live Chart
We can further dissect this into wallet cohorts, where we see that across the board, most wallet cohorts from shrimp to whales, have greatly softened in their onchain accumulation trends. Very large entities with balances > 10k have been a particularly significant distributive force over the last few weeks, as can be seen by the large red values returned. Smaller investors (< 1BTC) are the strongest accumulators, however their accumulation is notably weaker than it was in February and March.
Unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room
During times of volatility and market stress, it is typical to see an influx of 'urgent' transactions enter the Bitcoin mempool, as investors seek to de-risk, sell, or re-collateralise their margin positions. As the market sold off this week, we did see an burst of 42.8k transactions enter the Bitcoin mempool. This is the highest influx in transaction activity since mid-October 2021 (when we started tracking mempool activity).
Live Chart
We can also see that there was a high degree of urgency associated with these transactions, as the total value of all on-chain transaction fees paid reached 3.07 BTC. This is higher than was seen during the 4-December deleveraging event, at which time the market dropped -34.5% in one day (
covered in Week 49, 2021
), and is again the largest value in our data-set to date.
Live Chart
The dominance of on-chain transaction fees associated with exchange deposits also signalled urgency, reaching the second highest value in history. This further supports the case that Bitcoin investors were seeking to de-risk, sell and/or add collateral to margin in response to market volatility.
15.2% of all on-chain transaction fees paid were associated with exchange deposit transactions, which is higher than the at the apex of the 2017 bull-run (12.1%), and surpassed only by the May 2021 sell-off (16.8%).
Live Chart
On any given day, large volumes of BTC flow both into, and out of exchanges. Exchange flows of well over $750M (in both directions, $1.5B+ total) have been a typical lower bound for the 2021-22 market cycle.
During the sell-off this week, over $3.15B in value passed in or out of exchanges, with a net bias towards inflows, which accounted for $1.60B (50.8%). This is the largest aggregate exchange related volume peak since the market was made all-time-highs in Oct-Nov last year. It is also equivalent to the inflow/outflow levels at the 2017 bull market peak.
The scale of recent history, when compared to last cycle, demonstrates just how much larger typical USD denominated capital flows are across the Bitcoin network.
Live Workbench Chart
Assessing the Off-chain Response
As noted above, the Bitcoin market has become increasingly dynamic, requiring a view of both on-chain and off-chain dynamics to establish likely drivers of price movements, market momentum, and investor sentiment.
Over the last two years, numerous spot ETF products have come to market, with three of these investment vehicles trading on Canadian exchanges. Whilst inflows to these products have generally been strong since November, the last two weeks have seen this trend reverse significantly.
On a 7-day change basis, over 6.66k BTC has flowed out of these instruments per week, which has largely corresponded with recent weakness in price.
Live Workbench Chart
In the derivatives space, Futures Open Interest has been relatively quiet given the magnitude of volatility this week. In the days leading up to the Federal Reserve announcement of rate hikes, approximately $1B in open interest entered Bitcoin futures markets.
However, much of this leverage was quickly closed out, and total open interest actually stabilised after the sell-off on Thursday, holding at around $14.3B.
Live Chart
We can see the initial whipsaw action leading up to the Federal Reserve announcement in the 1-day change of futures open interest. Open interest increased by a total of 30.4k BTC on 3-May, before 25.48k BTC in value was closed out the following day.
Whilst these values are non-trivial in size, they remain relatively small in comparison to the major deleveraging events over the last 12-months. As such, it appears less likely that excessive futures leverage was a core driver of price action this week.
Live Chart
We can add further confidence to this assessment by looking at the total liquidations occurring in futures markets. Generally speaking, during a futures market deleveraging event, we expect a large relative volume of positions being forced closed via liquidations.
However this week, at the peak of the sell-off, a maximum value of $135M in futures positions were liquidated. This represents less than 0.2% of traded futures volume. As expected, long positions took the brunt of the damage, with a 61.5% dominance of all positions liquidated. Overall, it seems that much of the recent weakness in price action is driven more by poor investor sentiment, capital outflows, and de-risking, rather than a futures driven de-leveraging.
Live Chart
Lastly, to establish a gauge on capital flows into the market, we can look to the stablecoin market. Stablecoins have been one of the primary areas of explosive growth in the industry over the last few years, and represent a primary vehicle for capital inflow and outflow.
Since the March 2020 sell-off, the aggregate supplies of the major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI) has increased from $5.33B, to over $158.25B. This is an astonishing growth of 2,866% in just over two years. USDT remains the dominant asset, accounting for 52.6% of the major supplies, and is followed by USDC at 30.8% dominance.
However since the start of April, the aggregate stablecoin supply has plateaued, and now contracted by $3.285B. This is coming off an ATH supply of $161.53B. The majority of stablecoin redemption are being driven by USDC which has declined by $4.77B since the start of March. USDT on the other hand has seen its supply continue to expand, increasing by $2.50B over the same period.
Live Workbench Chart
The chart below shows the 30-day change in aggregate stablecoin supply (blue) alongside the contribution by USDC (red).
It can be seen that particularly since May 2021, USDC has been a major contributor to total stablecoin supply growth. We can also see that this recent stablecoin supply contraction is a rare event, with the total supply contraction hitting a rate of -$2.9B per month. USDC is the primary stablecoin asset that is experiencing redemption, and this signals a degree of net capital outflow is occurring from the cryptocurrency industry at large.
Overall, there are a number of signals of net weakness in the space, many of which indicate that risk-off sentiment remains the core market position at this time.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
As the Bitcoin market matures, and more institutional capital enters the space, it has become increasingly apparent that the market responds to macroeconomic shocks, and tighter monetary conditions. Wider markets responded in a volatile manner to the Federal Reserve announcement of further rate hikes, which whilst expected, does confirm increasingly tight liquidity across markets.
This week we sought to take a holistic view of the market, assessing the response both on- and off-chain. There appears to be aggregate weakness across almost all sectors, however it does appear to be primarily driven by poor investor sentiment, and a risk-off mentality, rather than a derivatives led deleveraging. Furthermore, a significant contraction in stablecoin supplies, particularly USDC, suggests capital a net outflow from the space is underway. This supports our
recent observation of net capital outflows from derivatives markets
as available yields compress towards 2% to 3%.
Bitcoin remains highly correlated to the broader economic conditions, which suggests the road ahead may unfortunately be a rocky one, at least for the time being.

Over the course of just a few days, two top 10 digital assets by market cap (LUNA and UST) erased nearly $40 Billion in investor value. UST lost its $1 peg completely, and LUNA collapsed to a price of $0.00001 as its supply hyper-inflated. As a result, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) deployed their only recently established reserves of 80,394 BTC to defend the peg, although without success.
Later in the week, and on the momentum of UST de-pegging news, the market temporarily expressed fear over the quality of Tether's peg (USDT). USDT traded briefly down to a low of $0.9565, however recovered within 24hrs, currently trading at a very slight discount of $0.998.
Amidst the stablecoin contagion, and under the weight of $3.275 Billion worth of Bitcoin sold by the LFG, Bitcoin traded down 21.2% to $26,513. This is the lowest price since December 2020 and naturally puts much of the market under financial stress.
In this weeks newsletter we will cover these three key topics, namely:
The UST and LUNA market dynamics, what happened to LUNA and UST supplies, and how the LFG Bitcoin reserves were deployed.
The brief de-pegging of USDT, and how it affected the market perception of other stablecoins such as USDC, BUSD and DAI.
Bitcoin prices traded down towards the Realized Price, which is historically a significant support level, and the markets observable reaction to this event.

The Spectacular and Reflexive Fall of LUNA
Over the past few years, the market has seen stablecoins rise to represent a sizeable portion of the total market cap of all digital assets. On the 8-May, stablecoins captured more than $135 Billion in value between USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, and UST.
Stablecoins come in a number of flavours, but can generally be represented in three types:
Collatoralised (USDT, USDC, BUSD)
Crypto-over-collateralised (DAI)
Algorithmic (UST).
In the case of UST and LUNA, the algorithmic design allowed for users to convert 1 UST into $1 worth of LUNA (and vice-versa), irrespective of the market price of both assets. In effect, this means that the LUNA supply contracts (and price often rises) when there is demand for UST. However, this same reflexivity works in reverse, when demand falls, and prices move to the downside, the supply of LUNA can (and did) hyper-inflate.
The UST peg began to break in the 9-May, where LUNA was trading around $60 (~49.5% off the $119 ATH). Over the next 36-hours, LUNA prices fell below $0.1, and the UST peg traded between extremes of $0.30 and $0.82. This put the protocol redemption mechanism into overdrive, as users both panicked, and arbitraged the exchange of 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA, inflating the supply and depressing prices further.
At the time of writing, LUNA is now trading for $0.0002 (down 99.9998% from ATH), and UST is stabilising around $0.1251, well below the desired $1 peg.
The magnitude of LUNA supply inflation can be seen the chart below, where UST supply (green, RHS) is in linear scale, whilst LUNA supply (red, LHS) is in log scale. Over the course of one week, 7.5 Billion UST were redeemed (40% of supply), whilst the LUNA supply inflated from 343 Million, to over 6.53 Trillion, an annualised inflation rate of 99,263,840%.
At one stage on 13-May, the LUNA blockchain was even halted as a result of second order effects on network stability and governance due to the hyper-inflating supply.
The Terra blockchain has officially halted at block 7607789.
Terra Validators have halted the network to come up with a plan to reconstitute it.
More updates to come.

May 13, 2022
As the UST peg traded lower, the Luna Foundation Guard began to deploy their recently acquired Bitcoin reserves in an effort to stabilise the peg. Their total reserves had built up to 80,394 BTC over recent months, with the largest acquisitions occurring between 21 March and 5 May. The total realized value of their holdings, with coins valued at the time they were added to the wallet, was $3.275 Billion.
These wallets were completely emptied over a 21.5 hour window between the 9th and 10th of May.
Live Workbench Chart
The LFG Bitcoin balance was emptied in three tranches as shown below. The first tranche deployed around $750M in value (22,189 BTC) at 3:30 on 9-May as the UST peg traded down to $0.98. The second tranche of 30,000 BTC ($916M) was deployed 15-hours later, and the final tranche of 28,205 BTC ($873M) was emptied from the wallet 6.5hrs later.
A series of equivalently sized exchange inflows (shown in blue) occurred between 18:30 on 9-May and 01:10 on 10-May as coins were moved between custodians by the market makers engaged by LFG. By our assessment, the initial destination of these coins were:
52,189 BTC sent to to Gemini via OTC desks (which were quickly deployed elsewhere, including to Binance)
28,205 BTC sent to Binance via direct transfer
Live Workbench Chart
The LFG has since confirmed that almost all of the Bitcoin was sold, and as of 16-May, they have just 313 BTC remaining in inventory.
8/ As of now, the Foundation‚Äôs remaining reserves consist of the following assets:
¬∑ 313

May 16, 2022
Aggregate exchange balances increased by around 88k BTC over this period, which is higher than the 80,394 deployed by the LFG. This signals that these events triggered a contagion effect and panic, as Bitcoin investors added to the sell-side pressure. A large outflow occurred from Coinbase on 14-May, although it does not appear that Coinbase was a recipient venue of LFG sourced coins.
Live Chart
Unstable Coin Contagion
As if the week had not already experienced enough chaos, on 11-May, Tether (USDT) which is the largest stablecoin by market cap saw its peg come under pressure. Whilst UST was significant in size ($21B), many consider USDT at $83B in size to be systemically important to the market in its current form, being the dominant quote pair on many exchanges.
Over the period from midday 11-May to midday 12-May, USDT traded below its $1 peg to a low of $0.9565, before recovering within 36hrs to trade at a slight discount of $0.998. During this time, other major stablecoins USDC, BUSD and DAI experienced at a 1% to 2% premium as investors moved towards assets they perceived were less at risk of contagion.

Tether announced on 12-May during the worst of the peg stress that redemptions remained open and active, and that $2B worth were already underway.

If we look to the supply of USDT, we can see that indeed, over $7.485 Billion worth of USDT has been redeemed with week. The total USDT supply declined from near the $81.237B ATH to $75.75B. As we noted in
last weeks report
, the recent stablecoin supply contraction of $2.9B was the largest in history, mostly driven by USDC. As such, an outflow of this scale has now put this week into the pole position by this metric.
Live Chart
We also saw interesting supply changes across the other major stablecoin supplies this week, providing insight on market preference during times of stress. USDC reversed the trend of supply contraction that has been in place since late Feb, expanding by $2.639B. Given the dominant growth of USDC over the last 2yrs, this may be an indicator of changing market preference away from USDT and towards USDC as the preferred stablecoin.
Live Chart
The other stablecoin that saw a dramatic change in supply was DAI, which saw supply fall by 24.4%, as $2.067 Billion was burned. DAI is an over-collateralised stablecoin, backed by other digital assets deposited in the Maker protocol. The DAI supply will contract when debt holders close out their position by repaying and burning DAI.
This process can be discretionary, or forced in the event of a vault liquidation. However, despite the high volatility in collateral assets, elevated demand for DAI, and liquidation events, DAI managed to maintain a strong $1 peg, albeit trading at a very slight premium.
Live Chart
Heavy Losses Realized On-chain
As the LUNA saga unfolded, the coins acquired by LFG were spent on-chain at prices much lower than when they were purchased. With the USDT peg also coming under pressure, prices broke below the $29k support level set in July 2021. This actually put all investors from the 2021-22 cycle into a loss, and precipitated a significant and widespread net loss.
Net losses realized by all on-chain spending hit over $2.5Billion for two consecutive days, which is on par with the largest capitulation events in history (the largest if considered in aggregate).
LFG alone contributed a realized loss of $703.7M to the total aggregate. Note, this reflects losses between when the coins entered, and left the LFG wallet, and does not account for the additional losses that were taken as the BTC was traded for UST and hyper-inflating LUNA.
Live Chart
As the Bitcoin market grows in size, naturally the USD denominated losses can and will be larger over time. Thus, we can establish a 'relative realized loss' metric by dividing daily realized loss across the network by the Realized Cap to compare apples between cycles.
Here we can see that the LUNA capitulation still precipitated one of the largest loss events in the last 5 years, triggering aggregate losses equivalent to 0.28% of the Realized cap. This is comparable to:
The start and end sell-off events of the 2018 bear market
The March 2020 COVID crash
The May 2021 sell-off, which interestingly is celebrating its 1yr anniversary this week.
Live Workbench Chart
Realized Price Within Reach
The Realized Price is one of the oldest, and most fundamental metric concepts in on-chain analysis. It is calculated by dividing the Realized Cap, which is the sum of all coin values at the time when they were last moved, by the circulating supply.
Thus it reflects an estimate of the aggregate cost basis of all coins in the supply.
Historically, the Realized Price has provided sound support during bear markets, and has provided signals of market bottom formation when the market price trades below it. The table below shows the previous bear market cycles, and the proportion of time where prices traded below the realized price.
It can be seen that over time, each bear cycle has spent less relative duration below the realized price. This may be in part a result of general market awareness of its existence (it was first discovered
in 2018
). March 2020 remains the most notable deviation, with just 7-days spent below the realized price, rather than months as seen in prior cycles.
As the market hit the weekly price low of $26,513, the Realized Price was trading at $24k. As the market collapsed under the weight of LFGs BTC sales, the destruction of value held in LUNA and UST, and the depeg fear of Tether, spot prices fell within 9.5% of the Realized Price.
As a result of the aggregate realized losses described above, the Realized Cap declined by $7.92 Billion, representing a capital outflow from the Bitcoin network, and causing the Realized Price to decline by $60 to $23,940.
Live Chart
Despite the volatility however, the bulls in the market appeared to responded strongly as prices fell towards a the Realized Price. The chart and table below show the Accumulation Trend Score, which will return values closer to 1 when a large proportion of the market are adding to their on-chain balances.
On Thursday 12-May, when the market was at the lowest, the Accumulation Trend Score reversed from very weak values below 0.3, to return values upwards of 0.796. Supporting the Bitcoin price bounce back into the $30ks, the Score returned values above 0.9 for the remainder of the week, suggesting strong buy side activity took place.
Live Chart
This can be further confirmed looking at the various wallet cohorts that participated. What we can see is a swift reversal from weak accumulation (< 0.3, warm colours) across all cohorts in early May, to strong accumulation across most cohorts this week (> 0.7, cool colours).
Small holders (< 1BTC) were by far the largest accumulators, and were supported by whales with more than 10k BTC (which includes the LFG balance which was completely distributive). Wallet cohorts holding 100 BTC to 10k BTC remained weaker in their net accumulation.
The takeaway observation is that whilst exchange balances ticked higher, realized losses were taken at a historical scale, and LFG unloaded 80k BTC, the aggregate market still added to their balance. This offset distribution impacts that will have weighed heavily on the Accumulation Trend Score over the last week.

Summary and Conclusions
What happened this week was historic in nature, however in many ways, aligns with the characteristics of a textbook digital asset bear market. There have been various examples of large name cryptocurrency projects that turned out to be unstable, and ultimately collapse under their own weight. Such events are usually precipitated by the downwards price pressure of a bear market, as demand wanes, and experimental systems (which are often leveraged) come under stress.
As stablecoins become increasingly integrated as base layer infrastructure in the market, the shockwaves of a de-pegging event, especially in the largest stablecoin USDT will have widespread impacts. The double momentum from UST and USDT depegging, some $40B in LUNA/UST value destroyed, and with LFG adding 80k BTC sell-pressure created a perfect storm. This event will also no doubt attract the regulatory spotlight at a greater pace and urgency.
It remains to be seen if a full return to the Realized Price is required to put this bear market to rest, and if so whether it is for months, weeks, days or just a short a moment. Perhaps those days are behind us if the accumulation we observed is indicative of the support the bulls are willing to put up in the $20ks range. Note also, there remains a plethora of macro, inflationary and monetary policy forces acting as headwinds. The road ahead will likely continue to be a rocky one.

Bitcoin prices traded within a relatively tight range between a high of $31,300 and a low of $28,713.
The Bitcoin market has now traded lower for eight consecutive weeks, which is now the longest continuous string of red weekly candles in history. This week we will look towards the return profile on both a short-term (monthly) and long-term (4yrs) basis for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. From this, we can see that the current drawdown has put a notable dent in the market performance of the asset-class as a whole.
Furthermore, an assessment of derivative markets suggests fear of further downside remains the outlook, at least for the next three to six months. Looking on-chain, we can see that both Ethereum and Bitcoin blockspace demand has fallen to multi-year lows, and the rate of burning of ETH via EIP1559 is now at an all-time-low.
Coupling poor price performance, fearful derivatives pricing, and exceedingly lacklustre demand for block-space on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, we can deduce that the demand side is likely to continue seeing headwinds.

Are Returns for BTC and ETH Diminishing?
There has been a general consensus formed that with growing market valuation, the return profiles for Bitcoin can generally be expected to diminish. This reflects a number of factors that include (but not limited to):
Larger market sizes requiring more capital to move in either direction.
Introduction of institutional capital, more advanced trading strategies, and derivatives for hedging and capturing volatility.
Compression of information asymmetries, and a better appreciation of risk, performance, correlations and cycle behaviour.
Bitcoin has historically traded within an approximately 4yr bull/bear cycle, often associated with the halving events. The chart below plots out the rolling 4yr Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for Bitcoin.
We can now visualise this long-term compression of returns, with CAGR having declined from 200%+ in 2015, to less than 50% today. In particular, we can see the marked decline in 4y-CAGR following the May 2021 sell-off, which
we have argued
was likely the genesis point of the prevailing bear market trend.
Live Workbench Chart
In the shorter term, we can also see that the Monthly Return profile for Bitcoin has been underwhelming, with a negative performance of -30%. In effect, Bitcoin has lost 1% of its market value every day over the last month.
This negative return is now marginally worse than it was during the 4-Dec deleveraging, but not quite as severe as in May-July. Periods of time with monthly returns this lacklustre are relatively infrequent, however are almost always associated with high volatility drawdown events such as the beginning, and ends of bear markets.
Live Chart
We can see a very similar return profile for Ethereum over recent months, although with relatively poorer performance of -34.9%. This demonstrates that correlation of performance between these two assets remains strong, despite numerous differences in their fundamental properties.
Live Chart
Further to this, we can see an interesting coupling between Bitcoin and Ethereum CAGR performance, specifically during bearish trends. In the post March 2020 period of uncertainty, and again since the bear began in May 2021, the CAGR profiles of both assets have converged. Ethereum appears to also be experiencing a diminishing return profile over time.
ETH has generally outperformed BTC during bullish trends, however these divergences do appear to be getting weaker over time (lower upwards divergences). In more bearish trends, it can be seen that the ETH CAGR often tends to underperform BTC.
Over the last 12-months, the 4yr CAGR for both assets has declined from around 100%/yr to just 36%/yr for BTC, and 28%/yr for ETH, highlighting the severity of this bear.
Live Workbench Chart
Whilst Bitcoin remains the largest digital asset by market valuation, it exists within an ever evolving ecosystem of blockchains, coins, protocols, and tokens. Ethereum, being the second market leader for many years now, is often viewed as a bell-weather of market appetite for rest of the digital asset risk curve.
A popular tool for tracking this relative performance and sector rotation is 'Bitcoin Dominance'. The dominance variant below considers only the relative performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum Market Caps. This attempts to distil this macro 'sector rotation' into very specific large-cap relative performance metric. From this we can make a few observations:
Declining BTC Dominance Divergence (green arrows)
is typical of early-mid stage bull markets, as investors start moving further out on the risk curve.
Rising BTC Dominance Divergence (red arrows)
is typical of earlier stage bear markets where risk appetite declines, and Bitcoin tends to outperform.
In the current market, and following the Nov ATH, we have seen a developing divergence in favour of BTC dominance. Given the negative attention drawn to the digital asset risk curve by the collapse of LUNA and UST, this trend may be one to keep track of. It should be noted that Ethereum dominance has remained higher for longer relative to the 2018 bear market, suggesting an improved market appreciation of ETH with age and maturity.
Live Workbench Chart
Derivatives Expecting Further Downside
Moving over to the derivatives markets, we can see another coupling between BTC and ETH exists, this time in futures cash-and-carry yields. Throughout the 2020-22 cycle, an approximately equal 3M rolling yield could be obtained from both assets, with very few periods of divergence. This is another data-point suggesting traders are taking advantage of any and all yield available in the market, wherever liquidity and trade volume allow it.
At present, the 3M rolling basis yield is around 3.1% for both assets, which is historically very low. However, this is now higher than the US 10yr Treasury yield of 2.78%, which may start giving
capital a reason to re-enter the space
.
Live Workbench Chart
That said, options markets continue to price in near-term uncertainty, and downside risk, especially over the next three to six months. Implied volatility experienced a significant increase last week during the market sell-off. Short-dated at-the-money options saw IV more than double, from 50% to 110%, whilst 6-month dated option IV jumped to 75%. This is a break higher from what has been a long period of very low implied IV levels.
Live Chart
With such a heavy bear market in play, and with such poor price performance, it is no surprise that the market has a notable preference for Put options. The Put/Call Ratio for open interest has increased from 50% to 70% over the last two weeks, as the market seeks to hedge further downside risk.
Live Chart
Looking out to the end of Q2, we can see a heavy preference for Put options, with key strike prices of $25k, $20k, and $15k. The pool of open Call options is significantly lower, with open interest mostly concentrating around the $40k strike price.
This suggests that at least out to the middle of the year, the market has a strong preference for hedging risk, and/or speculating on further downside price action.
Live Chart
However on a longer-term basis, options open interest at the end of the year is notably more constructive. There is a clear preference for call options, with concentration around strike prices of $70k to $100k. Furthermore, the dominant put option strike prices are at $25k and $30k, which are at higher price levels than the mid-year.
Thus, based on the spread of options open interest, it appears that the market is quite uncertain about the immediate term (2-3months) in particular. Speculators do however seem to be taking advantage of lower implied volatility, and taking on a more constructive view out to years end.
Live Chart
On-chain Ghost-towns
Perhaps in strong confluence with the near term fear expressed in derivatives markets, the on-chain activity of both Bitcoin and Ethereum remains unimpressive. Ultimately, high demand for blockspace and utilisation of a network generally manifests as network congestion, and transaction fees spiking. Whilst Bitcoin did see a 2x bump in total fees paid last week during the volatility, it has been languishing around 10-12BTC per day since May 2021.
Note, we covered more of the nuance leading to a low Bitcoin on-chain
fee regime in Week 15
, although a lack of demand for blockspace remains a primary driver.
Live Chart
Despite having a fairly lively blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum too has seen blockspace demand dry up significantly. Whilst the network sports a great many applications, financial protocols, and tokens, mean gas prices on Ethereum have still fallen, now at just 26.2 Gwei.
With the exception of a few spikes during high profile NFT mints, and the sell-off last week, Ethereum gas prices have been in a structural downtrend since December. Mean gas prices this low are at levels coincident with the May-July 2021 lows, and the post March 2020 uncertainty period.
Live Chart
A knock on effect of lower demand for Ethereum blockspace is a net reduction in the number of ETH coins burned via the EIP1559 protocol implementation. After hitting an ATH of 38,940 ETH/day burned during the Bored Ape Yacht Club 'Otherside' NFT mint, the burn rate is now at an all-time-low.
This week, 2,370 ETH were burned, which is a 50% reduction compared to the start of May, and represents a burn rate of 18.4% of the minted supply (i.e. 81.6% of minted ETH is entering circulation). Whilst burning 18.4% is more than 0%, it is possible additional coins entering the supply, during weakened incoming demand can be a headwind for prices.
Live Workbench Chart
To close out on the relative demand for Ethereum blockspace, we can review the on-chain activity associated with popular DeFi tokens; AAVE, COMP, UNI and YFI. The charts below shows the number of active addresses interacting with these tokens, and the USD denominated volume transferred in each. These are relatively simple metrics and comparisons, however the relationships to price performance are quite apparent.
What we see is a strong correlation between on-chain activity and DeFi token price performance, and at present both remain fairly uninspiring across the board. There was a slight uptick in activity last week, but it remains to be seen if this is a reversal of trend, or a flash in the pan.
Live Dashboard
Summary and Conclusions
Bear markets can take their toll, and this particular bear has done just that. Until the market approaches some form of sustained bottom, bears usually get worse before they get better. What we have observed in the sections above is a relatively cohesive story of poor price performance, diminishing long-term returns, fear being priced into near-term derivative markets, and a side of lacklustre on-chain activity.
This effect is relatively universal across the digital asset market, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing dramatically lower utilisation and demand relative to the bull market. For DeFi tokens, even more so. There are signals that internal capital rotation is towards BTC at this time, perhaps punctuated by the LUNA and UST collapse last week. Such a rotation is a historical characteristic of bear markets, as investors move towards perceived safer assets.
With that said, the last 12-months of price performance of the industry relative to the US Dollar remains unfortunate, and this bear has made a non-trivial dent in long-term return profiles.
Nevertheless, bear markets do have a way of ending, perhaps just not right now. As the saying goes however, 'bear markets author the bull that follows'.

The S&P500 index rallied 7.4% from the lows this week, and the NASDAQ was up 9.6%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traded down to a low of $28,261, and only rallied early on Monday to recover the weekly high of $30,710. Ethereum also had a tough week, shedding 17.8% of its value to a low of $1,700, before rebounding to $1,900 on Monday morning.
After the LUNA motivated sell-off event earlier in the month, there has been a distinct behavioural change in Bitcoin on-chain accumulation trends. In particular, entities with balances < 100 BTC, and those with >10k BTC have been significant accumulators. The remaining wallet cohorts have also transitioned from net distributors, to neutral. This reflects a notable shift in behaviour compared to the Feb-mid May period which was intermittent accumulation and distribution, reflecting uncertainty and a
rotating capital
.
However, on-chain activity remains extremely soft, with little signal of new interest in the asset outside the existing HODLer base. That said, the HODLers who remain, appear to be willing to double down as prices fall, and remain unwilling to spend coins, even if held at a loss.

Only the HODLers Remain
Over recent months, we have highlighted how the on-chain activity for Bitcoin remains both lacklustre, and stable. This is a typical characteristic of past bear markets, where the transaction activity of the network is dominated by the HODLer class, who are far more price insensitive.
After the May 2021 sell-off, we witnessed a modest 'purge' of wallets, as investors completely emptied out their coin holdings. This was followed by four month long plateau in wallet growth as uncertainty crept into investor psychology, and marginal buyers were flushed out of the market by the drawdown.
As we can see in the chart below, the poor price performance of late has put wallet growth on a near term pause, although not on the same scale as in May 2021.
Live Chart
During highly volatile events like the LUNA inspired sell-off, we often see an uptick in on-chain activity, as investors panic, sell, or otherwise move coins to post margin and cover positions. In March 2020 and November 2018, this upswing in activity post sell-off initiated the subsequent bull runs.
Whilst this possibility cannot be ruled out, we can see that both Active Addresses and Entities have 'given back' all of this upswing in activity, and returned to the range established since Sept 2021. In other words, the recent sell-off, and lower prices has not yet inspired an influx of new users to the space, and only the HODLers remain.
Live Workbench Chart
A Shift in Accumulation Behaviour
Of course on-chain activity is only a part of the story. Whilst wallet growth and active entities may be stagnant, this analysis does not account for the economic value of the investors and wallets that remain. As prices correct lower, the ability for HODLers to acquire more BTC per dollar increases, which leads us to investigate the domain of supply dynamics.
The Accumulation Trend Score has seen a noteworthy shift in behaviour. For almost 2-weeks, it has returned near perfect score above 0.9. This indicates that existing entities on the network are adding significantly to their holdings. This is a clear break from the intermittent scores returned during the Jan-April consolidation range (orange) which can reasonably be classified as relatively low conviction accumulation.
Previous instances of sustained high accumulation trend scores fall into two buckets:
High scores during a bull-run (blue)
- which usually occur near tops as the smart money distribute their balance, but are matched with an even larger influx of less experienced new buyers.
High scores during bearish trends (green)
- which generally trigger after very significant corrections in price, as investor psychology shifts from uncertainty, to value accumulation. A notable exception is the post ATH period of Dec 2021 where 'the dip' turned out to not be THE dip, and many of these
coins were redistributed lower
at a loss.
Live Chart
If we dissect the various wallet cohorts whom are contributing to this high accumulation score, we can identify two particular groups: entities with <100 BTC, and entities with >10k BTC.
Inspecting the former, we can see that the gradient of their aggregate wallet holdings increased following the recent sell-off. Furthermore, the aggregate balance of this cohort has increased by 80,724 BTC, remarkably similar to the
net 80,081 BTC
liquidated by the LUNA Foundation Guard (
details here
). In effect, the increased demand from < 100 BTC entities at lower prices has offset in the supply liquidated by LFG in the attempt to defend the UST peg.
Live Workbench Chart
The other cohort which has contributed to the high Accumulation Trend Score are whales with > 10k BTC holdings. Over the course of May, these entities have added 46,269 BTC to their balance, and note that this includes the distribution of 80k BTC from the LFG wallet.
Live Workbench Chart
These observations can be largely confirmed by inspection of the Accumulation Trend Score breakdown by wallet cohorts metric. Here we can see that since the sell-off, entities holding < 100 BTC and >10k BTC have returned blue signals indicating a significant increase to their balance in recent weeks.
This is a notable shift from the relatively weak values (yellow-red) during the lead-up to the sell-off, with Whales in particular being large scale distributors. The remaining wallet cohorts with 100-10k BTC have maintained a more neutral rating around 0.5, suggesting relatively little net change to their holdings.
In the next section, we will investigate the behaviour of the Long-term Holders to further refine our observations.

Long-Term Losses
We have now established a case for the various wallet size cohorts that participated in recent accumulation on-chain. Next we turn to the Long-Term Holders, whom represent the least likely to spend during volatility to gauge investor conviction. Note that the transition into Long-Term Holder status is approximately 155-days ago, which is located in late December when prices were at ~$47k.
If we take a look at the URPD metric on 1-Apr-2022, prior to the LUNA sell-off, we can map out the coin distribution profile with a focus on on the 2021-22 cycle.
Live Chart
We now bring this 1-Apr profile and overlay it with today's URPD in blue below. From this we can assess the change in coin distribution and make the following observations:
A sizeable reallocation of 1.5M BTC has occurred from buyers largely in the $42k to $49k range, down to buyers in the current range of $26.7k to $33k.
The coin distribution elsewhere remains remarkably similar to the 1-Apr profile, suggesting the relatively price insensitive HODLer cohort continues to dominate the Bitcoin investor profile.
Live Chart
The current downtrend in coins younger than 3-months supports this observation. Looking back 3-months captures all coins last spent after 1-March, which is the middle the last consolidation range. When a downtrend in 3m old HODL waves is in effect, it means that on net, coin supply is migrating up to more senior age bans.
The key takeaway from these two metrics is that the coin holders who accumulated after the Nov ATH appear to be relatively price insensitive. Despite continued drawdowns in price, and a major spot liquidation event of 80k+ BTC, they remain unwilling to let their coins go.
Live Chart
Recalling that the Long-Term Holder threshold is located in late-December, it is no surprise that the total LTH supply has plateaued of late. For the last few months, the LTH threshold was traversing along the downtrend that was in play from Nov-Jan.
Typically, supply accumulation occurs during sideways price ranges. This means that in around 1-month time, the LTH threshold will enter the previous consolidation range established between $33k and $42k. Based on the URPD profile, a very large volume of supply was acquired here between January and April.
Long-Term Holder supply has recently returned to the ATH of 13.048M BTC. Unless significant coin redistribution occurs, we can therefore expect this supply metric to commence climbing over the course of the next 3-4 months, suggesting HODLers continue to gradually soak up, and hold onto supply.
Live Chart
However, despite the constructive forward view, there remains a sub-set of LTHs whom are currently spending coins and realizing losses. The LTH-SOPR metric can be viewed as the average profit multiple realized by the LTH cohort each day, and it rarely trades below 1.0.
This week, we have seen the average LTH spent coin locking in a 27% loss compared to the point of coin acquisition. Such events in the past have only occurred during the final capitulation lows of bear markets such as 2015, 2018 and briefly in March 2020.
Live Chart
With the concept of LTH-SOPR as a realized profit multiple, we can thus derive the average price from where LTH spent coins are 'coming from', termed the Spent Price. The LTH Spent Price (pink) rarely trades above the market price, but however is currently trading at $32.8k on a 7-day moving average basis. The last time LTHs locked in losses like this was briefly following the March 2020 sell-off event. In the case of the 2018 bear, this preceded many months of LTH losses and culminated in an additional 50% price decline.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The plateauing on-chain activity for Bitcoin has been in effect since September 2021, and as yet, there are few signs of this changing course. What this indicates is that the HODLer class, the Bitcoin buyers of last resort, and the only ones that remain. This can also be observed in the unwillingness to spend held supply, even if it is now held at a loss.
A notable shift occurred in on-chain accumulation trends following the LUNA induced sell-off. Entities with < 100BTC appear to have soaked up an equivalent coin volume to that sold in distress by the Luna Foundation Guard. Alongside a majority of Long-Term Holders an increasingly large volume of BTC appears HODLed and acquired at these lower prices. This trend, unless disrupted, can be expected to propel Long-Term Holder supply above its ATH over the coming months.
Keeping both eyes on the macro environment which Bitcoin remains within, there are signals of a decoupling between digital assets and equities. Whether renewed correlation returns remains to be seen, and as does the ultimate direction of markets in reaction to monetary tightening. Risks of significant scale remain, however, impressively, ¬†so does the population of price insensitive Bitcoin HODLers.

New Research: A Short History of the Etherverse
Ethereum is a permissionless platform, and as such, doesn't have an inherent purpose that is enforceable. In any meaningful sense, a permissionless platform is defined empirically by its usage. Our latest research piece explores the Etherverse from the perspective of the market share captured by various use cases in relation to on-chain transactions, and gas consumption.

A Short History of the Etherverse"
2022,23,2022-W23,2022-06-06,2022-06-12,Bearish,31343.61,26555.20,29530.58,-15.28,Agree,"Coming out of a bloody nine consecutive red weeks, the market closed its first weekly candle in the green, albeit with a relatively uninspiring weekly gain of 1.57%. The market traded between a weekly high of $31,900 and a low of $29,375.
With prices trading at the lower end of the 2021-22 cycle range, the vast majority of buyers from the last 17-months are now holding unrealized losses. The intensity of this uncertainty and stress in the market is observable in on-chain data, with a continual reliance on Long-Term Holders to shoulder the load.
We are also seeing miner revenues decline substantially, despite the climbing difficulty. This suggests that miner operations have expanded, capital has been spent, and production costs have increased as revenues are falling off. As profit multiples compress across the board and financial stress increases, the highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a Bitcoin bear market.

Historical Macro Lows
Among all models mapping the value zones in Bitcoin market, two simple but powerful indicators have been utilized widely by analysts alike; the
Mayer Multiple
and
Realized Price
.
The
Mayer Multiple
is an oscillator defined as the ratio between price and the 200-day moving average. Therefore the Mayer Multiple represents the deviation from this long-term average price as a tool to gauge overbought and oversold conditions incorporating data points encompassing Bitcoin‚Äôs lifespan.
Following the original analysis, oversold or undervalued conditions have coincided with the Mayer Multiple falling in the range of 0.6-0.8. These multiples are applied to the 200DMA in the following chart to demonstrate the undervalued zones according to Mayer Multiple; 0.6 MM < Price < 0.8 MM.
Throughout the past four bear markets, market prices have entered this value range in two distinguishable phases:
Phase
A-
Early in the bear market, as the initial post-ATH sell-off causes investors to panic
Phase
B
Late-stage bear market as the market enters the bottom formation and capitulation
In the current market, prices have been hovering inside this value zone ($25,200 to $33,700) since 5-May, more closely resembling Phase B of the previous bear cycles. From a probabilistic view, Bitcoin prices have only closed below a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 for 7.9% of trading days.
Live Workbench
The
Realized Price Model
is the former macro indicator to map the cycle bottoms. The Realized Price is currently trading at $23,600 and represents the estimated average cost basis of all coins in the Bitcoin supply, based on the price when they last moved on-chain. In previous bear market cycles, when spot prices traded below the Realized Price, it signalled elevated probabilities of a macro low being established.
Historically, the overall market cost basis or realized price has been a very sound cycle support level, with 84.9% of Bitcoin trading days closing above this level. In other words, only 15.1% of trading days have closed below the Realized Price, providing a similar confluence with the Mayer Multiple of 0.8.
Live Workbench
A Prolonged Bear Market & Profitability
Having now assessed past bear market structure to model a potential cycle bottom zone, the confidence of this claim can be queried by quantifying the degree of ‚ÄòBear Market pain‚Äô felt across the network. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric maps out the overall unrealized profit and loss of the network as a proportion of the market cap. Thus NUPL can be used as a compass to assess this market pain threshold.
Since early May, the NUPL has fluctuated in a compressed range of 18.6% to 25.0%, indicating less than 25% of the market cap is held in profit. This resembles a market structure equivalent to pre-capitulation phases in previous bear markets. In the event of a capitulation, the NUPL has usually traded down to an unrealized loss of up to -25% times the Market Cap. Given the current realized price of $23,600, the matching price range of $23,600 to $20,560 is where NUPL would imply a full-scale capitulation scenario.
It is worth noting that NUPL cycle lows have been gradually climbing as a result of both lost and long HODLed coins. This impact may well be further intensified by the introduction of derivatives, which enable the hedging of risk without selling spot exposure.
Live Chart
Since NUPL tracks the unrealized profit and loss in the market, we can supplement with an investigation of the Realized Losses to gauge the actual investor response. Here, the
Cumulative Realized Loss (90D)
is presented as a ratio with the Realized Cap to normalize for market size. Consistent with the highlighted two-phase bear market pattern in the Mayer Multiple models, the cumulative realized loss chart also is denoting two stages in a bear market.
The early wave of losses of the current cycle has already been realized via the post ATH crash in May-July 2021 (phase A). At the moment, the market is experiencing phase B where the probability of a capitulation event taking place is elevated, and sustained losses are being realized on-chain.
Live Workbench
Long-Term Holders Shoulder Losses
One of the outstanding trends of a bear market is the diminishing share of short-term holders (STHs), as speculators are flushed from the market. As a result, STHs end up holding fewer coins, and Long-Term Holders accumulate and dominate the circulating supply. This trend is the result of two parallel events occurring during a bear market:
Phase A
: Short-term holders who purchased near the top are immediately plunged into a loss, reducing their overall Supply in Profit.
Phase B:
Long-Term Holder accumulation persists during the bear, despite prices pushing their newly acquired coins into an unrealized loss.
At the moment, almost 58% of the circulating supply is in profit while in the last three market capitulations this metric fell down to <50% levels. STH-Supply in profit is just 2.2% meaning the short-term holders are almost entirely at a loss. Meanwhile, LTHs have seen their share of profitable supply drop from 68.5% in April to 55.7% today, indicating they are currently shouldering much of the market's unrealized losses.
Live Chart
To add a new dimension to this observation, we can look into the share of
Supply in Profit Held By Long-Term Holders.
Here, the growing dominance of long-term holders (or diminishing share of short-term holders) through the late stages of a bear market are noticeable.
In the last two extended bear markets, the 14 DMA of this metric broke above the 90% threshold line. This means under the psychological pressure of bearish price action, short-term holders were holding < 10% of the profit in the market. With the recent leg down to sub $30K range, this metric crossed over the 90% threshold. Above this level, STHs have essentially reached a near-peak pain threshold, with almost no unrealized profits held while LTHs dominating the remaining profitable supply.
Live Workbench
Moreover, the examination of the unrealized loss distribution among LTHs and STHs suggests the following findings of the current cycle:
Price currently is trading at the lows of the 2021-2022 cycle, which means almost all buyers since Jan-2021 are now holding unrealized losses.
The LTH supply in loss has been increasing since May 2021 but has since plateaued at 26% of supply (vs. STHs with 16%). This indicates that LTHs are shouldering more of the unrealized losses (a constructive reshuffling of coin ownership), and currently holds around 62% of the 2021-22 cycle supply in loss (26% / (26%+16%)).
STH Supply in loss is also approximately stable, oscillating around 16% to 18% of supply. Note that 155-days ago (1-Jan-2022) the price was $47k. Thus the majority of STHs accumulated throughout the previous consolidation range in Q1 2022.
Live Chart
The behavioural analysis of the LTHs under pressure would not be concluded without examining their reaction to intense price corrections. Here we will inspect the
Return Bands of Long-Term Holders‚Äô Realized Profit & Loss
metric, specifically for coins deposited into exchanges. In the 2018-19 bear market and the March 2020 Covid crash, the aggregated realized loss exceeded 0.006% of the market cap. This pattern has now reoccurred during the plunge below $30K in early May. To lay a foundation for this investigation, we should emphasize that:
The LTH losses on coins deposited to exchanges have now reached a magnitude comparable to previous bear markets. However,
we do not yet have the duration component
, and also the drawdown magnitude is 58% relative to previous >75% drawdowns.
Miner Earnings Under Stress
After determining the severity of the current bear market and exploring the long-term holders‚Äô corresponding behaviour, we will now assess the reaction of miners to declining incomes.
To lay a foundation for this analysis we first have to quantify the profitability of the market from the miners‚Äô perspective. The
Puell Multiple
is the ratio of the daily issuance value of bitcoin (in USD) to the 365-day moving average of this value.
Assessing the entire history of Puell Multiple, the two-phase-bear market narrative outlined above is also evident here. At the early stages of the bear market, the Puell Multiple typically falls into the range of 0.6 to 1.0, indicating current incomes are up to 40% lower than the last year on average. Subsequently, in the later stages of a prolonged bear market where the capitulation events tend to take place, the Puell Multiple plunges to the sub-0.5 zone.
This metric is currently sitting at 0.66, on the edge of entering the capitulation range. Taking the high correlation between this indicator and price into account, a price decline of -10% or more would indicate widespread stress on miner income streams.
Live Chart
In reaction to the prevailing decline in USD incomes since November 2021, we can observe miner balances declining and additional spending taking place. The Miner Net Position Change metric is currently indicating an aggregate miner balance reduction of between 5k and 8k BTC per month.
Live Chart
This signals a distinct change in miner behaviour, as their balance had seen a net accumulation of around 12k BTC during the first drawdown from ATH. In response to the market crash due to
LUNA Foundation selling over 80k BTC in an attempt to maintain the UST peg
, miners have since distributed 10k BTC adding to the selling pressure in the market.
Live Chart
A Chronological Divergence
An intriguing divergence to discuss is the continued climbing of network difficulty, which has risen by 132% since the ATH, despite the financial incentive of total miner revenue dropping by 56.7%. This substantial jump in difficulty suggests that existing miners have expanded their operations, and new miners have joined the network despite a massive income reduction. As such it is likely that recent capital expenses on mining hardware and facilities could add continued pressure to miners‚Äô balance sheets.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
Based on the Mayer Multiple, and the Realized Price, the market has now pushed Bitcoin prices down to levels that have been seen for less than 15% of Bitcoins trading days.
Network unrealized losses are hovering in the twilight zone of late-stage bear markets, however, are not yet signalling complete capitulation. With prices at the lower bound of the 2021-22 cycle, all buyers since 1-Jan-2021 are now underwater.
Long-Term Holders are currently shouldering the majority (62%) of unrealized losses, signifying that a gradual but constructive change of ownership has taken place throughout this bear market.
Miners appear to be increasingly under stress, with signs of both balance sheet reduction alongside recent operation expansion expressed through rising difficulty. This means that each coin is now more expensive to mine, whilst the USD denominated reward continues to decline and may portend a potential miner capitulation cycle ahead.

Macro headwinds remain a large scale driver, with the latest US CPI print of 8.6% being above expectations and another 2y-10y US Treasury Bond yield curve inversion occurring in the early hours on Monday. This has been met with a large rally in the DXY, as Bitcoin closes with its 10th red candle in 11 weeks.
Bitcoin network utility continues to languish, with macro metrics like the RVT entering the uncharted bearish territory. Despite continued accumulation across Shrimps (< 1BTC) and Whales (> 10k BTC) alike, price support remains far from established. Despite many macro valuation metrics continuing to flag oversold conditions, Bitcoin remains correlated with traditional markets, with prices taking a beating accordingly.
In this edition, we explore how the current bear market is now entering a phase aligned with the deepest and darkest phases of previous bears. The market on average is barely above its cost basis, and even Long-Term Holders are now being purged from the holder base.

A Meeting With The Cost Basis
With the market trading into the mid-$20k region, it is approaching one of the most significant and fundamental on-chain metrics, the Realized Price. This metric represents the average price of every coin in the supply, valued at the time it was last spent on-chain.
The Realized Price (at $23,430) is rarely visited by spot prices outside the deepest and latest stages of bear markets. March 2020, and the end of the 2018 bear market were the last instances where the market was on aggregate holding an unrealized loss.
Live Chart
The MVRV Z-Score then compares this spot value of Bitcoin against Realized Price to obtain an oscillator. This tool can help to identify statistically meaningful deviations away from this ‚Äòintrinsic value‚Äô and is used to assess over and undervalued conditions.
Values equal to the mean (black line) typically align with these deep late stage bears. The current market has now fallen to just +0.26 standard deviations above the mean, which historically would be considered a value zone, especially so when weighted for an upwards drift in Z-score.
Nevertheless, past bear cycles have shown that negative MVRV-Z values are often seen before a bear market concludes and can persist in that state for some time (order of months in 2018 to a year IN 2015).
Live Workbench
Bitcoin HODLers Soften Up
Within the structural downtrend that has been in place since November, we have seen a variety of behavioural phases and Bitcoin spending behaviour taking place. We can use these changes in behaviour to gauge how aggregated investor sentiment has changed.
The
Accumulation Trend Score
is a useful tool to observe these changes by assessing the magnitude and duration of on-chain Bitcoin balance growth or contraction. It displays the aggregate accumulation/distribution weighted for all cohorts.
Dec 2020 to Jan 2021
- Bull market buying, as investors entered the market and created the bullish impulse to the then $64k ATH.
Jan 2021 to Oct 2021
- Softening and general distribution, in part a result of declining spot demand after the GBTC premium turned to a discount (
covered in our report here
)
Oct 2021 to Jan 2022
- Post ATH buying demand which was later redistributed (
as covered in Week 9, 2022
)
Jan 2022 to May 2022
- Intermittent accumulation and distribution, culminating in the LUNA-UST motivated sell-off (as covered in
Week 20, 2022
).
In the current market, we have seen one month with an Accumulation Trend Score north of 0.8, signifying high positive balance changes across the market. This is a notable shift from the intermittent accumulation before the LUNA sell-off and may suggest an improved investor perception of value at prices at and below $30k.
Live Workbench
We can also look toward the
Liveliness
metric to understand the market preference for HODLing or distributional behaviour. Liveliness defines the balance between aggregate Coin Day Destruction and Coin Day Creation. It can therefore be used to provide confluence with destruction and accumulation regimes.
Liveliness has remained in a structural downtrend since August 21. Bitcoin is firmly within a regime of aggregate Coin Day Creation as HODLing dominates. However, as we have explored
in previous editions
, with only the HODLer class remaining, their demand side remains too light to contain the current action sell-side.
Live Chart
We can further confirm this by assessing the 3-month position change for Liveliness (shown in purple below). A general accumulation range can also be highlighted since the Great Miner Migration in Jul 2021. However, this Coin Day Creation regime is losing momentum and trending toward an equilibrium position based on the current trend. This reflects the general uncertainty in markets, which is resulting in increased investor de-risking of spot positions.
Live Workbench
The HODLer net position change brings these observations into the supply domain, and can be used to estimate the magnitude of coin volume HODLer base is accumulating or distributing. This metric indicates that based on the degree of coin dormancy at present, approximately 15k-20k BTC per month are transitioning into the hands of Bitcoin HODLers. This has declined by around 64% since early May, suggesting a weakening accumulation response.
Live Chart
We have seen changing phases of investor conviction and spending behaviour over the last 18-months. In particular, we have identified that in both instances at the $30k level (May-July 2021 and currently), the investor buy-side sentiment appears to be stronger than any other price level in this cycle.
A Bifurcated Market
We have established that investors do appear to perceive value in the sub-$30k region, despite this demand being insufficient thus far in providing price support. Next will break down which cohorts have been participating in the accumulation to further refine these observations.
The Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort allows a more granular assessment into which wallet-size cohorts are accumulating/distributing and to what degree.
Shrimps (<1 BTC) and Whales
(>10k BTC, excl. exchanges and miners)
cohorts have been aggressively accumulating since the price slump into the $25k-$32k range. This remains in effect throughout the last 2 months of depressed prices.
Crabs to Sharks (1 to 100 BTC)
cohorts have transitioned from a neutral to a distributive phase during the current sell-off. This suggests a potential decline in confidence.
Thus the near-perfect scores of 0.9+ seen in the Accumulation Trend Score over recent weeks are being driven by the very large (>10k BTC) and relatively small (<1 BTC) cohorts. It is interesting to note that the whale entities were the driving distributors at the $45k to $35k levels (Zone A) and are currently one of the prime accumulators in the $25k to $32k range (Zone B).
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room
Next, we can assess the 30-day rate of change of supply held by shrimp addresses with less than 1 BTC. The 30-day rate of change provides insight into the raw position change to the number of coins held by this smaller and likely retail-level cohort of investors.
Although the current rate of balance growth is waning, it was preceded by the most aggressive and consistent accumulation period post-Bitcoin‚Äôs initial rise in the last 18-months. These smallholders have seen a net balance growth of +20,863 Bitcoin since the May 9th Luna crash, providing confluence with Accumulation Trend Score by Cohort
.
Live Workbench
On an absolute magnitude basis, Shrimps have added +96.3k BTC to their holdings since the Nov ATH. This equates to 0.451% of the circulating supply, and 48.6% of new coin issuance over the same period.
We can visibly see the steepening positive gradient of shrimp owned supply. These small holders appear unfazed, rightly or wrongly, by the prevailing downtrend, as they continue to constantly accumulate spot BTC.
Live Chart
The other cohort of interest to assess is the 10k+ BTC Whale cohort. Looking at the monthly position change of their addresses, we can support our previous observations that the cohort has also been accumulating throughout the $25k-$32k price range. This cohort has a monthly position change peak of ~140k BTC/month, increasing their balance by adding +306,358 BTC since the Nov 2021 ATH.
Live Workbench
The Entity-Adjusted Unspent Realized Price Distribution by wallet cohort examines the price points where this supply distribution was last transacted, and by which wallet cohort.
Around the $30k and $40k price buckets, we can see significant supply clusters associated with a diverse range of wallet cohorts, indicating these two price ranges experienced significant volumes of supply changing hands. However, there is little coin volume transacted between $27k and $20k, which may manifest as a region of high volatility, and potentially little support.
Live Chart in the Glassnode Engine Room
The Deterioration of Fundamentals
The
RVT Ratio
compares the Realized Capitalization against the daily volume settled On-Chain, this provides insight into the daily utilization of the network (On-Chain volume) relative to its intrinsic value (Realized Cap). A general framework for the interpretation of the RVT is:
High values and uptrends
indicate poor utilization and a slow-down in-network utilization.
Low values and downtrends
indicate high utilization and an uptick in-network utilization.
Stable sideways values
indicate that the current utilization trend is likely sustainable and in equilibrium.
The red band denotes an RVT ratio of 80 or above, suggesting the network valuation is now 80 times larger than the daily value settled. This is indicative of a barren on-chain activity landscape, which is historically a result of extended bearish price action, flushing cost-sensitive participants from the network.
In past bear cycles, an underutilized network has provided confluence with bear market bottoms. Should network utilization increase and RVT manages to break lower, it may signal improving fundamentals. However, with the RVT ratio currently at its highest value since 2010, a continued break higher would enter the somewhat uncharted bearish territory, where network valuation is even more 'overvalued' relative to network activity.
Live Workbench
The Entity Adjusted Dormancy Flow model can also be used to compare Market Valuation to network utilization from the perspective of the average coin age being spent in the network. Dormancy measures the average amount of Coin Days Destroyed on a per coin transacted basis. Dormancy Flow then compares the Market Capitalisation to Dormancy (in USD terms), thus capturing deviations in spending behaviour against the market valuation.
Dormancy Flow continues to trade at historical lows, suggesting that the market valuation is low relative to the time weighted on-chain transaction volume. Previous instances of Dormancy flow at these levels have typically coincided with bear market capitulation events and periods of maximum pain.
In line with the weakening Liveliness and HODLer performance, this aligns with a condition where even the oldest Bitcoin holders were purged from the network.
Live Chart
A Purging Of Even the Strongest Hands
Long Term Holders and Short Term Holders are dichotomous by nature and thus value different things.
Short Term Holders
are statistically more sensitive to price volatility, as their cost basis is much closer to the current spot price.
Long Term Holders
generally represent the HODLer cohort, whom are relatively price-insensitive. This cohort is more likely to weather volatility and price drawdowns in the pursuit of long term value (
covered in last weeks edition
).
The
Spent Price
is a model that represents the average cost basis of coins that were spent each day. This can be split to analyze the LTH and STH components to identify divergences between their spending behaviours. It is uncommon for the LTH cohort to spend coins with a higher average cost basis than their sister STH cohort, however this does occur when entering a deep capitulation zone, where even the strongest hands are purged from the asset.
The chart below compares the spent price of LTH to STH, and we can see that LTHs are currently spending coins with a higher cost basis than STHs. Previous instances of this have coincided with deep bear market finales, lasting between 52-days (2020) and 514-days (2014-15) and accompanied by additional drawdowns in the price of -40% to -65%.
Live Workbench
Comparing the aggregate market cost basis (Realized Price) to the LTH-Cost Basis shows that the two are currently converging. The LTH cohort usually has the lowest On-Chain cost basis, and this directly ties in with their trading ideology of buying low prices in value zones thus, their aggregate purchase is lower.
Therefore, with the LTH cost basis approaching the aggregate cost basis (from below), it is an indication that the current holdings of the 'smart money' cohort have not outcome the broader market. Previous instances where LTH Realized Price is higher than aggregate Realized Price also coincide with the deepest phases of a bear market.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market has entered a phase coincident with the deepest and darkest bear cycles of the past. Prices barely hold above the aggregate cost basis as captured by the Realized price, and on-chain volume fundamentals have deteriorated further. Historically, this phase has taken on the order of 8 to 24 months to pass by as the market hammers out a final bottom.
Of the highest note is that Long-Term holders are currently spending coins with a higher cost basis than Short-Term holders, and their cost basis is barely more profitable than the aggregate market. In the past, this has signalled the start of the final and painful wash-out phase of all remaining sellers, unfortunately, accompanied by a further 40% to 64% price decline.
All eyes are on the conviction and support provided by the Bitcoin HODLer class now.

on-chain DeFi markets
and off-chain as exchanges, lenders and
hedge funds
being rendered insolvent, illiquid or liquidated. The market sold off below 2017 $20k ATH on 18-June, reaching a truly remarkable low of $17,708. Prices did, however, recover the $20k level on Sunday.
With Bitcoin and digital assets being the only tradeable instruments over the weekend, macro fears and demand for dollar liquidity appear to have been taken out of the space. As a result of this extreme deleveraging event, we have started to see signals of capitulation across a number of entities, including miners, Long-term holders, and the aggregate market.
In this edition, we will explore these various sectors to assess whether maximum pain has been reached or not.

Rock Bottom Profitability
With the market trading below the $20k 2017 ATH, investor conviction and market profitability have been put to an extreme test.
The Realized Loss metric measures the total value delta between coins that were acquired at higher prices and the price when they were subsequently spent on-chain. Realized losses reached a new all-time-high, punctuated by three consecutive days with market-wide realized losses above $2.4B/day, totalling $7.325B. The profitability stress noted above appears to be playing out in investors actualizing the losses.
Live Chart
We can also investigate the profitability of specific investor cohorts relative to their realized price, which is the average price of all coins based on when they last moved on-chain. The chart below presents the MVRV Ratios for three Bitcoin cohorts (whole market, STHs and LTHs) which shows that all of them are now at a loss and holding coins below their cost basis on average.
Previous instances where all three cohorts are at an unrealized loss have coincided only with late stage bear market capitulations, providing confluence with the above profitability metrics.
Live Workbench
As we covered in
Week 23
, a powerful tool for tracking bear market extension is the diminishing profitability across supply and wallet-based metrics. What we are seeking are the thresholds of ultimate investor financial pain which exhausted sellers in previous cycles.
These maximum pain thresholds in supply can be investigated from different dimensions:
Supply in Profit üîµ
dropped to just 49.0% as the market traded down to $17.6k, putting more than half of the supply into an unrealized loss. Historical bear market floors have bottomed between 40% and 45% of supply in profit.
Addresses in Profit üü†
assesses the profitability among individual wallets and returns similar results to supply in profit. This metric is now just 10% higher than its lowest level in the 2018-2019 bear market and COVID crash, indicating just marginally less pain than at those bottoms.
UTXOs in Profit üü¢
enables us to gauge the market profitability based on all unspent outputs. This metric shows that 26.7% of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) are in loss. Historically at the bottom of the bear markets, 50.2% - 81.1% of all UTXOs were in loss.
LTH-Supply in Profit üî¥
monitors the profitability of long-term holders as a gauge of the severity of stress on Bitcoin's strongest-handed investors. At the moment, 35% of LTH-Supply is at a loss. This means this cohort is still shouldering less pain compared to past bear markets where LTHs held 42% to 51% of their supply in the loss.
There is an expected natural drift in the floor of these metrics as coins are lost and deep-HODLed over time. As such, the sell-off over the weekend can be considered to have plunged profitability and investors into a historically meaningful degree of financial pain.

Miner Capitulation Happening in Real-Time
A strong case can be made for Bitcoin to be considered a digital commodity, and like many commodities, it tends to have a relationship with its cost of production. By running a log-log regression model between Difficulty and Market Cap, we can estimate an all-in-sustaining cost for mined BTC.
This cost of the production model is currently trading at $17,600, which interestingly was the price low over the weekend.
Live Workbench
Our investigation in
Week On-Chain 23
uncovered the stress on miners' incomes due to falling revenues and rising production costs. Miner behaviours now confirm that an ongoing miner capitulation phase is underway. The first piece of evidence is the hash-ribbons, which have now inverted, as hashrate falls 10% off the ATH and signifies mining ASIC rigs are coming offline.
Live Chart
We can further validate that miner stress is in play using two tools:
The Puell Multiple
is an oscillator tracking miner USD denominated income and currently indicates that aggregate revenues are 65% lower than their yearly average. From declining miner revenues, we can imply that miner stress is likely.
The Difficulty Ribbon Compression (normalized)
then provides an explicit miner stress model, which like the hash-ribbons, monitors whether rigs are actually coming offline. Given we saw a recent uptrend in difficulty, we can also ascertain that the cost of production for BTC has increased.
Based on these two models, the ongoing miner income contraction is worse than the Great Migration in May-July 2021. However, miners have faced worse days in 2018-2019 and 2014-2015 bear markets, where the Puell Multiple reached 0.31 (69% revenue decline vs yearly average).
Live Workbench
To assess the probability of miner capitulation, we can combine these two metrics, seeking confluence between a Puell Multiple < 0.6 and Difficult Ribbon Compression < 0.06, distilled into the
Miner Capitulation Tool
(shown in yellow zones below).
Further bolstering this argument, we can also estimate the
Realized Price for Miners
(excluding the Patoshi coins) as a gauge for their mined balance cost basis, currently at $26,170.
Interestingly, on multiple occasions, the highlighted capitulation zones overlapped with the periods when the market price has been traded below the estimated
Realized Price for Miners
. Over the recent market crash to $17.6k, this overlapping structure is noticed for the first time since the COVID crash.
Live Workbench
With this extensive financial pressure on miners, outflow volumes from their treasuries reached rates of between 5k to 8k BTC per month. This is now comparable with the 2018-2019 bear market capitulation event. Remarkably, after Bitcoin failed to hold its ongoing consolidation‚Äôs low band ($28k), miners stopped spending and actually saw balances increase at a rate of 2.2k BTC per month.

The Great DeFi Deleveraging
Long-Term Holders: On The Verge Capitulation
The falling dominoes of the current bear market are advancing to a new phase. Alongside miners, Long-Term Holders are now beginning to feel the pressure, forcing many of them to sell at an accelerating rate. Long-Term Holder Supply has declined by 178k BTC over the last week, equivalent to 1.31% of their total holdings.
Live Chart
Revived supply 1yr+ confirms that spending by older coins it taking place, accelerating to rates of 20k to 36k BTC per day. This reflects an influx of fear and panic within even Bitcoins' stronger hand cohort.
Live Chart
We can map the motivating financial stress on Long-Term Holders using LTH-MVRV, a ratio between Market price and the LTH-Realized price. The recent market crash to $17.6k pushed this metric to 0.85, meaning LTHs, on average, are holding a 15% unrealized loss. This is a deeper low than was set during the COVID crash and just slightly above the 2018-2019 bear market capitulation bottom.
Live Chart
As Long-Term Holders, unrealized losses amplify, and the intensity of this selling-in-loss can be monitored by LTH-SOPR. This metric compares the market price with the cost basis of the LTHs spending coins each day.
Past capitulations of LTHs have occurred when this metric trades below 1, signifying that LTHs are taking losses after long holding periods. At bear market lows, this metric has previously fallen into the 0.4 to 0.6 range, indicating 40% to 60% losses.
Thus, the current spending behaviour by LTHs taking losses coincides with March 2020 but is not quite as severe as the 2015 or 2018 bear market lows.
Live Workbench
We can also track the net coin distribution of LTHs over a 30-day period to assess relative sell-side activity. Here we normalize values by total LTH supply to gain a comparative overview of these investors' behaviour across previous bear markets.
During the recent sharp drop, LTH investors have spent slightly more than 1% of their supply per month, a rate that coincident with the COVID crash and the post-ATH correction in December 2021. This level is almost two times higher than the 2018-2019 bear market maximum outflow.
Note that maximum LTH outflows are actually associated with bull markets (taking profits) rather than bear markets (experienced investors panicking and taking losses).
Live Workbench
Tracing Pain Into The Exchange
Exchanges remain the primary trading venue for Bitcoin and thus, characterizing the incoming coin flows can refine our observations of the market response to volatility and drawdowns. The following figure shows only instances where the weekly netflow to (red) or from (green) exchanges surpasses 1% of the Total Exchange Balances.
Reviewing the recent notable incidents:
The 2018-2019 bear market
saw a regime of weekly inflows > +1% of total exchange balance persist for over one month.
The LUNA crash
reached +4% of the total exchange balance in net inflows.
The current market
has this metric returning a -2.8% net outflow which is similar to the post-COVID crash outflows.
As such, despite heavy downside price action, exchange balances saw a net balance depletion at a rate of 2.8% of the total this week.
Live Workbench
Next, we can characterize the profitability of inflows to exchanges by the degree of profit and loss realized. Exchange Inflows over the last month have been dominated by realized losses, with the total magnitude surpassing 1.5% of the market cap.
This exceeds the May-July 2021 sell-off, however, is around half as severe as the extreme lows in the 2018-2019 bear market and COVID crash.
Live Chart in the Glassnode Engine Room
Summary and Conclusion
The Bitcoin market has now experienced two distinct capitulation phases since the ATH in November 2021. The first phase was triggered by the Luna Foundation Guard force selling its 80k+ BTC, and the second this week via a massive industry-wide deleveraging, both on and off-chain.
Miners are now under significant financial stress, with BTC trading near the estimated cost of production, incomes well below their yearly average, and hash-rate noticeably coming off ATHs. The aggregate market has realized over $7 Billion in losses this week, with Long-term Holders contributing some 178k BTC in additional sell-side.
As we have discussed in recent weeks (
23
and
24
), Bitcoin market participants across the board are at or very near historically high financial pain thresholds. With forced sellers appearing to drive much of the recent sell-side, the market might begin to eye whether signals of seller exhaustion are emerging over the coming weeks and months.

Prices did trade higher this week, coming off a low of $18,067, and rallying to a high of $21,783.
The digital assets market has recently experienced a widespread deleveraging event, which has driven many valuations to lows considered extreme, in both a historical and statistical context. We recently released two research pieces that provide detailed analysis into this de-leveraging event, covering both the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. These will provide additional context supporting this weeks newsletter:
The Great DeFi Deleveraging
covering the expulsion of over 60% of leverage accumulated in the Ethereum DeFi sector.
A Bear of Historic Proportions
where we explore the statistical deviation of Bitcoin and Ethereum from numerous long term means.
In this piece, we will provide an assessment of whether a Bitcoin bear market floor is likely to form within the current price range. We will draw on both on-chain, technical, and cyclical metrics. We will also gauge whether there is an observable loss of investor conviction, especially related to Long-Term Holders.
Note: This newsletter edition puts an extra focus on the application of Glassnode Advanced metrics, and has a more

Charting The Depths
Over the past decade, several models have been developed, from both technical and on-chain foundations, in an attempt to find the lows of Bitcoin bear markets. Here we will use the 2015, 2018 and March 2020 lows for comparison, and try to identify confluence between models.
There are five models shown on the chart below, listed in order of highest to lowest:
üî¥
Mayer Multiple of 0.6 ($23,380)
price trading at a 40% discount to the 200-day moving average, with just 3.4% of trading days closing at or below this level.
üü†
Realized Price ($22,500)
being the aggregate cost basis of the coin supply, typically provides resistance during bottom formation. 14% of all trading days have closed below.
üîµ
200 Week Moving Average ($22,390)
which has historically provided support during final bear market capitulation phase, and only 1% of days have closed below it.
üü¢
Balance Price ($17,980)
which accounts for the destruction of coin-days, and reflects a market price that matches the value paid for coins, minus the value ultimately realized. Just 3% of trading days have closed below this model.
üü£
Delta Price ($15,750)
which is the difference between the Realized Price, and the all-time-average price. This level never been breached on a closing basis, and has provided ultimate final support in bears.
In the current market, spot prices ($21,300) are trading below the Realized Price, the 0.6 Mayer Multiple band, and the 200 Week MA, and recently broke below Balanced Price during the 18-June flush out to $17,600.
Only 13 out of 4,360 trading days (0.2%) have ever seen similar circumstances
, occurring in just two prior events, Jan 2015 and March 2020. These points are marked in green on the chart below.
Live Advanced Workbench
The Accumulation Trend Score metric continues to return high values in excess of 0.9 throughout the month of June. This is being primarily driven Whale (>10k BTC) and Shrimp (< 1BTC) entities adding meaningfully to their on-chain balance.
In the last five years, there are six periods with similar stretches, which fall into three categories:
Bull Market Rallies
such as mid-2019 and the Q1-2021 Bull where influx of new demand pushes prices higher, often with early investors as the sell-side.
The Post Nov 2021 ATH
which can be best described as dip buyers who were unfortunately much too early.
Bear Market Bottoms
such as Nov 2018 and March 2020. These are periods where buy side demand finally overwhelms supply, and established a meaningful macro low.
Live Advanced Chart
Cyclical Lows
The Reserve Risk metric has also plunged to all-time-lows. This metric is heavily weighed down when there is an excess of HODLing behaviour, and coinday accumulation within the supply. This indicates that despite serious the downside price action of 2022, Bitcoin investors in aggregate remain generally steadfast in holding onto their coins (for better or worse).
Such deep lows on this metric are coincident only with the late 2015 bear, and the March 2020 flash crash events.
Live Advanced Chart
Similarly, Dormancy Flow has hit what is effectively an all-time-low (we are discounting pre-2011 early data). Where Reserve Risk captures the accumulation of coindays (HODLing behaviour), Dormancy Flow weighs the Market Cap against coinday destruction (HODLers spending).
What this metric is signalling that the Bitcoin Market cap is now very low relative to the value of coinday destruction. In other words, the asset is trading below implied fair value given the value that HODLers are liquidating. This is generally the case when the oldest coins that are being spent, are from the current cycle (i.e. old, but not ancient). We will revisit this idea later in this article.
A bearish interpretation here could be that we are seeing a period of historically low demand, that is simply incapable of absorbing the distributed supply by investors. The more constructive interpretation is that the market has over-extended to the downside, and is mis-priced relative to the conviction in the holder base.
Live Advanced Chart
The investor experience of HODLing Bitcoin for over 1yr is one of high volatility, and thus requires a sound thesis and strong conviction to avoid being shaken out.
With this in mind, the last cyclical oscillator in this sequence is the RHODL Ratio, which captures the relative wealth balance between 1y-2y old coins, and 1-week old coins.
With the RHODL Ratio approaching the macro range lows, this indicates that the coin supply is firmly and heavily dominated by these longer-term, more experienced investors. Conversely, there is a distinct lack of younger more inexperienced investors, which is synonymous with late stage bear markets, where the investor base is no longer saturated by new and inexperienced demand.
Live Advanced Chart
Thus we can see strong confluence between Reserve Risk, Dormancy Flow, and the RHODL ratio, which all suggest that the market remains dominated by strong thesis, high conviction investors.
The case for Bitcoin bottom formation is one grounded in observable dominance of strong hand investors, historically significant lows in numerous macro oscillators, and a strong confluence with prices hovering in striking distance of several bear market pricing models.
However, can these HODLers hold the line?
New Glassnode Research:
A Bear of Historic Proportions
As the Bitcoin and Etheruem prices plunge below the 2017-18 cycle highs, we quantify the magnitude of statistical deviation away from numerous 'fair value' means. What we find is that the 2021-22 bear market is arguably the most significant in digital asset history.
Read our latest research piece here.
A Bear of Historic Proportions
Hammering Out The Lows
There are a handful of metrics which are signalling that the market is in the process of hammering out a painful floor, likely best described as a capitulation and entry into a re-accumulation period.
The general trend of Active Addresses provides us with a reasonably good roadmap for progress through many phases of Bitcoin market structure. Bullish impulses are quite clear (green) whilst bear markets tend to oscillate sideways, or grind higher as the market recovers.
Active addresses have been largely constant at around ~800k per day and are range-bound within in the Bear Market Channel (red). As we have noted in prior editions, this supports the thesis that it is only the HODLers that remain. As such, 2022 has been a process of prices correcting towards the price floor their demand is sufficient to set.
Live Chart
Previous bear market floors have all bottomed out at a Percent Supply in Profit of around 40 to 45%. In other words, more than half of the coin supply was underwater. During the sell-off to $17.6k, the market did reach just below 50% supply in profit, triggering a significant capitulation and coin redistribution event (
covered last week
).
The net result of this redistribution is that a large volume of BTC has now changed hands below $20k. If we consider ~40-45% of supply in profit as an potential bear market floor threshold, how far must price now fall to plunge an additional ~5-10% of supply into loss?
Live Advanced Chart
In the URPD chart below, we can see that around 1.43M BTC changed hands between the recent $17.6k low, and the current price of $21.6k. This means that after the recent supply redistribution, and capitulation event, a retest of those lows would put an equivalent amount of supply into a loss as during previous bear market floors.
Live Professional Chart
The market structure of aSOPR also resembles a deep capitulation event, where the average spent coin was realizing a loss of -7%. The preceding early phase bear can be argued to include both mid-2021, and all of 2022 as shown in blue, which is similar to both 2018 and 2019 in structure.

Read our latest research piece here.
The Great DeFi Deleveraging
Have We Shaken HODLer Confidence?
Through the month of June, Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply declined by around 181.8k BTC, taking the total balance back to Sept 2021 levels. However, this equates to just 7.16% of the supply that was added between March and October 2021. Should this metric fall further, it would signal further sell-side pressure and a potential deterioration of LTH conviction. However a stalling and even recovery would work strongly against that notion.
Live Professional Chart
In this final section, we will attempt to assess whether the conviction of these Bitcoin HODLers has been shaken, given they are the final line of defence. We will do so by estimating the age of coins being spent against the following thesis:
If the LTHs who are spending are predominantly from the 2021-22 cycle
, it is more likely to be a classic capitulation, as investors holding underwater coins, through great volatility, finally throw in the towel.
If the LTHs who are spending are from the pre-2020 cycle
, it is more likely to reflect a widespread loss of conviction across some of Bitcoin's strongest, and longest believers.
We will further unpack which sub-set of LTHs are driving this 181.8k BTC in spending pressure by looking at increasingly senior age bands, to apportion an approximate weight to each cohort.
The chart below shows Supply older than 6-months. This supply has declined by 168.5k BTC in June. Given the LTH threshold is ~5-months, this means that an estimated 13.3k BTC spent were 5-6months old, representing around 7.3% of the total.
Live Advanced Workbench
For coins older than 1yr, this has declined from 65.72%, to 64.93% of circulating supply, equivalent to 150.7k BTC. Thus around 9.8% of LTH spending is attributed to 6m-12m old coins.
Continuing the logic, we can see that spending by coins older than 1yr accounts for around 82.9% of the BTC spent by LTHs, which is the lions share of spending during the June capitulation event.
Live Advanced Chart
However, if we consider the Supply last active 2yrs+ ago, we can see it has more or less stabilised around 44.5% of circulating supply since April 2022.
As such, we can deduce that of the 181.8k BTC spent by Long-Term Holders, approximately:
82.9% attributed to coins between 1yr and 2yrs old.
9.8% attributed to coins between 6m and 12m old.
7.3% attributed to coins between 5m and 6m old.
Thus our conclusion is that the recent LTH capitulation is almost entirely driven by 2020-22 cycle investors, and is most probably representative of a classic capitulation event, rather than a loss of conviction of very long-term Bitcoin investors.
Live Advanced Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Within the current macroeconomic framework, all models and historical precedents are likely to be put to the test. Based on the current positioning of Bitcoin prices relative to historical floor models, the market is already at an extremely improbable level, with only 0.2% of trading days being in similar circumstances.
Long-Term Holders have experienced a long-overdue, but seemingly classic capitulation in June, driven mostly by 2020-21 cycle investors. Almost all macro indicators for Bitcoin, ranging from technical, to on-chain are at all-time lows, coincident with bear market floor formation in previous cycles. Many are trading at levels with just single digit percentage points of prior history at similar levels. This aligns with the very large statistical deviations to the downside that we explored in our
recent analysis piece
.
With so many floor formation signals flashing, the question is, will this time be different?

Prices traded down -37.9% over the last 30-days, competing only with the 2011 bear market, for the crown of worst month on record. For a sense of scale, BTC prices were sub $10 in 2011.
Bitcoin prices consolidated this week, digesting the losses of the month, and maintaining a steady trading range around the 2017 $20k all-time-high. The market opened at a high at $21,471, traded down to brief mid-week low of $18,741, before rallying to close at $19,139.
With US
inflation estimates
for June remaining elevated, and storm clouds of a potential
recession looming
, the market remains heavily risk off. This is evident in the on-chain performance and activity of Bitcoin, which has reduced modestly in recent weeks. With network activity now at levels coincident with the deepest bear phase in 2018 and 2019, it appears that a near complete purge of market tourism has taken place.
The activity that does remain however appears to align with a steadfast trend of high conviction accumulation and self-custody. Exchange balances are draining at historically high levels, and Shrimp and Whale balances are increasing meaningfully.
With such complex and arguably divergence market forces, in this edition, we will attempt to identify the key trends that are emerging in on-chain performance and supply distribution for Bitcoin.

The End of Bitcoin Tourism
One of the most fundamental concepts in Bitcoin analysis is the assessment of on-chain activity. The idea is to identify relative strength, or weakness in the user-base, especially to identify changes in macro network character.
High Activity
is often synonymous with an influx of new demand, increased speculation, and is usually associated with bull markets (shown in green below).
Low Activity
is often synonymous with greatly reduced demand, and waning interest from market tourists, and is typical of bear markets (shown in red below).
As we will shortly explore, almost the entire suite of on-chain activity metrics indicate that the number and activity of network users are approaching the deepest historical bear market territory. The Bitcoin network is approaching a state where almost all speculative entities, and market tourists have been completely purged from the asset.
Address activity for example has declined by 13% from over 1M/day in November, to just 870k/day today. This suggests little growth in new users, and even a struggle to retain existing ones.
Live Chart
A more advanced version of this metric is the Number of Active Entities, which benefits from our clustering algorithms. These methods collate multiple addresses and assign them to on-chain entities, providing a more accurate and clear reflection of the more probable active user-base.
Active Entities did experience a notable rise post-Nov 2021 ATH as participants speculated on a further price leg up. However, this expectation has since dissipated, and has now established the prevailing downtrend. There are around 244k Active Entities per day, which is languishing around the lower end of the Low Activity channel typical of bear markets (shown in red).
A retention of HODLers is more evident in this metric, as Active Entities is generally trending sideways, indicative of a stable base-load of users.
Live Chart
Participant capitulation can be clearly observed through the collapse of Entities Net Growth, which shows the difference between new, and leaving entities on-chain. With exception of two major spikes during the
LUNA collapse
, and the sell-off in late June, overall growth rates are lacklustre to say the least.
Most recently, the user-base growth rate has plunged to around 7k net new entities per day, which is similar to lows seen during the worst bear market levels in 2018, and 2019.
Live Chart
The HODLer Baseload
The number of settled transactions sheds further insight into the demand for blockspace and network utilization on any given day. Assessing transaction counts is slightly more nuanced than Active Addresses/Entities for two reasons.
Limits on available blockspace create a limit on transactional capacity with fees being the release valve (which are very low, indicating almost no observable congestion).
The increasing efficiency of transactional technology such as batching, and SegWit, both of which saw large-scale upticks in adoption through 2020.
Extremely sharp decreases in transactions counts can be seen to punctuate the end of the bull markets in Jan 2018 and again in May 2021. After a few months of recovery, transactional demand can be seen to move sideways throughout the main body of the bear. This indicates both a stagnation of new entering demand, but also a probable retention of a base-load of users (the HODLers).
Live Chart
To reinforce this point, the number of addresses with a non-zero balance continues to grind higher, hitting a new ATH of 42.2M, and only minimally influenced by the recent capitulation drawdown.
The Bitcoin network often sees a significant purge of wallets during major sell-off events and in early bear markets, as investors capitulate and spend everything.
Jan to Mar 2018
saw a flush of -7M addresses which initiated the bear market, and was equivalent to 24.4% of the total. This remains the largest reduction on record.
Apr to May 2021
saw a collapse of -1M Non-Zero addresses amidst the Great Miner Migration, a reduction of 2.8% and quite a mild reaction compared to 2018.
May 2022
saw a removal of -430k addresses, a reduction of 1%, and significantly less severe than Apr-May 21 despite a larger price collapse.
Post-2018, the severity of Non-Zero address capitulation can be seen to diminish, indicating there is an increasing level of resolve amongst the average Bitcoin participant.
Live Chart
On-chain activity remains severely muted, and convincingly in the bear market territory. Almost all of the marginal buyers and sellers appear to have finally capitulated and purged from the network over the last 12-months. This leaves only a baseload of HODLers with the highest resolve remaining. There are few reinforcements coming into the Bitcoin demand side, and thus prices are correcting until these HODLers can set the floor.
Exchanging Divergences
Exchanges remain a centrepiece of Bitcoin market infrastructure, with hundreds of millions, to billions of dollars in Bitcoin value flowing through on-chain each day. The number of exchange deposits and withdrawals, tend to show a high degree of sensitivity and correlation with spot prices.
Generally speaking, both deposits and withdrawal counts trend alongside price, peaking around bull market tops, when the inflow of speculative demand is highest. Withdrawals (green) are often fewer in number relative to deposits (pink). This is due to exchanges processing multiple customer withdrawals in a single transaction, where as deposits are processed on an individual basis.
Over recent weeks, renewed attention has been placed on self-custody of blockchain assets, with a number of lending services halting user deposits and withdrawals. Perhaps in response to this unfortunate occurrence, we are currently seeing exchange withdrawals increasing, whilst deposit counts continue to decline.
This is historically unusual, with few similar examples in the last 5-years.
Live Chart
We can also assess the dominance of exchange related activity as a ratio of all transactions across the network. From this we can identify peaks and troughs in investor activity, and identify changes in base-load market structure.
Exchange transaction dominance reached an apex almost immediately after both bull market peaks in 2017 and again in 2021, capturing 80% to 94% of all activity. This marks the last gasp and influx of market tourism, as new participants buy the top, right before price plunges, and they are subsequently flushed from the network.
Exchange transaction dominance has undergone a lengthy detox since the May 2021 high, and appears to be stabilising at around 50%. This supports our earlier observations that the market is approaching a HODLer led regime.
Live Chart
Exchange reserves continue to see large scale net withdrawals, with aggregate balances declining to levels last seen since July 2018. Overall balance on Exchanges have seen an aggregate outflow of -750k BTC since March 2020. The last three months alone have seen some 142.5k BTC in outflows alone, a remarkable 18.8% of the total.
Exchange outflows at this scale, especially in the face of such extreme downside price action are intriguing, and we will further break-down these flows in the next sections.
Live Chart
We can observe changes in these reserves by individual exchange, where we see an interesting divergence is underway:
Coinbase
continues to see net outflows of coins, with an aggregate reduction of -450k BTC over the last two years. Coinbase balance has declined in a persistent 10k to 30k BTC step function. These coins are being transferred to new wallets which are not associated with the Coinbase entity. These may be custody solutions for institutions, given their holding size.
Binance
on the other hand has seen a net balance increase of roughly +300k BTC over the same time. As a result, Binance has now flipped Coinbase as the exchange with the largest Bitcoin supply as was highlighted by TXMC this week.
Friends, the real flippening is upon us. A new king is set to be crowned, and the name is Binance.
A withdrawal tithing of just 6214

will earn him the crown.

May 26, 2022
Alongside a historically bad month of price performance, exchanges have seen the largest monthly decline on record, hitting an outflow rate of -150k BTC/month. This accounts for a typical balance reduction of 5.0% to 6.0% of the total through June. This is in stark contrast with the flood of coins into exchanges that occurred in May-June 2021.
Live Chart
Where Did All The Coins Go?
The largest Exchange Net Position Change on record is complemented by the largest Illiquid Supply Change since June 2017. ¬†Illiquid supply has increased by 223k BTC in July, reflecting a large scale movement of coins towards wallets with little to no history of spending (generally speaking. these are not exchanges).
Again, this is in direct contrast to both May 2021, and during the LUNA collapse, which both saw a collapse in price reciprocated by a collapse in Illiquid Supply.
Live Chart
As Exchanges on aggregate continue to deplete, we can see aggressive accumulation taking place by both the largest (10k+ BTC) and smallest (<1 BTC) Bitcoin participants. Both Shrimps and Whales have seen near perfect scores (blue) on the Trend Accumulation Score metric since mid-May, indicating their on-chain balance has increased meaningfully, and consistently.
Cohorts holding 10 to 10k BTC are almost perfectly neutral, with no notable change to their aggregate holdings.
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room
Diving deeper into this, we can see that Shrimps are adding to their balance at a rate of 60.46k BTC per month, the most aggressive rate in history. This is equivalent to 0.32% of the circulating supply per month. Interestingly, the rate of Shrimp balance expansion surpasses the previous record set at the Dec 2017 ATH, when prices were also at $20k.
The Shrimp cohort clearly see $20k as an attractive price, albeit this time with the market trending in the other direction.
Live Chart
Finally, the chart below is derived from our Whale to/from Exchange Volume metrics, where a Whale is defined as an entity with > 1k BTC (excluding miners and exchanges).
On net, whales have withdrawn 8.69M BTC from exchanges we track, and their accumulation and distribution cycles appear to be well correlated with market price performance. Since April 2022, whale exchange volume have been predominantly withdrawals, reaching a significant rate of 140k BTC/month in June. This is the second highest rate in the last 5-years, surpassed only by the correction in Jan 2021.
Live Chart
Conclusions
Bitcoin on-chain activity is firmly in bear market territory, and the most recent network utilization suggests an almost complete purge of all market tourists has occurred. Demand for blockspace is low, and the growth of network users is lacklustre at best.
However, below the surface, the market is experiencing a number of very intriguing divergences. Despite a historically bad year-to-date, and now the worst month of price performance since 2011, strong HODLer undertones persist.
Exchange reserves continue to drain, as participants find renewed momentum towards self custody. These coins appear to be flowing into wallets with no history of spending, and the balance growth and exchange withdrawal activity of both Shrimp and Whale cohorts are at historically aggressive levels.
The Bitcoin bear is in full swing, and in its wake, the HODLers of last resort are the last ones standing.

Prices traded higher, opening at a weekly low of $18,971, and peaking at $22,230.
With the market now down over 75% from the all-time-high, even the strongest and longest term Bitcoin holders are feeling the pressure. Both Long-Term Holders and Miners are in the spotlight this week, as the market attempts to find a bottom amidst persistent macroeconomic uncertainty.
In this edition, we will seek to extract and identify key characteristics that have historically described the formation of Bitcoin bear market floors. This is a period of time where forced sales pass by, seller exhaustion is reached, and downside pressure begins to wane. We will explore this from a number of angles ranging from:
A final flush out of even the strongest hands, creating seller exhaustion.
The redistribution of wealth from low to high conviction holders.
A recovery of demand from both Big and Small entities.
A capitulation of the miner cohort which appears to be underway.

Wealth Redistribution
The prevailing bear market has numerous similarities to late-2018 in terms of market structure, which we can see in the Drawdown from the ATH metric. The following compares the current 2022 bear, with the 2018 bear market:
December 2017 - March 2019
: The fallout from the 2017 parabolic top extended for almost 15 months, culminating in a 85% drawdown from the ATH. The $6K area can be seen as the base level breakpoint before the ultimate capitulation, where an additional -50% was wiped from the market over the course of 1-month.
November 2021 - July 2022:
The current Bear Market has experienced a peak drawdown of 75%, with the $29K floor acting as a similar breakpoint base level. The latest capitulation in mid-June saw prices tumble -40% to $17.6k in just two weeks.
Live Chart
One of the main outcomes of a lengthy bear market is the redistribution of wealth among the stakeholders who remain. This progressive changing of hands can be analyzed by tracking the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD).
As highlighted in
Week On-Chain 23
, past bear markets, have had two distinct phases:
Post-ATH Phase:
Where the short-term investors and speculators (low conviction) gradually come to terms with the bear market reality and exit into a depreciating price trend. Moreover, some participants attempt counter-trading the macro trend leading to multiple temporary relief rallies (the dead cat bounce).
Bottom Discovery Phase:
Diminishing profitability and an extended period of financial pain results in declining new demand and creates favourable conditions for ultimate capitulation.
First, we will inspect the market from Dec 2017 to March 2019. Notice how price acts like a magnet, first attracting supply from top buyers towards the $6k region, and finally, an enormous redistribution occurs post capitulation into the $3k to $4k range. This describes a two part capitulation cycle, and eventual bottom formation
Live Chart
In the current 2022 market, we have a similar structure so far following the November 2021 ATH. We can see a similar redistribution pattern occurs around the $30k floor, originally established in May-July 2021. Over the course of May-June this year, we can see prices trade down to the $20k region which becomes a significant trigger point for both investor capitulation, and new buyers, thus being a node for coins changing hands.
Live Chart
Capitulation of Diamond Hands
With the loss of the $30k price level, miners and long-term holders (LTHs) have come under stress (as explored in
Week 25
). To demonstrate the ongoing capitulation of 2021-22 cycle LTHs, we can monitor their profitability on two fronts; their actualized losses (spending) and unrealized losses (coins held below cost basis).
Long-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR) is a metric which indicates the profit ratio captured by LTHs (i.e. a value of 2.0 means LTHs are spending coins at a price which is 2x their cost basis). Therefore, when LTH-SOPR is less than one, these players realize losses or spend coins at a price below their cost basis.
LTH-SOPR is currently trading at 0.67, indicating the average LTH spending their coins is locking in a 33% loss.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holder Cost Basis
estimates the average price long-term holders paid for their coins. Hence, as the market valuation falls below the LTH-Cost Basis, this cohort can be considered to be in aggregate loss. Similarly, LTHs are currently underwater on average, holding an aggregate unrealized loss of -14%.
Live Chart
The following chart combines these concepts and shows intervals which satisfy both conditions (in green). These moments are where LTHs are both underwater on held coins, and locking in losses based on their spending. In combination, this indicates there is an increased probability that a LTH capitulation is underway.
With the current value of LTH-SOPR at 0.67 and the LTH-Cost Basis at $22.3k, it means LTHs are realizing an average of -33% losses on each spent coin, despite spot prices only being ~6% below their cost basis. This signifies that LTHs who acquired coins at much higher are the primary spenders at the moment, and those who still hold coins from the 2017-20 cycle (or earlier) are largely sitting tight.
Live Workbench
The Transfer of Losses
A consequence of capitulation events is an immediate redistribution of coins to new buyers, whom are often classified as Short-Term Holders at first. Over time, however, the dominance of Long-Term Holders amongst the supply tends to increase, as fair-weather speculators are flushed from the market.
Bottom formation is often accompanied by LTHs shouldering an increasingly large proportion of the unrealized loss. In other words, for a bear market to reach an ultimate floor, the share of coins held at a loss should transfer primarily to those who are the least sensitive to price, and with the highest conviction.
This is the result of two mechanisms:
The exiting of entities with weak conviction (Short-Term Holders).
The gradual transfer of coins to entities with strong conviction, whom are relatively price-insensitive (Long-Term Holders)
In the depths of previous bear markets, the proportion of supply that was held by LTHs, and at a loss, reached above 34%. Meanwhile, the proportion held by STHs declined to just 3% to 4% of supply. At the moment, STHs still hold 16.2% of the supply in loss, suggesting that freshly redistributed coins must now go through the process of maturation in the hands of higher conviction holders.
This indicates that whilst many bottom formation signals are in place, the market still requires an element of duration and time pain to establish a resilient bottom. Bitcoin investors are not out of the woods yet.
Live Chart
The Recovery of Demand, Both Big and Small
A common component of previous bear market cycles is
the expulsion of Bitcoin tourists
. An observation made was the stand-out balance growth by Shrimps and Whales. Following on from this, we introduce a new indicator which seeks to track the relative on-chain activity of both small and large entities (originally coined by
CryptoVizArt
).
üßµ/1. Skewness, in statistics, is the degree of asymmetry observed in a probability distribution. Distributions can exhibit right (positive) skewness, left (negative) skewness, or no skewness (zero).
In the positive skewness case, the Mean > Median.

‚Äî CryptoVizArt.btc üìà (@CryptoVizArt)
February 22, 2022
Considering the historical transactional data for Bitcoin, the mean value of daily transfer volume has typically been larger than the median value. This is largely the result of there being a larger quantity of small value transactions and a smaller quantity of large value transactions.
We can see this in the consistent disparity between the Mean üî¥ and Median üîµ transaction USD size throughout Bitcoin history. Therefore, the Bitcoin on-chain transaction value distribution displays positive
skewness
.
Skewness
is the degree of asymmetry observed in a distribution. Positive skewness occurs when the Mean is greater than the Median. This indicates that there are a greater number of small value transactions than large ones.
Live Workbench
We can use this observation to develop a macro framework to assess the comparative level of activity, and demand from small, and large size entities. The oscillators below are constructed by taking the ratio between the 7DMA and the 365DMA of the median (small entities üîµ), and mean (large entities üî¥) USD-transaction volumes.
When Small Entities
üîµ
exceed Large Entities
üî¥, it typically suggests an influx of small size transactions and is often associated with the excitement of bull markets and greater speculation.
When the indicators are increasing
, it can be considered to be a signal of higher demand from that entity cohort.
When the indicators are decreasing
, it can be considered to be a signal of lower demand from that entity cohort.
What can be seen in the current market cycle is that the red curve has consistently traded above the blue curve. This indicates that the activity of large entities (likely institutions) has been dramatically higher than retail, both through the bull cycle and more recently during the capitulation events.
Furthermore, we can see that smaller entities remain quite active relative to past bears, but we have not yet seen a bottoming and recovery reversal yet. This is a characteristic to keep an eye on to watch for expanding demand from both entity cohorts. The key takeaway from this metric is that whilst activity is in bottom formation territory, like the conclusion above, it has not yet reverted into recovery mode just yet.
Live Workbench
Miner Capitulation
Finally, we will turn attention to the miner cohort, who often tend to become an influential source of selling pressure during late-stage bear markets. This is a result of the cyclical nature of their income, and current bear market has been no exception to this trend.
To track whether a
Miner Capitulation
is in play, we can consult a two-part model, which seeks confluence between implied income stress (Puell Multiple) and observed hashrate decline (Difficulty Ribbon Compression).
The Puell Multiple
üü† tracks aggregate miner income in USD, relative to the 1-year average. Here, we can see that presently Bitcoin miners are earning just 49% as much as the 12-month average. This implies miner income stress is a likely factor.
The Difficulty Ribbon Compression
üü£ signals that hashrate is indeed coming offline, causing protocol difficulty to fall in a statistically significant way. This is an explicit observation that ASIC rigs are being switched off due to income stress.
Miner Capitulation Risk
üü° highlights periods where both metrics signalled meaningful lows and generally correlated with extreme bear market lows and an elevated risk of miner capitulation events.
Live Workbench
With confirmation that miner capitulation risk is a factor, we can confirm that aggregate miner balances have experienced up to 4.47k BTC/month in distribution. This started primarily after the collapse of the LUNA-UST project.
The income stress on these miners has resulted in a total distribution of 7.9k BTC from their treasuries over a two month period. That said, miners have slowed their spending of late and are currently distributing from their stored treasuries at a rate of 1.35k BTC/month.
The duration of miner capitulation in the 2018-2019 bear market was around 4-months, with the current cycle only having started in 1-month ago. Miners currently hold approximately 66.9k BTC in aggregate in their treasuries, and thus the next quarter is likely to remain at risk of further distribution unless coin prices recover meaningfully.
Live Workbench
Conclusion
The present market structure has many hallmarks of the later stage of a bear market, where the highest conviction cohorts, the long-term holders and the miners, are under remarkable pressure to surrender.
The volume of supply at a loss has now reached 44.7%, of which a majority is carried by the Long-Term Holder cohort. However, this remains at a less severe level compared to previous bear cycles. We also introduced a new indicator that tracks the activity level of small and large entities, as a tool to map market recovery. This supports the observation that the market is well into the bear, however has not yet formed a confident bottom, and still has work to do.
Overall, the fingerprint of a widespread capitulation, and extreme financial stress is certainly in place. However, there may still be a combination of both time pain (duration), and perhaps further downside risk to fully test investor resolve, and enable the market to establish a resilient bottom.

This follows a volatile response across markets early in the week, as US headline CPI inflation hit a forty-year high of 9.1%. There is also a challenging backdrop of growing civil unrest, rising energy prices, and resource scarcity in many nations around the world.
Within this context, the Bitcoin and wider digital assets market have already experienced one of the heaviest, and fastest downwards repricing events in their history. This process has cleared a great deal of excess leverage from the system, and has driven Bitcoin prices below the Realized Price (the estimated cost basis of BTC holders).
In this edition, we will study the current Bitcoin market structure, through the lens of both unrealized (held coins), and realized (spent coins) losses by various investor cohorts. The target of this study is to gauge whether a similar degree of seller exhaustion is in play compared to previous bear market cycle lows. These tools can help structure a case, and probabilities for a bear market bottom forming around $20k.

Life Under the Sea
To start this piece, we will first define what is meant by
Realized Value
and
Unrealized Value
, as these concepts will be foundational to the insights that follow.
Realized Value (spent coins)
is the difference between the value of a coin at the time of disposal, and at the time of acquisition on-chain. For example, an investor buys 0.5 BTC at $40k, and then and withdraws it from an exchange. The investor then redeposits it for sale at $20k. Here, they have 0.5 * ($20k - $40k) = -$10k in
realized losses
.
Unrealized Value (unspent coins)
is the difference between the current value of a coin, and the value at the time of acquisition on-chain. In the example above, if the investor still holds 0.5 BTC, and the price is trading at $21k, they would hold an
unrealized loss
of 0.5 * ($21k - $40k) = -$9.5k.
The Realized Price is one of, if not the most widely recognized Bitcoin on-chain models, and is often considered to be the on-chain acquisition price (cost basis) of the Bitcoin supply. It is currently trading at $22,092, vs current spot price of $21,060, which puts the average Bitcoin investor at an unrealized loss of -4.67%.
The chart below shows how previous bear cycles have all bottomed and established an accumulation range bellow the Realized Price. Time spent below the Realized Price ranges from 7-days in March 2020, to 301-days in 2015.
If we exclude March 2020 (a flash event), the average time spent below the Realized Price is 197-days, compared to the current market with just 35-days on the clock.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can visualize the aggregate Unrealized Profit/Loss within the Bitcoin network by taking the ratio between market price, and the realized price, yielding the MVRV ratio.
High MVRV Ratios (> 1.0
üü†
)
signify a larger degree of unrealized profit is held within the system. Historically values exceeding 3.0 have signalled overheated bull markets.
Declining MVRV Ratios (
üîµ
)
signify reducing profitability in the system. This is the result of both falling prices (lower MV), and also coin redistribution, as investors take profits and sell coins acquired at cheaper prices, to new buyers at higher prices (higher RV). A large bearish divergence can be seen between the Apr and Nov 2021 ATHs as a result of this mechanism (shown in blue).
Low MVRV Ratios (< 1.0,
üî¥
)
signify the market price is below the average investors on-chain acquisition price. This is typical of late-stage bear markets, and is often associated with bottom formation, and accumulation.
The MVRV Ratio is currently trading at 0.953 (-4.67% unrealized loss), which is not as deep as the average of 0.85 (-15% unrealized loss) seen in previous bear cycles. This may mean further downside and/or consolidation time is required to establish a bottom. However, it may also signal that a greater degree of investor support exists in this bear cycle.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
MVRV
breaking above 1.0 would signal a Price is breaking above Realized Price, suggesting potential market strength.
Live Advanced Workbench
In addition to the Realized Price, we have a number of supporting on-chain pricing models which tend to attract spot prices during late stage bears.
Delta Price ($14,215,
üü§
)
is a form of 'half fundamental, half technical' hybrid pricing model. It is calculated as the difference between the Realized Price, and the all-time Average Price. Delta price has previously caught the bottom wicks of bear markets.
Balanced Price ($17,554,
üî¥
)
takes the difference between Realized Price, and Transferred Price (
coinday time weighted price
). This can be thought of as a form of 'fair value' model, capturing the difference between what was paid (realized, cost-basis), and what was spent (transferred).
Both the 2015 and 2018 bear market lows were set with a short-term wick down to the Delta Price (green zone). However, both accumulation ranges spent most of the bottom formation process trading between the Balanced Price (range low) and the Realized Price (range high) as shown in blue.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Price
breaking below $17,545 would signal a break below Balanced Price, and potential market weakness.

Coins Change Hands: Unrealized Loss
Market bottom formation often has a signature of large positive swings in unrealized profit and loss. This is a result of capitulation and coin redistribution to new buyers, who are now less sensitive to price fluctuations.
Thus, we can start by isolating only those coins which hold an unrealized loss (2021-22 cycle buyers), to calculate their aggregate USD value. With the market trading between $17.6k and $21.8k, the aggregate Unrealized Loss has ranged between -$165B and -$198B.
Note how the total unrealized loss in the post-Nov ATH era was much larger in comparison to the May to July 2021 period, even when prices were at $29k (shown in üîµ). This is a result of coin redistribution during and after the Aug-Nov rally, and is the same mechanism that created the bearish MVRV divergence.
This generally confirms that the Aug-Nov rally was more akin to a 'bear market relief' rally, than a resumption of the bull market.
Live Advanced Workbench
The chart below shows this total unrealized loss, as a proportion of the current market cap, to normalize for size. Here, we can see that the total unrealized losses are equivalent to around 55% of the market cap, which is larger than in March 2020, and not dissimilar in magnitude to the 2018 bear market lows.
The gradual downtrend of this metric (shown in üü¢) during largely sideways, accumulation style price action, is indicative of improving holder profitability:
Coins are sold during capitulation events, and bought by lower time preference buyers.
Losses transition from unrealized to realized
Coins are thus re-valued to a new and lower cost-basis, with a new owner.
As prices start to rise, these newly acquired coins switch from holding an unrealized loss, to an unrealized profit, usually starting the bullish cycle again.
Live Advanced Chart
Inspecting the total BTC supply in profit can bolster this argument. When prices fell to $17.6k, a total volume of 9.216M BTC were holding an unrealized loss. However, after the 18-June capitulation, one month of consolidation, and a price rally to $21.2k, this volume has declined to 7.680M BTC.
What this suggests is that 1.539M BTC were last transacted (have a cost-basis) between $17.6k and $21.2k. This indicates that around 8% of the circulating supply has changed hands in this price range.
Live Advanced Chart
We can also inspect the coins holding an unrealized profit, this time through the lens of Long- and Short-Term Holders. We can see that all previous bear market lows reach a point where there are effectively no Short-Term Holders in profit, as the market dives well below their acquisition price.
For a strong market recovery, analysts can monitor whether the volume of STHs in profit swells rapidly should prices rally out of the consolidation range. An event like this has followed every major bear market floor (green), as investors who capitulated, transferred their coins to new buyers, with a lower, and thus less price sensitive cost basis.
Live Professional Chart
Deep Capitulation: Realized Losses
In order for a market floor to be established, Bitcoin investors typically need to experience a wide-ranging capitulation event. This acts to flush out all remaining marginal, and forced sellers, effectively creating seller exhaustion.
May and June 2022 have seen two such events, both during the LUNA collapse, and when prices plunged below the 2017 cycle ATH on 18-June. On a 30-day sub basis, these events triggered total realized losses of $27.77B, and $35.5B over a 30-day window, respectively. As shown, these eclipse anything seen historically on a USD basis.
Live Advanced Workbench
The same can be said about BTC denominated losses, which are so large, that we have to look back to 2011, when BTC was trading below $3, to find an equivalent. A simply staggering volume of BTC locked in a realized loss between May and July, with 538k BTC spent during the LUNA collapse, and another 480k BTC spent on 18-June.
Live Professional Chart
The structure of the aSOPR metric also displays many similarities to bear market capitulation events. As profitability declines (blue), investors start to lock in increasingly large losses, until a final waterfall moment of capitulation (red) takes place. The market eventually reaches seller exhaustion, prices start to recover, and investor pain starts to subside (üü¢).
A recovery of aSOPR back towards (and ideally above 1.0) would help bolster the observations above, that complete capitulation has taken place, accumulation is underway, and the market is recovering well.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
aSOPR on 14-day SMA
breaking above 1.0 signals a return to profitable spending, and a potential market recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
The proportion of transfer volume in profit is also has market structure similar to previous bear market lows. During the 2015 and 2018 capitulation phases, over 58% of transfer volume was realizing a loss, and momentum had compressed after months of bearish price action.
As the market started to bottom, a greater proportion of coin volume had a lower cost basis, and spending was no longer heavily dominated by panic sales, and/or forced sellers.
At the moment, 54% of the transfer volume is in loss (46% in profit), which is very close to 2015/18 recovery levels. Similar to aSOPR, upwards recovery of this metric would provide signal that seller exhaustion may have been reached, and recovery could be underway.
üîî

:
Percent Transfer Volume in Profit on a 90-day EMA
breaking above 48% would signal a recovery of profitability, and potential market strength.

Impacts on Supply Dynamics
To close out this piece, we will inspect the Realized Cap HODL waves, which map out the distribution of the USD wealth stored in Bitcoin, by various age bands. We have split this into two cohorts; Coins aged 3-months or less (Hot Money), and Coins aged 3-months or more (HODLer Money).
The total USD value held in the 'Hot Money' is in a structural downtrend, and has now fallen below 20%. This describes two phenomena:
Older coins have largely slowed their spending, else these younger age bands would be swelling (as is the case in bull markets, as long-term investors take profits). This is a signal of high HODLer conviction.
Long-term investors are gradually accumulating 'Hot Coins' and taking them off-market, allowing them to age and mature in cold storage (
as seen in WOC 27 with historically large exchange withdrawals
).
Live Advanced Chart
Finally, inspecting the older cohort of coins, we can see the mirror image, where over 80% of the USD wealth is now older than 3-months (acquired before LUNA collapsed). This trend continues to increase, driven strongly by the 6m-1y and 1y-2y brackets. This is despite a great majority of the capitulation and forced sellers being from these 6m-2y cohorts (as we explored in
Week 26
).
Again, this has numerous hallmarks of the Bitcoin market approaching seller exhaustion.
Live Advanced Chart
Conclusions and Summary
The Bitcoin market has corrected hard, and fast in 2022, driven by the unwind of excess leverage, and a plethora of forced sellers and liquidations. In a relatively short 7-month period, BTC has traded from an ATH, all the way into what resembles a bear market bottom.
In the piece above, we explored the current markets structure through the lens of Unrealized and Realized Losses, seeking signals of seller exhaustion. A common thread amongst almost all metrics explored above, is a trend resembling the majority of bear market lows in the past, albeit lacking a component of duration.
Against a backdrop of extremely challenging macroeconomic, and geopolitical turmoil, Bitcoin is reaching peak investor saturation by high conviction HODLers, and it is becoming quite plausible that a genuine bottom formation could be underway.

Price action opened at $20,781, rallied into a peak of $24.179, before pulling back towards the highs of the consolidation range over the weekend.
In this edition, we will assess the sustainability of the current market rally through the following concepts:
Assess price zones of interest from supply concentrations, technical, and on-chain pricing models.
Evaluate the market reaction to many metrics reaching statistically significant over-correction.
Gauge the strength of the upwards move by assessing confluence through momentum oscillators (MRGO and moving averages).

HODLer Supply Concentrations
With the market valuation of Bitcoin falling over 75% in 2022, speculators have been largely expelled from the network (
as discussed in WoC 27
). During this process, a redistribution of coins from lower conviction to strong conviction holders takes place. This is a mechanism native to any market cycle where assets are transferred to more cost insensitive HODLers who invest with longer time frames, and allow their coins to mature in cold storage.
We can observe this phenomena via the Unspent Realized Price Distribution (URPD), separated by the Short Term and Long Term Holder cohorts. Note, that the Short-to-Long-Term Holder threshold (155-days) is back in mid-Feb when prices were trading around $40k.
The $20K region has attracted a large cluster of Short-Term Holder coin volume
. This is a result of a significant transfer of ownership from capitulating sellers, to new and more optimistic buyers.
Short Term Holder demand nodes can also be seen at the psychological price levels of $40K, $30K and $20K
. Notably, much of this supply (incl. the LTH supply above) has not capitulated, despite prices trading more than 50% below their acquisition level. This is likely indicative of ownership by relatively price insensitive buyers.
It would be constructive to see these STH held coins at the $40k-$50K level start to mature to LTH status over coming weeks, helping to bolster this argument.
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine
Looking at the URPD by cohort age, we can observe the distribution of the Bitcoin Supply by time since the coins were last transacted. There are two fundamental points to takeaway:
Elevated demand can similarly be noted around the $20K
region with a vast amount of recent transaction occurring in this zone. This area also contains the 2nd and 4th largest URPD nodes (around 900K BTC) further indicating there was a large transfer of ownership within this zone.
Maturity can be seen to decline from the ATH to current market value, reflective of the duration of the prevailing downtrend.
Large volumes of coins accumulated over 6-months ago, which are holding heavy unrealized losses appear unwilling to sell
.
Both URPD formats present a case that an increasingly large proportion of the supply is held by HODLers who are allowing coins to mature despite holding losses. Their demand inflows have centred around the psychological $20k, $30k and $40k consolidation zones.
However, it is important to note that during this process, many long-term holders have contributed to the sell-side, and the URPD charts essentially represent the ‚Äòpost-dust settling‚Äô condition to date. Furthermore, it is possible that these high supply concentration nodes, may act as firm resistance when the market attempts to recover higher.
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room
Rebounding Off An Over-extension
Prices have responded positively this week, breaking above the recent consolidation zone. This comes off the back of what may be considered a significant short-term over-correction, with many metrics reaching extreme statistical deviations.
This was driven heavily by a period of rapid deleveraging across the market, with many lenders, investors, and trading firms seeing collateral liquidated, either by discretion, or as forced sellers as seen in
WoC25: Falling Dominoes: Capitulation Across the Board
and
WoC23: Miner Incomes Under Stress.
The Mayer Multiple
can be used to assess deviations between spot prices and the 200DMA. The 200DMA is widely used within traditional technical analysis as a tool to distinguish between between macro bull and bear trends.
At the most extreme during this price correction, the Mayer Multiple had reached below 0.55, signalling the market was trading at a 45% discount to the 200DMA. Such events are extremely uncommon, and only account for 127 closes out 4186 days, a total of 3% of the trading history.
Live Advanced Workbench
The MVRV Metric is another powerful tool to assess these deviations between spot pricing, and the aggregate market cost basis. With BTC prices breaking above the Realized Price this week pushing the wider market back into aggregate profit, short term outlook has shifted upwards with participants eager for any form of relief rally.
Bitcoin as an asset is constantly maturing, in recent years it has garnered interest on both institutional and national levels. Therefore, to account for dynamic economical climates, a 4 Year Rolling Z-Score is used to normalize the data whilst also capturing the common halving cycle.
Standard Deviations below -1 have a strong history of helping to identify bottom formation
. Thus far, it has signaled undervaluation for all bear cycle bottoms, including 2015, 2018, and the March 2020 flash crash.
The June leg down in price action has produced the lowest 4-yr rolling Z-Score value on record
, suggesting a statistically extreme deviation was reached, adding fuel to the present upwards relief rally.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can now introduce the concept of Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which we use as a gauge for periods where relatively old, or young coins are dominating the spending behavior. For each day a coin remains unspent, it accumulates one coin-day, equal to its BTC volume. When that coin is spent, it is considered to destroy that accumulated time, producing the CDD model. This tool effectively captures the time-weighted economic value of coins that are on the move each day.
Here we compare whether the Monthly average CDD value is higher, or lower than the Yearly average.
Blue Zones
in the chart below show periods where recent expenditure of older coins is exceeding the yearly average. This is typical of bull markets (profit taking) but also capitulation events in bear markets (panic selling, capital preservation).
From this, we can deduce that longer-term investors with older coins have accelerated their spending of more mature UTXOs as prices traded down into the lows.
Lice Advanced Workbench
The MVRV Z-Score (blue) can then be used in combination with the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) oscillator (orange). This produces a model which observes both both aggregate profitability (MVRV) and the coin age demographics dominating actualized spending behavior (CDD).
Elevated CDD oscillator values above 1
whilst the market is in aggregate loss (
MVRV below 1
) generally coincides with capitulation periods.
Elevated CDD oscillator values above 1
whilst the market is in aggregate profit (
MVRV above 1
) usually coincides with topping structures.
What this model signals is when longer-term investors are both spending a larger proportion of coins, at the same time as the market is on aggregate under-water on their position. What we can see is that longer-term investors have likely experienced an appreciable degree of capitulation between May and July.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can now formalize this observation by inspecting the actual spending behavior of Long-Term Holders. Long Term Holders (LTH) are often considered synonymous with the HODLer class and represent participants of
statistically higher conviction
. In the chart below, we compare the profitability of their more recent monthly spending, to their yearly average.
When monthly profitability exceeds yearly profitability (orange)
, the market is entering overheated conditions, as LTHs are spending more, and taking increasingly large profits.
When monthly profitability is less than yearly profitability (red)
, it generally suggests extended Bear Market momentum is in effect, and losses are being locked in by the LTH cohort.
Live Professional Workbench
In the current market, Long Term Holders have seen their recent profitability drift significantly below their yearly performance, for almost 400 consecutive days. The decline has reached similar duration and depth to the 2018 bear market lows, and provides added weight to the arguments made above.
With such severe statistical deviations from the mean punctuated with unprecedented forced selling from crypto-native institutions across the board, a wave of relief was of high probability. In the next section we will assess the conditions required for continuation of the current upwards momentum as well as the conditions that would lead to rejection.
Resistance to Recovery
With price action now experiencing its first relief rally since April, we can assess various models which have provided overhead resistance in previous bear cycles. We can compare resistance levels between both a macro technical view point, and then seek confluence with a suite of on-chain models.
The following simple moving averages have displayed relevance for Bitcoin price action through time:
The 200WMA
is currently at $22K and has historically been an indicator for bottoming formation.
The 111DMA
is a component of the Pi Cycle Top indicator, and currently resides at $30K, aligning with a psychological price level, and with supply concentrations detailed above.
The 200DMA
is trading at $35K, and remains a key transitional boundary between macro bull and bear market momentum.
Live Advanced Workbench
Next, the on-chain cost basis of Short Term Holders, Long Term Holders, and finally the aggregate market Cost Basis can be used to assess relative price action strength. We can also consider the Realized Price to Liveliness Ratio (RPLR), which aims to describe a sort of HODLer implied fair value.
Price has recorded a breakout above both the Realized Price, and the LTH Realized Price, which are each trading at $22K. The channel between the two is a contested point of interest providing confluence with the 200 WMA.
The Short Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis is currently trading at $28.5K and is in a strong downtrend. This is a product of two mechanisms, STHs realized losses, lowering their average cost basis, and the transfer of coin wealth to a new cohort of STHs buying closer (or below) the current spot price.
The RPLR is trading at $35.8k, which provides confluence with the 200DMA. Given the wide view on the 200DMA, and the implied value imparted by HODLers in the RPLR, these models make for a structural level worth keeping an eye on.
Live Professional Workbench
An interesting interaction to observe is when the cost basis for LTH cohort trades back above the aggregate cost basis for the wider market (the Realized Price). For the LTH RP to increase, LTHs must either buy coins above their own cost basis, or coins with a higher cost basis must mature past the 155-day threshold. In a bear market, this is often a high bar, and rarely happens.
Instead, the Realized Price generally climbs as a result of profits being realized. As the market bottoms, strengthens, and sufficient demand flows in to absorb profit taking, the Realized Price can climb, above the LTH Realized Price.
The duration of previous bear market low divergences has ranged between 248-days and 575-days. In the current cycle, it has only been in effect for 17 days, a comparatively short duration.
Live Professional Workbench
Confluence in Momentum
The Market Realized Gradient Oscillator is a statistically normalized oscillator, designed to measure the relative change in momentum between speculative value, and true organic capital inflows. It does this by comparing the rate of change between the Market Price, and the Realized Price.
Positive Values
indicate constructive upwards momentum over the considered period.
Negative Values
indicate bearish momentum over the considered period.
Breaks above or below 1
indicate a changing momentum to the upside or downside, respectively.
Here, we assess for confluence between the 14, 28 and 140 days variants of the oscillator to identify connection across multiple timeframes.
Starting with the 14day MRGO, a positive breakout can be seen producing structural higher highs indicating increasing momentum. The 14 day oscillator is particularly sensitive due to its bi-weekly period and is thus a more responsive, but noisier variant.
Further continuation of this pattern to the upside would signify short term relief is a probability.
Rejection from positive regions would indicate a deterioration in short term momentum.
Live Advanced Workbench
The 28day MRGO is similarly producing higher highs suggesting that downside momentum is slowing over the longer term. It is currently signalling modest upside momentum is in effect. However, as seen immediately prior to the June sell off, the previous attempt at upside momentum failed to achieve escape velocity and was followed by a violent collapse in price.
Thus, the market momentum relative to measurable capital inflows is at a cross-roads in the short-term.
Live Advanced Workbench
The 140day MRGO is a much longer time frame momentum oscillator. Unlike the previously discussed variants, the 140day is less sensitive to short term price volatility and thus represents a proxy for long duration momentum, and macro trends.
The 140day MRGO has seen persistently lower peaks since March 2021 and has not recorded a positive value in 2022. This highlights a macro bearish market dynamic has likely been in effect for the last 15 months.
The current extended negative value regime is indicative of the persistently negative price performance in 2022, and remains in the favor of the bears at this stage.
The underlying trend continues to slowly grind higher indicating a potential longer term recovery is in effect, however suggests additional duration and recovery time may be required.
Though the lens of the 140 day MRGO, the sell-off back in May 2021 remains the most severe momentum shift in this cycle. However, as discussed in
A Bear of Historic Proportions
, the recent sell-offs in May (LUNA) and June 2022 can be considered some of the largest on record. This indicates on a macro scale, the degree of downside market momentum is diminishing over time, potentially signalling a degree of seller exhaustion, and stabilization is on the horizon.
Live Advanced Workbench
Conclusions and Summary:
With so little price relief year to date, profitability has been poor for all investor classes. The Long Term Holder cohort is no exception, and their spending patterns suggest a non-trivial flush out has occurred between May-June 2022.
However, long-term supply dynamics continue to improve, as redistribution takes place, gradually moving coins towards the HODLers. Notable supply concentrations are observable at $20K, $30K and $40K, which tend to align with both technical, and on-chain price models, making these regions significant zones of interest.
Momentum in the short-term suggests continuation of the upswing, provided the Realized Price and Long Term Holder Realized Price can hold as a support level. On the long-term, momentum suggests the worst of the capitulation could be over, however a longer recovery time may be required as foundational repair continues.

Broader markets responded positively to the FOMC announcement as Chairman Powell indicated that the current target Fed Funds rate at 2.25% to 2.5% was now considered neutral, and eyes were on developing data on economic slow-down.
In many regards, recent positive price action for Bitcoin and Ethereum gives much awaited relief to the bulls, who have weathered almost nine months of persistent downtrend. The 2022 bear market has been historically negative for the digital asset space. However, after such a sustained period of risk-off sentiment, attention turns to whether it is a bear market relief rally, or the start of a sustained bullish impulse.
In this edition, we will explore this concept utilising on-chain activity as a baseline, and whether the market is signalling an influx of new demand, or if it lacks sustained follow through.

Bitcoin Activity Grinds Sideways
Generally speaking, an influx of new demand into blockchain networks is supported and signalled by sustained upticks in usage on-chain. We can use both on-chain activity, and supply dynamics to assess performance relative to recent comparable history as a guide.
Bullish Impulses
tend to be described by rising and elevated on-chain activity as more users enter the network. Generally this is supported by increasing volumes of supply changing hands at a profit as older investors sell, and new demand absorbs these coins.
Bearish Impulses
tend to see declining on-chain activity, often in a violent and rapid flush out. Bear markets then take time to recover as supply rotates from speculators, back to long-term and high conviction holders.
Bitcoin active addresses remain firmly within a well defined downtrend channel üî¥. Note also how the Oct-Nov ATH üîµ reached significantly lower peak than the April 2021 ATH, suggesting a major washout of users had occurred, and demand did not follow-through.
With exception of a few activity spikes higher during major capitulation events, the
current network activity suggests that there remains little influx of new demand as yet
.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Active Addresses (14 SMA)
breaking above 950k would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
The demand for on-chain transactions and blockspace tells a similar story. The market structure of the last year is quite similar to the 2018-19 period (shown in üîµ).
After the initial wash-out in and demand destruction May 2021 üî¥, transactional demand has traded sideways to slightly lower, indicative that
only the stable base of higher conviction traders and investors remain
.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Transaction Rate (14 SMA)
breaking above 3.0 would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
As a result of lacklustre transaction demand, on-chain transaction fees are firmly within bear market territory üîµ, seeing only 13.4 BTC in total fees paid per day. Similar to active addresses, and transaction demand, the demand destruction üî¥ is visible in May 2021, as network congestion collapsed, and fees started forming a bear market baseline.
Bull markets typically maintain elevated fee rates üü¢, and often are one of the first signals of demand recovery.
Whilst we have not seen a notable uptick in fees yet, keeping an eye on this metric is likely to be a signal of recovery
.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Transaction Fees (14 SMA)
breaking above 35 BTC/day would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
We can confirm these observations by looking at the average data footprint (in bytes) of Bitcoin blocks:
Network congestion and full blocks
üî¥ will result in larger block sizes as miners fill blocks as tightly as possible to earn maximum fee revenue.
Low network congestion and partially empty blocks
üîµ will result in smaller blocks as there are insufficient transactions for miners to fill all capacity.
Note that SegWit is a technological upgrade to Bitcoin that acts to increase the maximum data capacity of Bitcoin blocks. Prior to June 2021,
SegWit adoption
was below 55%, meaning the maximum block capacity was smaller than it is now. However, given SegWit adoption has now reached in excess of 72%, there is more effective blockspace capacity, yet current congestion is even lower than it was in May 2021.
This indicates that overall,
the Bitcoin network remains HODLer dominated, and as yet, there has not been any noteworthy return of new demand
, as viewed through the lens of on-chain activity.
Live Advanced Chart
On a more positive note however, the capacity in
Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) public channels continues to print new all-time-highs
. Total LN public capacity has now reached 4,405 BTC, which is an increase of 19% over the last two months, despite the prevailing bear market.
This metric measures the liquidity available for users to send value routed through nodes that have public channels, and is a good gauge for expanding network effects. It does not account for private channels setup between two counter-parties whom have not opened up their node for public routing.

A Short Burst of Ethereum Activity
The Ethereum network has experienced many of the same trends as Bitcoin over the last 12-months, seeing a gradual deterioration of aggregate network usage and congestion. Despite powerful price action over the last few weeks, Ethereum network congestion is in fact the lowest it has been in some time, manifesting as multi-year lows in gas prices paid for confirmation.
Ethereum transaction demand has been in a gradual decline since the May 2021 sell-off, seeing only a short burst of activity in recent weeks.
If this trend can continue higher, it may be constructive, and is one to keep an eye on.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Transaction Count (14 SMA)
breaking above 1.25M would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
Ethereum tends to have a larger pool of transactions in the mempool compared to Bitcoin, and consistently sees blockspace filled to 99%+ capacity. As a result, the gas price paid is often a superior method for tracking true congestion.
This acts to capture the urgency of users seeking transaction confirmation, as measured by the value they are willing to spend on fees.
The chart below shows:
üü¢
Average Gas Limit
which is the maximum gas that miners can fit in a block (currently 15M, but can expand to 30M under EIP1559).
üî¥
Average
Gas consumption per block
which is the actual usage profile relative to the Gas Limit.
üîµ
Median Gas Fee
in Gwei which can be seen to expand in periods of demand, and contract during quiet periods of low congestion.
Live Advanced Workbench
Ethereum gas prices have recently declined to just 17.5 Gwei on a 7-day median basis. This is the lowest network congestion and gas price since May 2020, which was prior to DeFi Summer, and before the initiation of the bull market.
This signals that despite recent positive price action, there has not been an influx of new usage, and overall, the Ethereum is at a multi-year low in relative activity.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Median Gas Price (7 SMA)
breaking above 30 Gwei would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
As a result,
the ETH burn rate via EIP1559 is now at an all time low
. Total ETH burned is now just 11% of the total issuance. Ethereum has only crossed into deflationary territory on three occasions in the past under the current issuance schedule.
This effectively means a relatively large volume of ETH is making it into circulation
in comparison to all post-EIP1559 history
.
Live Advanced Workbench
Absorbing Profits
To close this piece, we will assess the market structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum through the lens of the SOPR metric. SOPR captures the average profit (> 1.0) or loss (< 1.0) realized by the market on spent coins. Generally speaking:
üü¢
High values (> 1.0)
indicate larger magnitude profits are being realized, and the market has sufficient demand flowing in to absorb it.
üîº
Bull Market Support
is characterised by SOPR values of 1.0 acting as support, as investors buy at their cost basis during pull-backs.
üî¥
Low Values (< 1.0)
indicate larger magnitude losses are being realized and investors are selling coins below their cost basis on average.
üîΩ
Bear Market Resistance
are characterised by SOPR values of 1.0 acting as resistance, as investors sell at their cost basis during rallies.
For Bitcoin, SOPR is attempting to break above 1.0 for the second time since early June. Usually, the market requires a number of attempts before escape velocity can be reached. An ideal bullish scenario would be a break above 1.0, and then a retest, finding support.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
BTC SOPR (7 SMA)
breaking above 1.0 and holding that level would signal profitability is returning, and a possible market recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
Ethereum has had more luck, piercing above a SOPR value of 1.0, and finding its first retest as support. However, given the somewhat lacklustre on-chain activity metrics explored above, it is prudent to watch for a reversal back below 1.0, which could signal weakness. This would resemble previous bearish periods where a brief excursion above 1.0 can be observed, before rejecting back into net loss territory.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
SOPR (7 SMA)
breaking below 1.0 and would signal a decline in profitability, and indicate potential market weakness.
Live Advanced Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen a rebound in prices this week, coming off the back of extremely oversold conditions, and spurred on by risk-on sentiment following the July FOMC meeting.
However, under the surface, on-chain transactional demand remains lacklustre at best, and this rally has not yet seen a convincing follow through in observable demand activity. The net result is that Bitcoin blocks are partially empty, Etheruem gas prices are at multi-year lows, and the rate of EIP1559 burning is at all-time-lows.
Of course, on-chain activity is only part of the picture, and early signs of SOPR profitability returning are encouraging. Attention can now shift to whether these uptrends can be sustained and improve, as a gauge for whether this is simple bear market relief, or a more constructive structural shift.

With market conditions still recovering from a fairly volatile June, there are subtle shifts occurring in positioning within Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives markets.
In this weeks newsletter, we will explore a notable divergence which has developed in the futures and options markets, centred around the Etheruem Merge scheduled for September. Traders appear to be utilising call options to bet on the ETH price into September, whilst futures and options backwardation indicate an expectation to sell-the-news is in play.
This appears to be relatively sophisticated market positioning, adding further evidence of institutional capital being deployed into the maturing liquidity of futures and options markets.

The Bitcoin Baseline
To start our analysis, we will assess how derivatives markets are pricing Bitcoin, given there are few protocol level fundamental changes affecting the near term pricing.
Since the start of April, Bitcoin futures markets have seen a dramatic increase in open interest, lifting off the baseline of around 350k BTC, and reaching new heights of 538k BTC. Growth is led by a handful of exchanges, primarily Binance, Deribit, OKEx, Bybit, FTX and CME.
Comparing open interest in a BTC denomination helps isolate periods of growth in futures leverage, from coin price changes. On a USD basis, current open interest is $12.4B, which is relatively low, and equivalent to the early bull market in Jan 2021, and at the $29k sell-off lows in June 2021.

Futures trade volume appears to have stabilised in the post-LUNA collapse era. Trade volume experienced a structural decline over the 12-months since the May 2021 sell-off, but appears to be re-establishing a floor at around $33B/day.
Given the large scale increase in open interest (on a relative scale), this may indicate that traders are increasingly willing to take on Bitcoin price exposure following the two major capitulation events in May and June.

A structural change has also taken place in futures markets over the last 18-months. The proportion of coin-backed margin has declined from 70%, to a new normal baseline of around 40% dominance. In other words, approximately 60% of futures margin is now posted via stablecoin and fiat collateral, removing the added volatility brought on by collateral value changing alongside the futures contracts.
This means that whilst futures leverage is high, the underlying margin appears to be much more stable, reducing the impact of negative convexity in contrast to early 2021.
Live Professional Chart
Futures are pricing Bitcoin in a state of contango, where traders must pay a slight premium to obtain exposure to Bitcoin in the future. This is the more common condition for Bitcoin markets, and the premium out to years end is just 3.24%. This cash-and-carry yield is only barely competitive with yields available on US treasuries, and thus hardly indicative of any long-term bullish bias just yet.
Live Professional Chart
A similar level of neutrality can be seen in the perpetual swap funding rates, which are slightly positive, and yielding 2.3% on an annualized basis. As per the calendar futures, slightly positive yield is normal, and the level of funding rates suggest there is relatively little bias in either direction.
Overall, Bitcoin futures markets appear to stabilising in trade volume, and are suggesting a slight bias towards upside. Open interest is high on a BTC relative basis, however not so much on a USD basis. This appears to indicate that traders are increasingly willing to take on BTC price exposure, but are not 'betting the farm' just yet.

Live Advanced Chart
Merge Calling
On the other side of the fence however, derivatives traders are placing directionally obvious bets for Ethereum, specifically relating to the upcoming Merge planned on 19 September. For the first time in history, Ethereum options open interest at $6.6B is now higher than for Bitcoin at $4.8B.
Whilst not an all-time-high yet, ETH options OI is close to setting a new one, whilst Bitcoin open interest remains well below the peak at just 35% of the ATH.
Live Advanced Chart
If we look the the September contracts on Deribit, the directional bias of Ethereum traders is immediately clear. Call options dwarf put options for size, with traders betting on ETH prices upwards of $2.2k, with significant open interest even out to $5.0k.
The max pain price however is currently at around $1.35k, which would lead to the maximum number of options expiring out of the money. Given this is below the spot price as of today, it sets up for a very interesting month ahead.
Live Professional Chart
This large buy side demand for ETH call options expiring in September has pushed the volatility smile into a state of extreme bullish bias. Overlaid on this chart are open interest bars, where it can be seen that the upwards slope is driven heavily by traders willing to pay a premium for long call exposure.
Implied volatility for this contract is well above 100% at almost all strike prices. The most bullish traders, who are buying call options above $5k, are willing to pay a premium of over 130% implied volatility.
Live Professional Chart
If we compare the shape and scale of the September volatility smile to October, we can see a dramatic decline on the right tail, with a relatively flat shape, and sub-110% IV across the curve. This suggests a relatively lower demand for ETH exposure via options after the Merge event.
Interestingly, post merge, the left tail is pricing in significantly higher implied volatility, indicating traders are paying a premium for 'sell-the-news' put option protection post-Merge.
Live Professional Chart
Selling the Future News
Given the strongly bullish bias in ETH options markets, it would be expected that spot demand would be quite strong. However, a look to the exchange net position change shows just -$700M on net withdrawn per month.
Whilst $700M is a large sum, exchange withdrawals pale in comparison to the recent peaks of $3B+ per month, and also in comparison to the $6.6B in options open interest. Monthly exchange withdrawals today are just 2% the size of futures trade volume, whereas this ratio reached over 20% in April 2022 and November 2021.
Live Advanced Chart
The futures term structure for ETH is remarkably different to the Bitcoin curve in shape, and is in a condition of backwardation. This means that futures traders are pricing ETH at a discount post Merge, aligning with the higher premium paid by options traders.
Whilst the discount is only small, just -2.27% annualized, it does suggest there is a large degree of short activity in the calendar futures markets. The most probable explanation is that investors are utilizing futures markets to both hedge downside risk, and perhaps finance the premiums paid on the options positions.
Live Professional Chart
Lastly, we can see that demand for short calendar futures (3-month basis) is manifesting as a negative cost of carry, reaching around -3.68% annualized. This confirms that traders are willing to pay a premium for downside protection, with eyes on the Merge for both upside speculation into it, and a sell-the-news event after the fact.
This demonstrates how traders are placing increasingly sophisticated positions, utilizing the growing depth of futures and options markets. This however, is not reflected as strongly in spot markets, suggesting traders see the Merge primarily as an opportunity for price exposure, and less so as a case for a more fundamental spot position as yet.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
In this newsletter, we analyzed both futures and options markets, to assess what the market is pricing for in the near term. With Bitcoin as a baseline, it suggests that investors are willing to take on more price exposure, but have not yet taken on heavy exposure. There is little directional bias evident in Bitcoin derivatives markets.
On the Ethereum side however, traders are clearly holding a long bias, expressed heavily in options contracts centred in September. Both futures and options market are in backwardation after September, suggesting traders are expecting the Merge to be a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' style event, and have positioned accordingly.
Spot withdrawals for ETH from exchanges are however relatively small compared to recent demand peaks. This indicates that sophisticated traders are utilizing the depth of derivatives markets as the preferred instrument, to obtain price exposure, and hedging risk of the Merge event.

Expansion in Maturity
The amount of supply that has been dormant for at least 1yr can be used to provide insight into the cyclical nature of Bitcoin through distribution and accumulation cycles.
Distribution Cycles
are a characteristic of a Bull Market, as the incentive to realize value increases for participants with mature coins. This leads to a reduction of 1yr+ old supply as coins are spent and sold.
Accumulation Cycles
are a characteristic of Bear Markets, as the magnitude of potential profit wanes alongside a collapse in price. HODLing gradually becomes the primary dynamic. This leads to an increase of supply older than 1yr.
Currently, Supply Active 1+ Years sits just below the previous ATH set in May 2022 at 65%. This highlights the significant conviction of May-July 2021 buyers after the great miner migration. The equilibrium over the last three months indicates that coin maturation is in balance with spending. This is can be considered a constructive mechanic within a bear market.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Percent of Supply Last Active 1+ Years
Ago breaking above 65.72% would signal a new ATH in supply dormant for a year, this suggest increased probability of a topping formation.
Live Advanced Chart
This phenomena can be further inspected by isolating coins from the HODL Waves age bands of 6 Months to 3 Years. HODL waves provides insight into the volume of BTC held for at least a minimum duration, which provides a proxy for analyzing buyers from the 2020-22 cycle, many of whom are likely experiencing their first bear market cycle.
The 6m-12m band can be seen to expand post the Great Miner Migration as HODLers refused to sell at the lows, this supply swell coincides with a bottoming in supply active 1yr+ ago. Within a HODLer dominant regime, supply was able to mature leading to a swelling of the 1y-2y age band following the Nov 2021 ATH.
Live Advanced Chart
The Realized Cap HODL Waves can then be used to assess the USD wealth held in these same age bands. Here we can see an even more intriguing result, where overall USD value held in these cohorts has surged by 52%, now accounting for 63% of the Realized Cap.
The price insensitivity of the Smart Money cohort can be highlighted by this continued increase, which suggests minimal spending, and investors allowing held BTC to mature regardless of price appreciation (Nov 2021), and subsequent capitulation (May 2022 - Current).
Smart Money can be seen to be in a structural uptrend expanding its USD wealth by 51% equivalent to a $220B increase culminating in a total balance of $267B.
Therefore, 37% of the Circulating Supply (7M BTC) represents 63% of the network USD wealth (based on value at the time of acquisition) underscoring the relative economic weight of the cohort.
Live Advanced Chart
Bitcoin cycles are driven by an ever-evolving supply balance between longer-term investors, and newer speculative buyers. The RHODL Ratio distils this concept into an oscillator by comparing the USD wealth of 1 week old coins, to those held by the 1y-2y old cohort.
This can be considered under the following framework:
An uptrend in the RHODL Ratio
suggests dominance of USD wealth held by new, speculative buyers, which is typical of peak speculation and Bitcoin market tops.
A downtrend in the RHODL Ratio
indicates dominance of USD wealth held by older coins, suggesting increased HODLing and long-term accumulation behavior.
A flat, range bound RHODL Ratio
indicates that the rate of change between old and young dominance is at an equilibrium. This a transition period. is often observed around market transition periods such as distributive markets tops and accumulation bottoms.
Currently, we are seeing the RHODL Ratio trade within a strong downtrend, confirming that the balance of USD wealth continues to shift back towards longer-term patient holders.
Live Advanced Chart
The Long-Term Holder Supply can then be employed to provide an assessment of the behavior of holders whom have a statistically higher conviction in the asset. Note that the 155-day threshold for LTH status üîµ brings us to the March 2022 region, where price experienced the first post-ATH relief rally towards $46K.
By observing the total supply held by the Long-Term Holder cohort, we can make two observations:
LTH Supply has been range bound
between 13.56M to 13.27M BTC
since the November 2021 ATH
, declining by just 300K BTC.
Since the Luna Sell off in May 2022, LTHs have seen a sustained decline in supply
amounting to -150K BTC.
Recent spending behavior by Long Term Holder is currently larger in coin volume than the HODLing from the pre-LUNA consolidation zone. This results in a modest, but observable decline in held supply.
Note that LTH supply does not need to aggressively decline for the cohort to be experiencing a capitulation event under the surface. Historically, LTH supply tends to trade only slightly lower during such events as the weakest of the cohort are flushed out, and generally balanced by more resilient accumulation that takes time to mature.
Live Professional Chart
Compression and Contraction
When considering the Circulating Supply for Bitcoin, we can inspect it from three components: the Long-Term, Short-Term, and Exchange held supply.
Beginning with Exchange Balances, Exchanges continue to experiences a macro decline in supply held, with this trend developing since the March 2020 capitulation event. Year to date, exchange outflows have continued with generally increasing intensity as prices declined. This underscores a persistent structural demand, from both small and large investors, for sovereign self custodial assets.
On balance, Exchanges have seen a net outflow of -100K BTC following the May 2022 LUNA capitulation, which accounts for 3.2% of the total outflows since the March 2020 ATH.
Live Advanced Chart
Next, we can assess the other two components held outside exchanges, the Long Term and Short Term Holder supply.
As discussed, LTH supply has seen a slight decline of -200K BTC since recording an ATH in May 2022 but remains effectively range bound over the last 12-months. This highlights a relatively balanced inflow/outflow dynamic for this cohort.
On the contrary, STH supply continues to expand following a capitulation in price leading to a supply increase of+330k BTC.
Since the May collapse of LUNA, there has been a net transfer of -300k BTC from the combined LTHs, and exchanges, towards STHs. Given the accompanying price declines, this broadly describes a capitulation style event, as the swelling STH supply describes accumulation by buyers who stepped in during the flush out, and now own coins with a much lower cost basis.
Live Workbench
A Constructive Divergence
By definition, these coins were transferred into the Short-Term Holder cohort. Since the March 08 2020 LUNA collapse, STH supply increased by +330k BTC.
Extreme STH accumulation is normally concurrent with bull market topping formations (marked in üîµ), however, a few bear market examples stand out against this trend (marked in üî¥):
The twin spikes of 300K+ inflows, which punctuated the start, and end of the 2015 bear market bottom.
The April to July 2019 relief rally out of the bear market lows.
The March 2020 capitulation event.
The June 2022 sell-off below the last cycle $20k peak, with a spike of 300K+ BTC.
STHs are normally adept at buying tops and selling bottoms, however, the distinct footprint of the above described events can be considered an exception to the trend. Both inflow events were in response to extreme drawdowns in price actions as well as severe STH outflows following bull market culminations.
Such events describe a transfer of coins to new buyers whom are initially classed as STHs, but have a low cost basis, but are in an advantageous financial position to HODL from there on.
Live Workbench
Having established a case that this spike in STH cohort coins likely describe bear market floor buyers, we can also see this captured in the
BTC denominated
supply balance for Young Coins (< 3-months). We can see supply peaks in 2015 (x3), Nov 2018, March 2020, and during our most recent sell off.
Simultaneously, these supply peaks tend to occur at the macro lows of young supply. This signals both a final flush out of sellers, followed by months of gradual accumulation, and the withdrawal of coins from the actively traded market.
Live Advanced Chart
The
USD denominated wealth
of the Young Coin cohort has been in structural decline following the March 2021 topping formation. This is a result of both the accumulation behavior (allowing coins to mature), but also the revaluation of coins to cheaper and cheaper prices during the bear.
A growing divergence can be identified between the aforementioned cohorts
USD wealth (Realized Cap HODL Waves)
and their respective
BTC denominated supply (HODL Waves)
.
The spike in BTC denominated value is not reflected in the USD denominated chart. This is because whilst 300k BTC in coin volume was transferred, their USD realized value has declined from say $50k-$60k, to $20k, which is notably lower.
This bolsters the case that
we may very well have seen a meaningful capitulation take place in recent months
. However, the onus is now on these new Short Term Holder bulls to hold the line.
Live Advanced Chart
Summary and Conclusions:
In this newsletter, we assessed the relative distribution of supply and wealth for both Young and Old coins, to further understand the Bitcoin ownership structure. We established that the supply has undergone a significant transfer of wealth in recent months, with an observable and widespread capitulation, and thus equal and opposite accumulation.
Long Term Holder Supply has seen a local, modest decline as spending behavior dominates following the LUNA collapse. However, LTH supply remains relatively range bound, which indicates more contained spending by a sub-set, rather than broad loss of confidence.
In contrast, Short Term Holders are seeing a divergence between BTC and USD denominated wealth. This is indicative of a pool of buyers who stepped in at the lows, and now hold some 300k BTC, acquired at a much lower cost basis. Now we turn to see if they have the conviction to hold on.

The Realized Price currently trading at $21.7k, while spot prices are slightly below the Realized Price at $21.3k. During the 2018-2019 bear market, prices fluctuated below the Realized Price for 140 days, making the prevailing bear market duration of 36 days relatively brief, and thus indicating more accumulation time may be required (as discussed in

Diving Back Underwater
With the Realized Price now overhead, two additional on-chain price models sit below the market as potential support levels.
Delta Price
and
Balanced Price
are well-known on-chain models with a track record for converging with prices around cycle bottoms.
Delta Price ($13,760
üü£) is a hybrid pricing model founded on both Technical and On-chain bases. It is calculated as the difference between the Realized and the all-time Average Prices. Delta price has previously caught the bottom wicks of bear markets.
Balanced Price ($17,180
üîµ)represents the difference between Realized Price and Transferred Price (
coinday time-weighted price
). This can be thought of as a form of 'fair value' model, capturing the difference between what was paid (cost-basis) and what was spent (transferred).
The chart below highlights the similarities between the current market structure and the bottom formation phase in 2018-2019.
Live Advanced Workbench
An Opportunity For Distribution
Initially, we will examine the
Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort
to provide granular insight into the accumulation/distribution behavior of all market participants separated by wallet size. Zooming in on the recent recovery from the local bottom in mid-Jun, we can observe two distinct phases:
Phase A
üü°: After crashing below $20k, Shrimps (<1 BTC) and Whales (>10k BTC, excluding exchanges and miners) were net accumulators, while other investing classes showed a Balanced Regime.
Phase B
üî¥: Following the initial reclamation of the Realized Price, all cohorts seized the opportunity to distribute their coins. Interestingly Shrimps' persistent strong accumulation momentum (<1 BTC) has also weakened in this phase.
Therefore, the recent price appreciation triggered a distribution phase across the board, adding sell pressure to the market.
Live Professional Metric in the Engine Room
Tracking Demand via Network Activity
Following the principles of Supply-Demand, the sustainability of a bear market rally can be critiqued when the Supply side is not balanced by new Demand and rising network activity.
The number of unique
New Addresses
which appeared for the first time is an effective tool to gauge the activity in the network. Due to intraday volatility in activity, the absolute value of new addresses on any given day can be uninformative. However, the trend of new addresses entering the market can provide a strong signal for network activity. Therefore, we shall compare the monthly average of new addresses against the yearly average to underline relative shifts in dominant sentiment and help identify the tides turning for network activity.
Bear Market Confirmation
üî¥: Alongside prices plunging from the April 2021 ATH, the 30 DMA of the New Address fell sharply below the 365 DMA. This established confirmation that the bear market phase was likely in effect through the lens of network activity.
New Demand Confirmation
üü¢: After a lengthy market consolidation phase, an abrupt spike of 30 DMA above 365 DMA for New Addresses has historically signalled a promising sign of new demand entering the market.
Examining the recent spot price bounce above realized price shows that the monthly average of New Addresses is still lower than the yearly average üü°. This pattern can be considered a validation of low demand in the market.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
New Addresses (30 SMA)
breaking above 408k (365 SMA) ¬†would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Workbench
Probing further into the demand side,
Miner Revenue From Fees
allows for evaluation of the competitiveness of Block space. This can be considered a measurement of network congestion and demand for inclusion in the next block.
Low Demand
üî¥: The early stages of bear market realization frequently coincide with the evaporation of fees from miners‚Äô revenue. Here, the typical range of 2.5% to 5% has acted as a historical threshold between high and low demand in the market.
High Demand
üü¢: In contrast, a sustained entrance above the aforementioned 2.5%-5.0% range can be considered a constructive sign for assessing a new wave of demand.
The current structure of this metric demonstrates a low but noticeably rising level of demand for block space. Despite its simplicity, measuring the momentum of paid fees for total settled value is an insightful macro indicator for assessing the complex dynamics of increasing network demand.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Percent Miner Revenue From Fees (30 SMA)
breaking above 2.5% ¬†would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Chart
The presence of retail investors in the network can be gauged by analyzing the long-term trend of small transactions. The following chart displays the 90D moving average of the total volume of transactions with a USD value of less than $10K.
Assuming small-size transactions are primarily attributed to retail investors, the quarterly smoothed average of this metric can be used to track the dominant sentiment of the market. Long-lasting bullish phases üü© are attractive to retail investors and bearish periods are less üü•, so the trend of small transaction volumes can be used to gauge the market atmosphere.
Interestingly, the recent positive movement towards $24.4k was not accompanied by any shift in retail-sized transfer volume or demand üü¶. This pattern adds additional confirmation of the underlying weakness of this market rally.
Live Professional Chart
Looking at the stacked
Total Inflows & Outflows to All Exchanges (USD value)
, we can also extract a similar correlation between the cyclical behavior of Bitcoin prices and USD-denominated exchange inflows üü• and outflows üü©. Exchange flows have now declined to multi-year lows, returning to late-2020 levels. Similar to the retail investor volumes, this suggests a general lack of speculative interest in the asset persists.
Live Advanced Workbench
To establish an explicit indicator based on this connection between exchange flows and wider market sentiment, we defined a new metric,
Exchange Flow Multiple
. This metric equals the ratio between monthly averaged exchange flows and its yearly average value.
Exchange flows are defined as the average of USD-denominated inflow and outflow volumes related to all exchanges (i.e. inflows + outflows divided by 2).
The
Exchange Flow Multiple
can be used as a threshold level which can be used to map the early üî¥ and later stages üü¢ of a bear market. In agreement with previously discussed charts, the recent price comeback from the Jun 2022 bottom üü¶ was not accompanied by a significant influx of speculators into the market.
Thus, from the above observations, it appears the recent price rally had little substance behind it from an on-chain perspective and thus confirms the weakness we originally highlighted in
WoC 31
.
Live Advanced Workbench
Short-Term Holder Confidence
Monitoring Network Demand and Activity with an emphasis on retail investors and speculators can provide insight into mapping the twilight stages of a bear market. However, to complete this puzzle, we will close with an evaluation of
Short-Term Holders‚Äô Confidence
.
The current market structure does resemble past bottom formation patterns, as discussed in
Week On-Chain 29
report. Generally nonspeaking, after a lengthy accumulation phase has taken place, any positive price movement tends to bolster the confidence of short-term investors with a cost basis near equivalent to market value.
In line with this, a sustainable bullish uptrend is usually accompanied by two macro shifts:
Declining Realized Losses
as all remaining sellers are exhausted from the market.
Profits Realized by Short-Term Holders
as new demand absorbs sell-side pressure.
Decreasing Realized Loss
Investigation of the 2018-2019 bear market shows that at the very final stages of bottom formation, the
Net Realized Profit/Loss (90DMA)
has gradually recovered to neutral, as the final sellers are exhausted from the market.
We use the Net Realized Profit/Loss (90DMA), looking for a structural decline in Realizing Net Losses üîµ. If it persists longer, this pattern pivots to Realizing Net Profits that the market can comfortably absorb. The current inclination towards net loss realization demonstrates the price vulnerability against any negative forces in the market.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
Net Realized Profit/Loss (90 SMA)
breaking above Zero would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Workbench
Absorption of Profit Taking
Looking at the
Short-Term Holders SOPR (90DMA)
, we can see a quarterly-smoothed ratio of investor selling prices relative to buying prices. The important threshold level in this metric is a cross-over of 1.0, with a break above indicating a return to profitable spending.
Following the capitulation from the November ATH, short-term holders (top buyers) realized heavy losses, causing a sharp drop in Short-Term Holders SOPR (90DMA) below 1 üü•.
This phase is usually followed by a period of low conviction, where the break-even value of 1 acts as overhead resistance. This occurs because investors are quite willing to sell at or around their cost basis to simply
get their money back
üü°.
Finally, after sufficient bottom accumulation takes place, a sustainable break above 1.0 often confirms that new capital is flowing into the market and is absorbing the profit taken by short-term holders üü©.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
STH-SOPR (90 SMA)
breaking above 1.0 would signal an uptick in on-chain profitability, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
In this report, we have discussed the main factors that led to the weakness and subsequent rejection of the price from $24.4k back below the Realized Price. Investors from a variety of wallet-size cohorts decided to distribute during the recent rally above the market average cost basis level.
The recent price uptrend also failed to attract a significant wave of new active users, which is particularly noticeable amongst retail investors and speculators. The monthly momentum of exchange flows is also ¬†not suggesting a new wave of investors entering the market, implying a relatively lacklustre influx of capital .
The current market structure is certainly comparable with the late-2018 bear market, however does not yet have the macro trend reversal in profitability and demand inflow required for a sustainable uptrend. Therefore, the ongoing cycle bottom consolidation phase is most likely, as Bitcoin investors attempt to lay a firmer foundation, subject of course to the persistent uncertainty and unfavourable events of the macroeconomic backdrop.

The Euro has once again traded below USD parity as the European energy crisis worsens, and the DXY Dollar Index has punched up to a new twenty year high above 109.30.
With the US Federal Reserve governors continuing to signal a hawkish stance on inflation at Jackson Hole, Bitcoin, as a developing index for global liquidity, reacted accordingly. Prices traded lower this week, coming off a high of $21,781, and hitting a multi-week low of $19,611.
In this edition, we will continue our assessment
from last week (WoC 34)
, exploring how near-term weakness continues to be visible across many Bitcoin fundamental metrics. This creates a condition where prices are trading lower, even with very little additional sell-side pressure on-chain. This continues to signal both persistently weak demand, as well as an investor base who is willing to take whatever exit liquidity the market offers them, to 'get their money back' at cost.

Falling In the Breeze
We will start our assessment from the lens of lifespan metrics, which broadly describe the age of coins that are being spent on-chain. Generally speaking:
Lower lifespan values
signify younger coins dominate transactions. It is usually encountered as the bear market grinds lower, and speculators are purged from the market.
Higher lifespan values
signify older coins dominate transactions. It is usually experienced during bull markets as profits are taken, but also during bearish capitulation events, due to panic selling.
ASOL tracks the average age per spent output, but ignores coin volume. It has been in a macro decline since Jan 2021, coincident with the prevailing bear. It spiked higher over recent weeks, as a group of older coins were spent, however this was only for a fleeting moment.
Weak price action without a sustained trend higher in ASOL signifies that the available demand can barely hold up the day to day sell-side pressure, let alone additional spending by profit takers and/or capitulation events was to take place.
Live Professional Chart
We can further inspect this by looking at Dormancy, which is the average age per unit coin moved. This metric does account for spent coin volume. Here we can see that the average age per coin is near multi-year lows, which means the ASOL spike was actually very light on BTC volume, bolstering the observation of very weak demand for Bitcoin.
If prices were climbing, this would be a very constructive signal, as it shows older coins are staying dormant. As it stands, however, this indicates the reverse, whereby prices are still struggling to hold the line even with older coins staying put in investor wallets.
Live Advanced Chart
At a macro scale, the Coin-Years Destroyed metric continues to push lower, reaching a relatively significant low. This metric aggregates the total lifespan destroyed (in years) over the last 365-days, and similar to dormancy, low levels are usually constructive and typical of late stage bear markets.
It remains plausible that the Bitcoin market is trading within what may become a longer-term bottom formation pattern. However, it is clear that the market is only just hanging on at present and is far from out of the woods yet.
Live Advanced Chart
To really hammer home this point of fundamental weakness, we can top it off with the Active Entities chart below. This metric can be considered analogous to 'unique daily active users' of the Bitcoin network, and it is currently testing the lower end of the long-standing Bear Market Channel.
This indicates that there is little growth in the active user-base, and the network is currently trafficked by the bare minimum user base we would consider to be within 'historical bounds.' Should Active entities decline much further, it would suggest an unfortunate deterioration of the user base, and enter a zone of aggregate weakness which has not been seen for many years.

whilst a break above 250k/day could signal an influx of new user demand.
Live Professional Chart
To end this first section on a slightly brighter note, it is quite clear that no widespread loss of HODLer conviction has taken place. The decline in lifespan metrics actually bodes well for the longer-term, as it indicates old coins are stationary, and declining prices have little psychological impact on this cohorts' conviction.
Whilst the resolve of the strong hands remains rock solid, it simply appears that their available demand inflows have not yet rebuffed the bears, who have driven the bulls back to the $20k line.

Sold At Break Even Prices
In the section above, we established that the current Bitcoin user base performance is lacklustre at best, and that price action remains remarkably weak, even as older coin expenditure declines. To make matters worse, investor psychology appears to be one that is keen to simply 'get my money back,' with a great degree of spending taking place at and around their cost basis.
In aggregate, Bitcoin investors are realizing around $220M/day in net losses. On a relative scale, this is quite modest in magnitude, especially relative to recent multi-billion dollar capitulation events. However, even with this relatively light capital outflow of $220M/day, the bulls are fighting an uphill battle.

Looking at the aSOPR metric, we can observe the average profit (or loss) multiple on spent coins. Generally speaking, an aSOPR value near 1.0 is of heightened interest:
aSOPR of 1.0 in a bullish trend
üü¢ often acts as support, as investors
buy the dip
and add to their position at or around their cost basis. This also signifies profitable coins prefer to stay dormant, reducing sell-side pressure at the lows.
aSOPR of 1.0 in a bearish trend
üî¥ often acts as resistance, as investors
sell the rally
and offload their position at or around their cost basis. Psychologically this reflects a mentality of 'getting my money back' on whatever exit liquidity the market offers.
The recent sell-off was initiated after a convincing underside retest of 1.0 at a time where prices reached above $24k. Rejection from this level largely confirms weakness lay on the road ahead, as investors took the exit liquidity and spent coins around their acquisition cost basis.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
aSOPR (7DMA)
breaking above
1.0
would signal
that aggregate spending is back in profit
, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
Bitcoin Long-Term Holders are also feeling the pinch, with LTH-SOPR values trading around 0.60 to 0.65 for several consecutive weeks. This indicates that investors who have held their coins for at least 5-months, and are statistically the least likely to spend, are locking in losses between -35% and -40% on average. Buyers from the 2021-22 cycle continue to exit their positions at a meaningful loss.
Whilst not as severe as the -50% peak losses in 2018 (to date), this current bear market competes meaningfully with the worst bears of the past on the basis of most damage done. A meaningful recovery of LTH-SOPR above 1.0 would be a constructive signal, however has historically taken a number of months to achieve this escape velocity.

Alert Idea
:
LTH-SOPR (7DMA)

Live Professional Chart
Finally, we close out with an aggregate view of recent on-chain losses, where we can see that the scale of capital outflow over the last month is historic. Surpassed only by the 2018 capitulation, the relative magnitude of investor losses in recent weeks is enormous, hitting 0.28% of the Market Cap per day.
Given this reality, it should be of little surprise that investors are willing to take whatever rallies and profits they can get.
Live Professional Chart in the Glassnode Engine Room
Summary and Conclusions
The 2022 bear market carries on and has clearly taken a toll on the aggregate Bitcoin investor base. Despite not seeing any widespread loss of conviction amongst the HODLers, as signalled by lifespan metrics in decline, the bulls still cannot establish a meaningful uptrend.
The psychology of investor spending patterns remains firmly in the bear market territory, as rallies are sold, and exit liquidity is taken at or around cost basis levels. Given the current remarkably low active user base, it could be considered impressive that the $20k level has held up to date.
It remains plausible that Bitcoin is in a bottom formation range and would be historically similar to all past bear markets. However, Bitcoin prices are just barely hanging on, and any uptick in the fundamentals would be a welcome change.

The Eurozone finds itself under increasing stress, with the balance of trade in deficit, concerns over energy shortages, and the Euro falling deeper below USD parity.
With weakness in almost all other currency pairs, the pressure remains on equities, bonds and Bitcoin markets alike. For Bitcoin specifically, the underlying market very much resembles the macro scene, with a volatile and uncertain short-term, whilst the longer-term outlook is more consistent, and characterized by well developed trends.
In this edition, we shall explore this dichotomy from the lens of market spending behaviors, inspecting regions of local distribution, within a macro scale accumulation regime. We shall supplement this assessment with more granular deep dives into various cohorts, including HODLers, Short-Term Holders, and by different wallet sizes to understand their isolated stress levels.

Local Distribution
To begin, we shall assess the degree of accumulation / distribution occurring in response to the current price range. The Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score can be used to understand participant spending behavior, and help contextualize the market response to price action.
In the last 12-months, we have seen four distinct phases:
Phase 1 (Accumulation)
: Following the capture of a new ATH in Nov 2021, investor elation translated into perfect accumulation scores, as the market readily bought what they believed to be an opportune dip.
Phase 2 (Distribution)
: A slow, but sustained collapse in price left the recent accumulators severely in loss. This sparked a transition in emotion from elation to desperation, as underwater participants distributed coins, as the bear market reality started to set in.
Phase 3 (Accumulation)
: The LUNA Collapse rippled across the heavily entangled leverage throughout the industry, prompting a unilateral, and wide-scale deleveraging event. Despite plunging the already weak market to new lows, participants reacted by transitioning into near broad scale accumulation throughout both capitulation legs below $30k, and then again below $20k.
Phase 4 (Distribution)
: Following months of accumulation, the market managed to rally above $24k, however as covered in
WoC 34
and
WoC 35
, this opportunity for exit liquidity was taken via distribution, and profit taking.
Live Advanced Chart
We can further isolate this behavior by cohorts, to assess the primary participants in each regime.
The cohort of most interest in the current market are the Whales (10k+ BTC) who have begun to aggressively distribute coins into the range highs of $24500, capitalizing on any exit liquidity present amidst global market uncertainty.
The excess supply provided to the Market by the Whales appears to have overwhelmed the already eroded demand side, culminating in the formation of a local top.
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room
We can confirm this behavior using the Whale-Exchange Net Position Change metric. This tool allows us to see the 30-day net change in Whale balances (1k BTC+), considering only coins flowing in and out of exchanges.
Positive values (
üü¢
)
indicate net Whale balance growth (and exchange withdrawals).
Negative values (
üî¥
)
indicate net Whale balance decline (and exchange deposits).
A stark reversal can be noted following the sell-off to $17.6k, where Whale transfers rapidly reversed towards net deposits to exchanges. Peak distribution was hit around the recent local top of $24.5k. This provides confluence with the results from the cohort analysis above, with the 10k+ cohort seen to be the dominant actor.
Live Professional Workbench
Macro Accumulation
Transitioning from a local time horizon to a macro perspective, we shall next assess the levels of accumulation / distribution occurring over a multi-year time frame
To assess the macro state of Bitcoin long-term behavior, we initially can turn to the Liveliness metric. Liveliness measures aggregate network activity by balancing the all-time aggregate Coin Day Destruction against all-time Coin Day Creation. The trend and gradient of it then provide information on wider market preferences for HODLing (downtrends) or spending (uptrends).
Liveliness is currently in a strong downtrend, and has convincingly broken below the triple peaks of the post 2018 bear market. This event suggests that Coin Days are being accumulated by the supply much faster than they are being destroyed, and is coincident with a HODLing dominant regime.
Live Advanced Metric
Next, we can inspect a derivative of Liveliness that brings it into the supply domain; the HODLer Net Position Change. This metric can be used to assess an implied monthly change to HODLed supply, with two notable phase shifts during this market cycle:
Price appreciation from Nov 2020 to Apr 2021 triggered a large scale HODLer distribution event, with long-term investors distributing at a peak rate of -150k BTC per month.
This period of distribution has been currently balanced by HODLer accumulation throughout the second half of 2021 to present. Currently, we are seeing a position change of +70k BTC per month, the largest monthly HODLer position change since March 2020.
Assessing the period from Nov 2020 to present day, we can observe that macro HODLing behaviour is at a multi-year high, reaching 70k BTC/month, and aligning with a longer-term conviction (even whilst price action remains dire).
Live Professional Metric
We can now critique the net effects of the two above described regimes. We can calculate the net supply change for the HODLer cohort since Nov 2020, at the start of the 2020-21 bull cycle, to observe the net HODLer inflows and outflows.
Phase 1: From Nov 2020 to May 2021
saw a cumulative outflow of -394k BTC in a few short months, as HODLer‚Äôs aggressively spent coins and took profits.
Phase 2: From May 2021 to Present
, a cumulative inflow of +394k BTC can be observed, effectively replenishing the previous distribution phase.
The aggressive period of distribution used to propel the initial 2021 bull run has been effectively counterbalanced by a consistent period of HODLer accumulation, spanning almost twice the duration of the distribution regime. This effectively describes an 'exuberance detox', which largely aligns with an expulsion of all Bitcoin tourists, a concept we started profiling in
WoC 27
.
Live Professional Workbench
We can support these observations from the ‚Äòimplied supply domain‚Äô, with observations from the measured Long-Term Holder (LTH) Supply. LTH Supply has seen an uptick of +250k BTC since the recent decline in supply, pushing the total balance to just 30k BTC shy of the ATH.
The coin age threshold to be considered LTH supply is approximately 155-days, putting the minimum acquisition date in early April 2022. This threshold currently sits within the peak of the aforementioned Phase 2 distribution phase, at a price around $46k, and just before the LUNA inspired sell-off took hold.
Thus it is possible that LTH supply slows and stagnates in the coming month, perhaps until mid-October where the threshold will be post-LUNA and well within the Phase 3 accumulation period.
Live Professional Metric
We can also compare LTH supply to the number of Accumulation Addresses, and to Illiquid Supply to gain a more comprehensive view of potential changes to supply dynamics. Note that Illiquid supply is defined as coins held in wallets with little, or no history of spending. Accumulation addresses are those which have received more than two payments, but have never spent.
STH-to-LTH threshold is shown on the chart below. This threshold aligns with an explosive increase in both Accumulation Addresses, as well as a ramp up in momentum for Illiquid Supply. Also note that both metrics have largely continued to push to new highs ever since.
This adds weight to a case that LTH supply may continue to push higher over coming months, which would provide confluence with the HODLer regime denoted by network Liveliness.
Live Professional Workbench
In the face of seemingly endless market uncertainty, the HODLer class are resolute in their conviction. Short of a significant reversal in LTH Supply, Liveliness, or HODLer Net position change, the longer-term prospects for Bitcoin actually remain quite constructive.
Thus we turn our attention to the near-term Short-Term Holder cohort, who by deduction, are more likely to be driving recent weakness in prices.
Short-Term Stress Test
The Entity-Adjusted URPD is below, and presents the supply distribution split into STH (red) and LTH (blue) supply. Here we can identify an extreme concentration of STH supply around the current price, reflecting recent acquisitions, and day to day trade volume.
However, following with recent drop in price, the majority of the STH Supply is now holding an unrealized loss, hurling this cohort into a severe degree of financial stress.
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room
By inspecting the percent supply in profit, we can supplement the thesis that the majority of transactions within the current price regions are propagated by STH cohort. By comparing the percentage change for the supply in profit between two price points, insight is provided into the the total number of BTC ‚Äútrapped‚Äù within the select range.
Therefore, we can observe that 13.3% of the circulating supply lost their profitable status during the move downwards from $24k to $19.6k. This suggests that 2.55M (13.3%) of the circulating supply last transacted within this price range.
Live Advanced Metric
This stress is echoed in absolute terms by the Short-Term Holder Supply in Loss. Here we can see that 1.53M STH owned coins fell below their break-even price during the move down from $24.4k.
Thus 1.53M out of 2.55M (60%) coins trapped within the aforementioned range are represented by Short-Term Holders. This is a disproportionate representation for a cohort with only a 16% share of the circulating supply, further demonstrating the movement of coins in this region is Short-Term Holder dominated.
Live Professional Metric
We can bolster the above observation with the percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply in Loss. The recent move from the local top of $24k plunged 50% of the aggregate STH Supply into loss in the span of just a few days.
This bring STH Supply in loss close almost to full saturation, with 96% of the STH Supply now underwater on their holdings. Full loss saturation has occurred three times within the prevailing downtrend, which interestingly marked local bottom formation events. This is in effect a result of capitulation, as sellers transfer coins to new STH buyers, who put in a local bottom, and then return to profit upon any meaningful price recovery.
Live Professional Workbench
With HODLer conviction remaining steadfast, the onus now falls to the Short-Term Holders to hold the line, as the market is clearly testing their resolve. It appears that the majority of daily trade volume and churn is being driven by recent buyers, as they jostle for the best entry.
Plunge Protection
Given the somewhat dire price action of late, and a high concentration of trigger happy STHs in the current price range, the chances of another capitulation event are non-trivial. Thus, it is prudent to prepare for all outcomes, and in the event of further price slippage, we can consult two pricing models hovering below the market:
The
Balanced Price
metric attempts to capture a fair value model for BTC. This is produced by calculating the difference between Realized Price (the aggregate sum paid for all coins) and the Transfer Price (the cumulative USD value of Coin Days Destroyed).
The
Difficulty Regression Price
attempts to model the all-in cost of production for Bitcoin mining, calculated by running a log-log regression model between Difficulty and Market Cap.
Both models supported the 1 hour wick during the capitulation to the current cycle low, and are currently providing a confluence of support at the $17k mark. Therefore, the two models pricing may be considered an area of interest, and a fundamentally derived area of support in the event of further market weakness.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The global bear market remains in full effect with price continuing to linger above range lows. Periods of price elation have been met with aggressive distribution from the largest of investor classes, as the search for exit liquidity persists. However, macro accumulation over a multi-year scale remains in effect, with HODLers and Long-Term Holders seemingly unfazed by prevailing economic conditions.
With HODLer conviction resolute, the market has begun to stress test its statistically weakest hands, the Short-Term Holders. This cohort has been the primary proponent of day-to-day acquisitions within the current price range, culminating in a large concentration of coins clustered around the current market value.
The most recent move lower in price action has lead to a large majority of the Short-Term Holder supply suffering unrealized losses. Thus, Short-Term Holders find themselves heavily questioned by the market in a Trial by Fire. Two outcomes remains, capitulation through heat, or a cohort emboldened, hardened by the very flames who questioned them.

Prices peaked at $21,758, but remain firmly within the consolidation range which has now been established for more than three months.
Since mid-August, the market has been trading down from the consolidation rage high, which peaked at around $24.5k. As the market reaches towards the range low this week, we have an opportunity to observe the volume of coins that flipped from an unrealized profit (at $24.5k) to an unrealized loss through this process. These moments provide valuable insight on to the degree of coin accumulation, and cost basis concentration within an established consolidation range.
In this edition, we will zoom in on this concept of on-chain cost basis, and changing coin profitability. We will also analyze a very rare event, where three ~5k BTC whale sized transactions, aged 7y-10y, were spent over recent weeks. These coins were accumulated back in Dec-2013, realizing over $163M in profit.

Discounts Across the Board
Bitcoin has now been within a persistent market downtrend for ten months since the ATH in November 2021. This week, Bitcoin spot prices touched the $18,649 level, marking the second lowest local low at a 72.5% ¬†drawdown from the cycle top. Compared to prior bear cyclical bottoms, the 2022 contraction has not been as significant on a percent drawdown perspective. The lows in 2015, 2018 and 2020 reached over 77%+ drawdowns from ATH.
However, even with a lower drawdown magnitude, the scale of financial loss in this bear market can be reasonably argued to be the largest in history (
covered in our June Report
).
Live Advanced Chart
In this edition, we will assess the current market structure using a framework, of weighing spot prices against the cost basis of distinct cohorts of market participants:
Overall Market (MVRV) üü†:
Measuring the ratio of spot price and the on-chain cost basis of all investors in the market
Long-Term Holders (LTH-MVRV) üîµ:
Calculates MVRV considering only Long-Term Holders, owning coins older than 155 days on average, and statistically the least likely to spend.
Short-Term Holders (STH-MVRV) üî¥:
Calculates MVRV considering only Short-Term Holders, owning coins younger than 155 days on average, and statistically the most likely to spend.
Historically, bottoming formation coincides with spot prices trading below all three of the aforementioned cost basis (i.e. MVRV < 1.0,
WoC 25
). This indicates a point in time where all cohorts are, in aggregate, holding an unrealized loss üü™.
The current bear market has spent 56 days in this condition, despite a brief bounce back above the Realized Price and Long-Term Holder variant. Compared to the typical duration of ~190-days below the Realized Price in previous bear markets, 56-days remains a relatively short period of time.
In line with our
June report
, the lowest STH-MVRV values recorded this cycle are lower than during the Dec 2018 capitulation, suggesting that Short-Term Holders in particular, have experienced a historically large degree of financial pain.
Live Professional Workbench
Next, we can compare the average acquisition price per coin for the STH cohort (üî¥) against the LTH average acquisition price (üîµ), to compare financial stress levels. Throughout the bear, persistent price depreciation leads the STH Realized Price to fall below the LTH Realized Price üü™.
Such events only occur during the late stage of bear markets, and denote periods where the average cost of acquisition over the past 155 days, is now more advantageous than the average long-term holder cost basis. This is synonymous with a capitulation, where coins purchased near the cycle top are sold and change hands at much lower prices.
Despite a 10-month downtrend, this bear market has not yet reached this cross-over stage. Previous bears took between 145 days and 339 days to recover after such a cross-over. by Given the trajectory of these two realized price traces, we can expect a cross-over by mid-September.
Live Professional Workbench
The market recently rejected the rally above $24.5k, giving us an opportunity to observe the volume of coins that have fallen from profit, back into an unrealized loss.
Core Concept
: Sharp price moves off the highs or lows of a consolidation range can be exceptionally rich in analysis value. These events highlight the volume of coins which swapped between holding an unrealized profit to an unrealized loss (or vice-versa). Metrics like
Percent Supply in Profit
can therefore be used to measure the volume of coins which changed hands within that concentrated price range.
Since mid-August, the total
Percent Supply in Loss
jumped by 11.8%, reaching 48.1%. As shown in the figure below, the contribution of Short-Term Holders üü• (9.3%) is significantly higher than Long-Term Holders üü¶ (2.5%)
.
This difference highlights the rising momentum of capital inflow in the period since spot prices crashed below the Realized Price in early Jun.
In other words, this high concentration of STH coins between $24k and $18.5k shows that 9.3% of the coin supply has recently transacted, suggesting both capitulation, and an equivalent demand inflow within this price range. It also highlights a risk, in that a large volume of investor coins (48.1% of supply) are underwater below $18.5k, and 11.8% of supply has a cost basis between $18.5k and $24.5k.
Live Professional Metric
Next, we will explore the
Realized Profit/Loss Ratio
metric, which measures the ratio between the volume of coins moved in profit, to those coins that are transferred in loss. Tracking the monthly average of this metric enables analysts to gauge shifts in market momentum, and sentiment, and to characterise the dominant profile of coins which are on the move.
Profit Dominant Regime>1
üü©: At the early stages of the bull markets, where new demand is strong enough to adsorb selling pressure, and profits are taken at scale. This metric has historically recorded a sharp cross over the 1.0 level in early bull phases.
Loss Dominant Regime < 1
üü•: During the extended phase of the bear markets, where the supply is not met with sufficient demand until the ultimate capitulation takes place. This indicator typically collapses and remains below 1.0 mid-way through a bear but is usually before capitulation, providing an early warning signal.
The interval between dropping below, and reclaiming the 1.0 level, is where bearish sentiment is at its peak, and due to inadequate demand liquidity. From a qualitative standpoint, the current
Low Liquidity
regime began ~4 months ago, and can be compared to the 6-month period experienced in the 2018-2019 bear.
An interesting observation is the upward trend which initiated in early June, and peaked in mid-August, having since descended to 0.58. This pattern reconfirms that an uptick in profit taking took place by investors during that relief rally (explored more in
WoC 35
).
üîî Alert Idea:
Realized Profit/Loss Ratio (30DMA)
breaking above 1.0 could signal recovery of investor profitability, and signal a constructive influx of new demand.

Before The Merge - Analyzing the Ethereum Beacon Chain
Bear Market Volatility
The picture portrayed so far highlights the significant role of Short-Term Holder behavior in recent price moves. Therefore, as a key cohort of interest, assessment of STH spending is paramount for identifying a resilient bottom formation. A core tool to examine Short-Term Holders‚Äô profitability is the
Short-Term Holder SOPR
, indicating the average profit multiple on spent coins.
The
STH-SOPR
structure provides a strong compass for mapping different bear market stages:
A) Post-ATH Phase
üü•: The heavy loss realization after the ATH bubble bursts manifests as an abrupt plunge to levels below 1, usually followed by a volatile market regime.
B) Bear Market Rallies
üü¶: As the bear market progresses, a fragile equilibrium forms as a by-product of weak demand, and new supply as holders seek exit liquidity. This stage is set for numerous bear market rallies, peaking at various profit and loss levels, but all ultimately failing to sustain breaks higher.
C) Post-Capitulation
üü®: As the time component of bear markets starts to exhaust investors psychologically, the potential of a capitulation event rises accordingly. Following this wash-out, a period of recovering profitability, and a SOPR uptrend often follows.
The June 2022 sell-off has many similarities to phase C, and the recent $24k rejection showed a convincing underside retest of STH-SOPR = 1.0, showing investors sold at their cost basis. Underside rejections like this are typical of bear market formation patterns.
üîî Alert Idea:
Short-Term Holder SOPR
and/or aSOPR breaking above 1.0 could signal a recovery of investor profitability and an improvement in underlying market strength.
Live Professional Metric
We can use the
STH Supply Profit/Loss Ratio
metric to assess the behavior of STHs during the transition from a bear to a bull market. This indicator measures the ratio of STH unspent coins in profit to those in the loss, a similar idea to SOPR, however, using unspent (held) coins rather than spent coins.
We can identify extremes in short-term holder market conditions:
STH-Supply Profit/Loss Ratio > 1
üü©: During bull markets, more than half of short-term holders‚Äô supply stays in profit, leading this ratio to fluctuate above 1. Higher values indicate a larger incentive for profit taking.
STH-Supply Profit/Loss Ratio < 1
üü•: Throughout bear markets, this ratio trades below 1 since the short-term holder supply is primarily in loss. Lower values indicate a larger probability of capitulation and where capitulation has taken place, preceding a strong recovery upwards.
Utilizing the 1.0 level as a reference point, we can anticipate potential pivot points for counter-trend events, such as bull market corrections, or bear market rallies. The recent rejection by the $24k level (‚ùå) was an example of a possible turning point for the bear market rally, which failed to gain momentum. However note the ascending lows of late, which is similar in structure to STH-SOPR, suggesting a slow, but observable recovery could be underway.
üîî Alert Idea:
Short-Term Holder Supply Profit/Loss Ratio
breaking above 1.0 could signal a recovery of investor profitability, and an improvement in underlying market strength.

Old Whales Come Back to Life
Bitcoin bear markets have the ability to flush out even the most steadfast investors. This regime of Low Profitability for LTHs can be observed via
LTH-SOPR.
Historically, a sharp break back above 1 has signalled the transition back to bullish momentum in the market.
Compared to 11 months of Low Profitability in the 2018-19 bear market üü•, the current market has
LTH-SOPR
trading below 1 for just 4 months. Occasionally, we can observe an abrupt spike higher in
LTH-SOPR
üü¶. These sudden spikes are usually attributed to the transfer of a large volume of older coins, which realize historically large profits.
üîî Alert Idea:
Long-Term Holder SOPR
breaking above 1.0 could signal a recovery of investor profitability, and an improvement in underlying market strength.
Live Professional Metric
Generally, decoding these events requires detailed investigation via detailed blockchain data science. In the next section, we will detail an analysis associated with the recent expenditure of three UTXOs, which contained over 5,000 BTC each, were all acquired in December 2013, and when bitcoin prices were $543.
First, to underline the significance of the recent bounce in
LTH-SOPR,
we can refer to the following chart presenting the daily spent volume of 7-10 Years old coins
.
Remarkably, there are only 11 instances in history where the daily volume of 7y-10y old coins crossed over 4k BTC/day, with three of them in the last two weeks.
Live Advanced Metric
The highlighted transactions can be characterized as follows:
A- Block # 751518, 28-Aug-2022 ($19.6k), Spending 5,000 BTC (1,500 BTC to an unknown receiver and 3,500 BTC to Kraken), Original Purchase Date: 19-Dec-2013 ($543.14)
B- Block # 751723, 29-Aug-2022 ($20.2k), Spending 5,000 BTC (BTC split to 170 addresses in one transaction), Original Purchase Date: 19-Dec-2013 ($543.14)
C- Block # 752637, 04-Sep-2022 ($19.9k), Spending 5,000 BTC (the immediate receiver of the transaction is Kraken), Original Purchase Date: 19-Dec-2013 ($543.14)
Therefore, the sudden peak in
LTH-SOPR
above was most likely attributed to these three old large wallets that realized a massive volume of profit by moving their funds acquired in late 2013. The following chart shows the two of these transactions which deposited funds into Kraken, realizing a total of $163.48M in profit on the 8.5k BTC sent directly to Kraken.
Live Advanced Metric
Summary and Conclusions
With Bitcoin trading 72.5% below the Nov 2021 ATH this week, the market has many similarities to the latest phase of the 2018-19 bear market. The recent bear market rally sold off from $24.5k down to below $18.5k, plunging a significant volume of short-term holder supply back into an unrealized loss.
All in all, the primary factors influencing the current market structure appear to be these short-term holders, whom are jostling for the best entry price, and what little profit is available to take. The sensitivity and conviction of these investors within the volatile macroeconomic environment is a key factor in near-term market direction. Long-Term Holders have experienced a significant wash-out already and generally shift towards keeping coins dormant during these phases.
The recent bear market rally failed to achieve escape velocity, as shown by rejections across numerous SOPR and investor profitability ratios. Inflows of demand have proven insufficient to date to absorb this sell-side pressure. The battle is now in defence of the $20k region, noting that bear market history often takes several months before the final touches on a bear market floor are established.

The switching of the consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), has been on the Ethereum roadmap, and actively worked on since genesis and is a remarkable milestone for the project.
As of 15-September at 06:46:46 UTC, at Ethereum blockheight 15,537,393, the final PoW mined block was produced, and the PoS Beacon Chain took over chain consensus.
The Ethereum Merge was successful.
Arguably, there is no better chart to demonstrate just how dramatic this transition was, than observing Ethereum Mean and Median blocktimes. Here we can clearly see the end of the probabilistic, and naturally variable PoW mining, and the switch to the engineered precision of PoS, sporting a consistent 12-second blocktime.

In this report, we will explore this historic event, as it happened, across both trading markets, and on-chain blockchain metrics. We will analyse the Merge from the following angles:

Selling The News
In our
WoC 32 Report
, we described how market positioning across Futures and Options markets appeared to be well hedged for a sell-the-news style event. Indeed, ETH prices have sold off, from a weekly high of $1,777, to around $1,650 at the time of the Merge, before collapsing to a low of $1,288 on Sunday.
The market has effectively given back all gains made since mid July. Such a sell-off is the result of multiple factors, not least of which being traders taking profits after ETHs recent out-performance. Being one of a small handful of assets that performed well during recent months in the prevailing macro-economic conditions, it is quite unsurprising that profits were taken, where profits were available.
Right up until the Merge, traders in perpetual futures markets were paying an eye-watering 1,200% annualized in funding rates to maintain their short ETH positions. This is a new all time low negative funding rate, eclipsing the previous peak of -998% hit during the March 2020 sell-off.
Funding rates have since completely reverted to neutral, suggesting much of the short-term speculation premium has dissipated.
Live Advanced Chart
Total Futures Open Interest declined by 15% from $8.0B to $6.8B after the Merge, with both of these extremes being fairly typical in the context of 2021-22 markets. However, to keep this change in context, we must account for the influence of a changing ETH coin-price, which affects the USD value of ETH-denominated futures position sizes.
Live Advanced Chart
If we inspect Open Interest in an ETH denominated basis, we can see that futures Open Interest is actually at all-time-high, having increased by almost 80% since early-May. Over the last week, there appears to have actually been an increase in futures leverage, rather than a decrease, suggesting many risk hedging positions have not been closed.
Live Advanced Chart
In options markets, where a
large amount of recent ETH speculation
took place, Call option Open Interest has declined by $600M post-Merge (a 10% decline). There remains a total of $5.2B in outstanding call option position value, which is still much higher than 2021 norms. Put option markets experienced a more significant relative drop of 19%, but this remains a much smaller scale $294M in net position value closed.
In many ways, it appears that ETH markets remain heavily utilized, levered up, and speculating on further upside, despite a -22% ETH price correction.
Live Advanced Workbench
The On-chain Merge
The end of the Proof-of-Work Ethereum era was marked by an immediate decline of mining difficulty to zero after the Merge. This process was instantaneous, with no wind-down period, nor any difficulty adjustments taking place. Revenue for PoW miners has effectively evaporated, leaving a fleet of GPU, and ASIC mining rigs seeking a new purpose.
Live Advanced Chart
In place of miners, PoS utilises a pool of validators, which are programmatically organised into sets of committees, and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. One validator is assigned the role of block producer for each 12-second slot. However, in some instances, this validator may be offline or unreachable at the time, resulting in a
Missed Block
.
Live Advanced Chart
We measure this aggregate validator network uptime using the
Participation Rate
metric, which is the ratio between the number of blocks successfully produced (i.e. not missed), and the total available slots. As the chart below shows, Participation rates well in excess of 99% have been the norm for much of the Beacon Chains life to date. It will be an interesting performance metric to watch as more load is imposed on the chain, and more validators enter the fold.
In the weeks leading up to the Merge, a slight decline in Participation Rate can be observed, falling below the typical 99% level to around 97.5%. Post-Merge, this has reverted back into the 99%+ range, suggesting only a brief disruption to some sub-set of validators.
Live Advanced Chart
The number of attestation votes on the chain-tip also experienced a brief pre-Merge decline, but has similarly recovered back into the expected 32k to 38k attestations/hour range. It is possible this reflects node issues with a larger sized staking operator, or perhaps a software client bug, where numerous validators were affected in a short window of time.
Live Advanced Chart
Ethereum currently has over 429.6k Active Validators on the network. The chart below shows the last 6-months, where the gradient of new validators can be seen to increase markedly in the lead up to, and following the Merge. Over 11.36k Validators have come online in September alone, signifying a growing investor confidence as the technical challenges of the Merge are de-risked.
Live Advanced Chart
When validators opt into, or out of the staking pool, they are constrained by a protocol set limit on total validator churn per Epoch. The chart below shows this cap (blue trace) alongside a somewhat barcode style chart, which shows the daily change in Active Validators. We can see a handful of periods where the influx of validators hit the limit cap in the past.
The recent burst of new validator activity in September is visible, although it remains quite light relative to the heavier periods seen in 2021.
Live Advanced Chart
With a total of 429.6k Active Validators, there is now over 14.586M ETH staked, representing 12.2% of the total ETH supply. The Total ETH staked will change over time as a result of:
New Deposits, and eventually Withdrawals
(after the Shanghai Fork)
Revenue earned from issuance and fees
(balance increase)
Inactivity leak
if validators often miss blocks or attestations (balance decreases).
Slashing
in the event of malicious behavior (balance decreases).
The Total Staked Balance differs from a new metric called Effective Balance, which is the portion of ETH which is actively participating in consensus. Effective Stake is capped per validator at 32 ETH on the upside, and decreases to the nearest 1 ETH increment below this in the event of leaking or slashing.
The total Effective Balance is currently at 13.801M ETH, resulting in a Stake Effectiveness rate of 94.6%.
Live Advanced Chart
A majority proportion of Staked ETH is hosted by a variety of staking service providers that we monitor, accounting for 10.071M ETH (69.04% of the total). The top 4 service providers are Lido, Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, whom manage a combined 8.18M ETH staked, account for 56.08% of the total stake.
One of the newest growing staking pools we monitor, Rocketpool, is a distributed validating node operator competing with market leader Lido. Rocketpool remains very small in scale, but is growing, with 228.2k ETH hosted, and representing 1.56% of the total stake so far.

Before The Merge - Analyzing the Ethereum Beacon Chain
The Reality of Supply
One of the most talked about components of the Merge has been the dramatic decline in supply issuance, which when coupled with the EIP1559 burn, is expected to lead to a degree of ETH supply deflation.
Since the Beacon Chain genesis on 1-Dec-2020, Ethereum has actually had two sources of net supply issuance, the PoW chain, and the PoS chain. In Aug-2021, EIP1559 was implemented, which created a fee burn feature on the PoW chain, a feature which has now moved to the PoS chain.
The chart below is a suite of traces, showing the net daily ETH issuance under various simulated, and actualized conditions. It attempts to model and visualize the daily net change in the ETH supply, in the time since EIP1559 was implemented.
The area chart displays the actual condition, which consists of PoW and PoS issuance, with the EIP1559 burn, and accounts for the deprecation of PoW. Positive values üü¢ represent a net inflationary period (the typical condition), and negative values üî¥ indicate a net supply contraction (ETH supply deflation).
Simulated Continuation of the PoW blockchain üü†,
assumes the PoS Merge never took place and assumes 2 ETH issued per block (uncle rewards ignored for simplicity).
Simulated PoS only chain üîµ
, assumes the Merge took place alongside the EIP1559 release in August 2021, and thus ignores all PoW block rewards after that date. This trace now aligns with the post-Merge area chart.
It can be seen that the PoS model
üîµ
sports a dramatically lower issuance rate of ~772 ETH/day, compared to ~12.5k ETH for the PoW model
üü†
. However, it is noted that net ETH issuance is, at present, still inflationary. This is primarily a result of extremely low blockchain congestion, and low network utilization at the moment.
Live Advanced Chart
Zooming into the 1-hour chart from the Merge event onwards, we can calculate the net supply reduction that has taken place. Between the Merge and the time of writing (~4-days after the fact):
The PoW Ethereum chain would have issued approximately 48.4k ETH on net.
The PoS chain has issued 3,893 ETH on net, reflecting a remarkable 92.8% reduction relative to the deprecated system.
Immediately following the Merge event, a burst of blockspace demand did push average gas fees higher, which created an initial 12-hour period of net ETH supply deflation. However, as congestion cleared, and fees reverted lower, the overall ETH supply has continued to increase, albeit at a dramatically smaller rate compared to the previous PoW implementation.
Live Advanced Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Ethereum Merge was a success, and a historic one to say the least. Many years of dedicated research, development, and strategy have now come together to achieve a remarkable engineering feat.
The world of on-chain analysis now has a plethora of new metrics to explore and describe the new consensus mechanism and performance of the second largest crypto-asset. Of these, the new supply dynamics are of particular interest, as the tension and market forces between new validators coming online (
which increase issuance
), and network congestion fee burn via EIP1559 lean towards either an inflationary, or a deflationary ETH supply.

All That Remains
Initially, we will explore the New Entities Metric, which is a measure of network adoption, and captures a best estimate of the number of new unique entities that transacted on the Bitcoin Network. Here we can see that around 83.5k new entities are coming online per day, which a new macro low for the 2020-22 cycle, but remains higher than the 2018 bear market low, which reached a minimum influx of 66.5k new entities per day.
Live Professional Metric
By comparing the level of average monthly adoption, to the average yearly adoption, we can establish when a macro momentum shift in network adoption is underway.
If Monthly Growth
üü†
> Yearly Growth
üîµ, network adoption can be considered to be expanding and recovering relative to the longer-term baseline (shown in üüß below).
If Monthly Growth
üü†
< Yearly Growth
üîµ, the network adoption can be considered to be contracting and deteriorating relative to the longer-term baseline (shown in üü™ below).
In our present cycle, network growth first entered a contracting regime 533 days ago, with only a brief period of 52-days respite in March-April 2022. The 2018-20 bear market has a few more periods of adoption recovery, notably around the mid-2019 rally to $14k.
Monthly network adoption recently collapsed below the level set following the Great Miner Migration in May-2021. This signifies that an appreciable recovery is not yet underway, and there is a declining influx of new users to the network.
Live Professional Workbench
Next, we can use the Median Transaction Volume metric to reflect the behavior of smaller sized transactions. As explored in the
Market Pulse #3: Understanding Network Participation through Means and Medians
, the Median Transfer Volume represents the ‚Äúmiddle of the pack spend‚Äù, and thus can be used as a proxy to represent the participation of small entities. This can be considered under the following framework.
Increases in the Median Transfer Volume
generally signifies to an increase in retail participation.
Decreases in the Median Transfer Volume
generally signifies a decrease in retail market participation.
A stable Median Transfer Volume
has historically occurred after an expulsion of retail participants, this a indicates stable usage of the remaining network participants (HODLers, career traders, large money).
Currently, the structural decline of the Median Transfer Volume appears to be in the process of gradually flattening out. This softening of trend suggests the market may be entering a phase of relative stability, indicating that the network is close to a full detox of speculative interest, and is approaching an equilibrium baseline of users.
Live Professional Metric
We can further explore this thesis by performing a similar monthly vs yearly check on the Median Transfer Volume. This ratio attempts to capture changes in the momentum of retail participation relative to longer-term trend.
If the Monthly Baseline > Yearly Baseline
it signals an expansion in retail participation.
If the Monthly Baseline < Yearly Baseline
it signals a decline in retail participation.
Following the Great Miner Migration, a period of retail expulsion can be observed üü™ which has been in effect for 426 days. This is a similar duration to the retail investor purge observed during the 2018 bear market, which persisted for 474 days before the monthly average recovered above the yearly average.
Live Professional Workbench
The final metric to inspect network activity is Miner Revenue from Fees. Miner Revenue from Fees is directly related to the level of demand for blockspace and thus network congestion, which has historically been a leading indicator for macro market trend reversal.
A sustained high fee regime
indicates consistent and persistent demand for blockspace, elevated network usage, and suggests a constructive view on demand.
A muted low fee regime
indicates a lack of demand for blockspace, minimal network congestion, and suggests a lacklustre view of network participation.
It is clear that the Bitcoin network remains in an extended muted fee regime, further confirming a recovery in demand is not yet underway. Network activity by and large remains a barren wasteland, with New Entity Adoption falling beneath cycle lows whilst a complete exodus of retail participation is most apparent.

A Full Detox
Next we will explore the volumes of lifespan destroyed in the network, often considers synonymous with tracking the smart old money vs the new and inexperienced money. Lifespan incorporates both the age, and the volume of the coins spent in an attempt to gauge amount of ‚Äústored time‚Äù expended.
The Spent Volume Age Bands metric provides a breakdown of on-chain transfer volumes into age bands to assess whether spending is dominated by old hands losing conviction, or not.
Here we isolate only coins of mature status (6-months+), which displays a clear compression within the current price structure. The dominance of mature coins being spent has collapsed from an exuberant 8% at the height of the bull in Jan 2021, to a distribution of just 0.4% of all volumes.
This suggests that the cohort of investors with older coins remain steadfast, refusing to spend and exit their position at any meaningful scale. Whilst this is constructive in that it displays HODLer conviction, with such a lacklustre demand profile as a backdrop, such an observation may be best interpreted as HODLers bunkering down for the storms ahead.
Live Advanced Metric
This sentiment is echoed by the Realized Capitalization HODL Waves metric which displays the USD Wealth held by individual age bands. With mature spending severely muted, the degree of HODLing behavior is historically high.
In a binary system of just Young and Mature coins, an increase in mature coin wealth held in BTC directly leads to an equivalent decrease in Young coin wealth.
Currently, wealth held by mature coins is at an ATH, due to the dominant investor behavior being a refusal to spend despite exceedingly uncertain global markets. Thus, almost all market activity is being conducted by the same cohort of young coins repeatedly changing hands. As the number of young churning coins incrementally decreases, it can lead to an eventual supply squeeze if and when the market tides turn.
Live Advanced Metric
The 90-day Coin Days Destroyed (CDD-90) metric assesses the total sum of coin day destruction over a 90 day period, helping to visualize periods of higher, and lower coin age expenditure.
CDD-90 has reset to what is effectively an all-time-low (ignoring pre-price history) signifying that older coins are essentially the most dormant they have ever been. This emphasizes the historically significant scale of HODLing which is taking place in the market, and adds weight to the case of extreme HODLing being the dominant investor behavior.
Live Advanced Metric
Revived Supply 1+ Years provides confirmation that the volume of latent supply re-entering the active supply is extremely low. This metric has been statistically normalized to highlight large deviations from the mean spending behavior. This can be considered under the following framework.
Deviations above 2 Sigma
üîµ indicates that a large volume of supply has been revived relative to historic values.
Deviations below 2 Sigma
üü† indicates that the volume of latent supply which is returning to the market is statistically low.
This metric provides confluence with the observations above, where a compression in the spending of long dormant coins is clear, and large upside deviations are occurring less frequently.
Live Professional Workbench
We can also observe a stark contrast between the magnitude of revived supply in a bull market, compared to the prevailing bear.
As prices broke out above the $20k cycle high in 2020
, a flurry of mature aged supply realized profits into market strength. With prices pushed into the $40k region, this +13.5 sigma deviation marked the cyclical maxima, and acted as a warning of potential oversupply. This can be similarly compared to 2018 price action, which recorded a peak deviation of +14 sigma.
As prices collapse back towards $20k in 2022
, the market has responded with an opposite reaction, a sustained period of exceptionally low mature coin spending, and in fact the most quiet since the 2018 bear market lows on a statistical basis.
It is clear that owners that have held their Bitcoin through the volatility of the last year are simply not interested in selling at these price levels, having experienced the full spectrum of volatility and downside that Bitcoin is infamous for. It appears increasingly likely that the Bitcoin HODLers who remain, are strapped in, and willing to go wherever the Bitcoin ship takes them.
Live Professional Workbench
A Short-Term Holders Market
By assessing the structure of coin distribution, separated into both Short-Term and Long-Term Holders, we can ascertain 3 key observations:
Almost all coins acquired above $30k are successfully migrating into Long-Term Holder status üîµ which are
statistically unlikely to be spent in the face of further volatility
.
The majority of coin churn is apparent around the current market price with the Short-Term Holders üî¥ jostling for the best entry price. This reflects both a recent capitulation, and an equal an opposite influx of demand within the current consolidation price range.
A large supply airgap is apparent below $18k until the $11-12k range. Trading below the current cycle low would put an extraordinary volume of Short-Term Holder coins into a deep unrealized loss, which may exacerbate downside reflexivity, and trigger yet another wide ranging capitulation event.
The Long-Term Holder cohort appear relatively unfazed by the price action of 2022, and their supply price distribution remains constructive. In contrast, the Short-Term Holder cohort are responsible for the majority coin movement, with a heavy concentration around the current market price. Thus, it is the STH cohort which is of the most of interest from here.
Live Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room
We shall initially assess their profitability across cycles, to better understand typical spending behaviors. This structure can be considered in the following three phases.
Phase 1: Collapse
üî¥: This occurs after cycle tops as a rapid collapse in price actions sends the STH cohort into deep loss.
Phase 2: Compression
üü° : ¬†As prices collapse lower, STH profitability also compresses. Eventually a point is reached STH coins are clustered around spot prices, and thus their cost basis is in-phase with the market.
Phase 3: Expansion
üü¢: With the STH cost basis now close the market price, any meaningful market rally puts large swathes of STH coins into an unrealized profit, triggering easier psychological conditions to HODL through.
STH profitability remains deep within phase 2 and has been here for 431 days, which is the longest duration out of any bear market cycle to date.
Live Professional Metric
To further isolate STH behavior, we introduce a new variant of the Market Realized Gradient Oscillator specifically related to STHs (the STH-MRGO). This is a statistically normalized oscillator, designed to measure relative changes in momentum between speculative value, and true organic capital inflows for the STH cohort. Again, three distinct phases can be identified:
Expansion
üü¢:An expansion in momentum as speculative capital outpaces organic STH inflows, leading to prices climbing rapidly.
Collapse
üî¥: As prices reach unsustainable heights, a collapse in price action becomes inevitable, leading to an initial wash-out of the STH cohort.
Transition Period
üü†: The momentum of price action and STH capital flows establish an in-phase equilibrium with price, as sellers become exhausted, and STH coins concentrate at what ¬†becomes the eventual price range of the bear market bottom.
Based on the two charts above, it appears as though the STH cohort is approaching an equilibrium, which historically occurs in the latest stages of a bear market. The principle risk is that this large concentration of STH coins around the current price, becomes yet another dam to break, requiring a new equilibrium to be established.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
Network activity remains in a dire condition as network adoption levels slump to levels last seen during the COVID crisis. However, one constructive observation would be the expulsion of retail participants from the network leaving just the HODLers class, career traders and everyday Bitcoin users remaining. This suggests the user-base is at its foundational level.
The HODLer class remain resolute with both mature coin USD wealth reaching ATHs, and a multitude of lifespan metrics fully resetting to historical lows, emphasizing the unwillingness to spend held coins. This suggests the majority of current market churn is associated with the Short-Term Holder class.
The Short-Term Holders find themselves at an equilibrium period where speculative market flows, and the STH cost basis are in-phase. With such a large concentration of supply in the current consolidation range, a risk remains of a levee break, should prices lose the June $17.5k lows.

2022,40,2022-W40,2022-10-03,2022-10-09,Bullish,19633.46,19443.47,19785.97,-0.97,Disagree,"Global equity and bond markets continue to tread challenging ground, with growing evidence of stress developing in sovereign debt and currency markets this week. Of particular note was the dislocation experienced in the United Kingdom Gilt market, where bond yields soared, the British pound fell to all-time-lows against the US Dollar, and the Bank of England reestablished quantitative easing to reliquify markets.
Amidst such extremes, Bitcoin prices have remained notably stable, consolidating within an increasingly narrow range between $19,921 and $20,239. Such quiet periods are very uncommon for Bitcoin, with semblance to both pre-crash November 2018, but equally to pre-rally March 2019.
Despite severe price drawdowns, and global macro turmoil, Bitcoin hashrate has remarkably pushed to yet another all-time high this week. We last covered the stress developing in the Bitcoin Mining sector back in June (see
WoC 23
, and
WoC 25
). This week, we will revisit with a deep dive into the production side of Bitcoin, which appears to be recovering remarkably well, a signal which has historically been constructive in the months that followed.

Mining Competition Increases
As the bear market rages on, Bitcoin hashrate has reached a new all-time-high of 242 Exahash per second. To give an analogy for scale, this is equivalent to all 7.753 Billion people on earth, each completing a SHA-256 hash calculation approximately 30 Billion times every second. These are extraordinarily large numbers.
Live Chart
The Bitcoin hash-ribbons commenced an unwind in late August, providing an indication that mining conditions were improving, and hashrate was coming back online. Interestingly, the current environment has not yet seen prices recover, signalling this hashrate rise is due to more efficient mining hardware coming online and/or miners with superior balance sheets having a larger share of the hashpower network.
Almost all historical hash-ribbon unwinds have preceded greener pastures in the months that followed.
Live Advanced Chart
The Mining Pulse provides another tool to monitor miner activity, measuring the average block interval relative to the target of 600-seconds.
Lower values
indicate blocks are faster than 600-sec, signalling hashrate is growing faster than the regulating difficulty adjustment can keep up.
Higher values
indicate blocks are slower than 600-sec, signalling hashrate is coming offline, often in response to industry shocks such as capitulation events.
As shown in blue, the recent miner capitulation has been a multi-month affair, starting in late May and with recovery starting in early August. As shown in pink, previous bear markets have typically ended with more of a dramatic event, with severe and rapid declines in hashrate.
It remains to be seen if this is more subdued but protracted capitulation event is simply the appetiser, or whether it reflects a new dynamic as more of the hashpower is held by better capitalised publicly traded mining companies.

New Product Updates:
September
September was an extremely exciting month for Glassnode, engaging our entire team, from engineering, data scientists, and analysts, to deploy a brand new suite of Ethereum Merge and Proof-of-Stake metrics. We released
8x Analysis Reports, 16x Metrics, 19x Workbench Constructions, and 2x Dashboards.
Read our Product Updates for September
The Price of Production
As hashrate comes back online, Mining Difficulty has recommenced a series of upwards adjustments, having risen 27.9% since the Great Miner Migration peak in May 2021.
Higher protocol Difficulty implies an increasing cost of production per unit of BTC as more hashpower competition enters the network. This is occurring at a time where miner revenues are already stressed due to lower coin prices, which should, in theory, create elevated income stress on the mining industry.
Live Chart
Indeed, we can see that the revenue earned per Exahash has been in a persistent and long-term downtrend, with the BTC-denominated reward currently at an all-time-low of 4.06 BTC per EH per day.
On a USD-denominated basis, this equates to between $78k to $88k in revenue per EH per day. This has returned to Oct-2020 levels, which was after the 2020 halving event, and where BTC prices were around $10k (currently ~$20k). From this, we can see that a 66% increase in Difficulty and Hashrate since Oct-2020 corresponds to an approximate halving in revenue per hash.
Live Advanced Workbench
Numerous models have been proposed to evaluate, and estimate the network wide cost of production for BTC, many of which consider Difficulty as an essential input parameter. Difficulty effectively represents a protocol defined measure of the all-in-hurdle-rate in order to solve the next block, and win the reward.
The Difficulty Regression model is a fairly simple interpretation of this, calculated as a log-log regression between Difficulty and Market Cap, sporting an exceptionally high R2 coefficient of 0.944. This model last intersected spot prices around $17,840, at the lows of the June 2022 sell-off. It is currently hovering around $18,300, which is just below this weeks market lows.
This would indicate that miners are somewhat on the cusp of acute income stress.
Live Workbench
A brand new valuation framework was proposed by analyst
kuntah
this week, which fits a non linear relationship between the cost of production, and the input parameters of Difficulty, and Issuance. The model seeks to capture the point of maximum miner efficiency, being at the bottom of bear markets when only the strongest miner balance sheets and operations are profitable.
Three traces are shown:
üî¥ Current Estimate Cost of Production of $12,140, located around the centroid of the last cycles trading history, and the genesis of the 2020-21 bull run. Note that this reflects a price floor model, fitted to the lows of bear market capitulations.
üü£ Post 2024 Halving Cost of Production $24,230 (assuming constant difficulty).
üü† Geometric mean of the two aforementioned traces $17,080, providing a gauge of the most likely price of acute miner income stress.
Similar to the Difficulty Regression Model, the price range between $17k and $18k has confluence as being an area that induced miner stress in June, and aligns with numerous cost of production estimates.
Live Advanced Workbench
Has Miner Capitulation Risk Passed?
Having established price areas of interest relating to miner profitability and income stress, we can review a series of metrics which help describe these events.
First, the Puell Multiple, which is a cyclical oscillator that compares the current daily mining revenue to their yearly average. The Puell Multiple hit the current lows of around 0.33 in June, indicating that miners were earning just 33% of their yearly average revenue. It has since recovered to around 0.63, implying a degree of stress relief, and adjustment to this new pricing regime.
All previous bear cycles have experienced a strong rally off the lows in the Puell Multiple, associated with short-term price relief once a true bear market low is established.
Live Advanced Chart
The Puell Multiple and cost of production models are
implied stress models
, where we estimate prices where miner revenues may come under pressure (thus necessitating additional coin distribution). We can bolster this case by using
explicit stress models
such as the Hash ribbons, or the Difficulty Ribbon Compression, which react only to the observable changes in the hashpower markets.
The model below combines the implied income stress of the Puell Multiple, with the explict stress observation of the Difficulty Ribbon Compression. As of the time of writing, this model has only just exited levels where miner capitulation is statistically likely.
However, note that in all previous bear markets, there are a handful of days where this happens fleetingly. Thus full confirmation is yet to be established, but is one to watch for a more sustained recovery.
Live Advanced Workbench
If we look at the aggregate size of miner balances, we can see that around 78.4k BTC remain held by miners we have labelled (accounting for ~96% of current hashrate). The cohort of 'Other' unlabelled miners is much larger at around 660k BTC, however this includes accumulated (and likely lost coins) from miners from the early years of Bitcoin.
This provides a gauge of the risk, with some 78.4k BTC held by miners who may come under income stress.
Live Professional Workbench
To finalise our assessment, we look to the actual coin distribution patterns of miners to see impacts on their treasury balances. The chart below is the 30-day change in miner wallets, and whilst distribution has slowed, it remains at a level of around 4.5k BTC per month. This is a decline of 50% since the peak in early September, however.
Live Professional Chart
However, digging further into this, we can identify that a great majority of current expenditure is sourced from miners associated with Poolin. The orange curve below shows the all-miner 30-day change, whilst the blue curve is specific to Poolin, demonstrating that almost all spending is associated with this cohort.
Live Professional Workbench
Poolin was, until very recently, one of the largest mining pools in the industry, accounting for over 15% of hashrate in early 2020, and 12% at the start of September. After an
announcement that Poolin was experiencing 'liquidity issues'
, the estimated hashrate directed at the pool plummeted, representing just 3.7% of the hashpower network today.
In a
Market Pulse report
released at the time, we demonstrated how to use Glassnode tools to estimate the hashrate of a specific mining pool. The methodology uses their share of block reward revenue relative to the total as a proxy, enabling us to visualise just how quickly miners can redirect hashrate in times of distress.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Amidst global chaos in traditional markets, Bitcoin prices remain remarkably stable, in a multi-month consolidation between $18k and $20k. It is extremely rare for BTC prices to stay so stationary for long, suggesting heightened probabilities of volatility on the horizon.
Bitcoin mining hashrate reached new all-time-highs this week, driving up the cost of production for BTC, at a time where miner revenues have only just recovered from the recent capitulation. By numerous models, we estimate that the average cost of BTC production hovers just below current prices, such that any significant price decline could turn an implied income stress, into acute and explicit stress.
This risk could manifest as a second stage miner capitulation, with around 78.4k BTC still held in miner treasuries. It is extremely unlikely this full amount would be distributed, however provides an upper bound gauge on the potential risks at hand.

Against this backdrop, Bitcoin has been remarkably stable and has gained ground against many assets on a relative scale.
Bitcoin markets traded slightly higher this week, rallying from a low of $19,037 to a high of $20,406. Prices remain rangebound, consolidating for over 120 days since the major deleveraging event in mid-June.
As investors attempt to establish a bear market floor, we can compare the market structure to past cycle lows. In this edition, we undertake a series of studies assessing the behavior of Whale sized entities, and make adjustments to many bottom formation metrics, to better account for the influence of lost and long HODLed coins.

A Fragile Equilibrium
Generally, a sustained price momentum can often be associated with a supporting trend in net on-chain accumulation, or distribution. This correlation is often most heavily driven by larger entities‚Äô behavior (i.e. High net worth Individuals, Whales, and institutional capital).
The significance of large entities can be gauged by their share of the total circulating supply. As the
Relative Address Supply Distribution
chart shows, bigger addresses (holding >100 BTC) has gradually declined from 70%, to 60% share in of the total supply since early 2011 (although note that the coin value has changed significantly over this time).
Live Professional Chart
The
Accumulation Trend Score
reflects the aggregated balance change intensity of active investors over the past 30 days, where a higher weight is assigned to larger entities. Approaching value of 1 indicates that, on aggregate, larger entities (or a large sub-set of the network) are adding meaningful volumes to their onchain balance (and vice versa for values close to 0).
Reviewing values during the later stages of the 2018-2019 bear market, a series of distinctive intervals can be identified:
Pre-Capitulation Equilibrium
: While the spot price converges towards the long-lasting cycle baseline (dash line), the supply and demand sides remain in
Equilibrium
üî≤.
Capitulation:
With price action breaking below the cycle baseline, the market enters a capitulation phase. Interestingly, the larger entities tend to intensify their
Accumulation
üü¢. These strong-accumulation intervals are usually followed by an
Equilibrium
üî≤ period.
Bottom Discovery:
Throughout the bottom formation stage, due to the lack of demand, there are one or more incidents that a short-term rally is met with large entities
Distribution
üî¥ (known as
Bear Market Rally
).
Remarkably, after breaking the current cycle baseline at $30K, a series of consecutive events similar to the 2018-2019 bear market has taken place. Throughout the capitulation in early 2022, the
Accumulation Trend Score
indicates significant accumulation by large entities has taken place, as well as the seizure of the recent bear market rally to $24.5k for exit liquidity. At present, this metric suggests an equilibrium (neutral) structure in the market, which remains similar to early 2019.
Live Advanced Chart
To conduct a more detailed analysis, the
Accumulation Trend Score by Cohort
can be consulted. Here we compare the market structure to the post-capitulation stage of the 2018-2019 bear market.
We can see that large entities, particularly 1k-10k BTC wallets, contributed to a distribution event üü• during a rally off the lows in March 2019, and entered a period of equilibrium afterwards. Small retail-level participants (< 1 BTC) maintained heavy accumulation üü¶ throughout 2018 and 2019.
Live Engine Room Chart
In our current market structure, and noting an approximate 10x in BTC prices, we can see very similar behavior occurring in large entities, however driven more so by the 100-1k BTC cohort during the August rally.
In addition to the relative neutrality across small to medium-address cohorts, the Accumulation Trend Score for whales holding 1k-10k BTC highlights aggressive accumulation since late September. Whales owning >10K BTC are biased towards weak distribution over recent months.
Live Engine Room Chart
We can see increased net whale withdrawal volumes in recent weeks, with a net outflow from exchanges hitting 15.7k BTC, which is the largest since June 2022.
Live Professional Chart
We can calculate the cost basis for all whales who have been actively speculating over a chosen time period, can deliver a threshold level that is psychologically important to these investors. By price stamping the deposits and withdrawal volumes of the whale cohort (1k+ BTC) to/from exchanges, we can estimate the average price of Whale Deposits/Withdrawals since Jan-2017. This Whale cost basis is currently around $15.8k.

Declining Profit and Rising Pain
As we discussed in
Week 25
, tracking the diminishing supply in profit is a powerful technique to identify points of elevated financial stress, which have exhausted sellers in previous cycles.
Surveying the
Percent Supply in Profit
during the bottom formation stages of prior bear markets shows that cyclical lows have generally occurred alongside supply profitability of 40%-42%. Currently, 50% of the circulating supply is in an unrealized profit, suggesting that supply profitability remains elevated in relation to historical analogues. This insinuates a full detox in profitability may not have occurred yet.
Live Advanced Chart
Moreover, the rising trend of cyclical lows in the Percent Supply in Profit graph has been a prominent pattern since the 2014-2015 bear market. A key driver of this macro trend is the impact of lost coins, and inactive supply (including the Patoshi coins). To investigate the effect of these coins, the chart below illustrates the total
Supply in Profit
alongside the
Supply Last Active +7 Years Ago,
which can be presumed lost or inactive.
Currently, 3.7M bitcoins have been inactive over the past +7 years, which is equal to 34% of the current Supply in Profit.
Live Advanced Chart
By adjusting the Supply in Profit üü† with this inactive supply, we can calculate the Adjusted-Percent of Supply in Profit üîµ. The resulting chart shows that at the lowest point of bear cycles tends to drop to around 39%, however with a similar conclusion; it has been worse in prior cycles.
Live Advanced Workbench
The intensity of implied financial strain on the remaining investors can be traced by the
Relative Unrealized Profit
metric. This indicator measures the normalized total profit of all coins in the supply, which adjusts for an increase in capital flows into the Bitcoin asset each cycle.
An investigation of historical data shows that when aggregated Unrealized Profit compresses to ~30% of the Market Cap, a large proportion of the selling pressure has been alleviated (seller exhaustion). The price depreciation since November 2021 has caused this ratio to sink to 0.37, reflecting a meaningful, but not as painful outcome as prior lows.
Live Advanced Chart
The
Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)
is a metric which maps out the difference between unrealized profit and loss of the network as a proportion of the market cap.
NUPL
takes into account both the loss and profit held in the supply through various phases of a market cycle.
Since early June,
NUPL
has dropped into a compressed negative range of 0% to -15% on two separate events, lasting a total of 88 days so far. From a comparative perspective,
NUPL
has traded down to levels lower than -25% in prior cycles, and remained negative for between 134-days (2018-19) and 301-days (2014-15).
Note that
NUPL
cycle lows have also gradually climbed as a result of both lost and long HODLed coins.
Live Advanced Chart
Next, we can apply the same methodology utilized to adjust the Percent of Supply in Profit for the NUPL metric. This corrects for any contribution from inactive supply producing the
Adjusted-Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (aNUPL)
üîµ.
The key observation from this modification is that by removing the impact of >7 years old coin (inactive supply),
aNUPL
has has been trading below zero for the last 119 days which is comparable with the time length of prior bear markets‚Äô bottom formation phase.
Also, the lowest value recorded for
aNUPL
(-39%) in the current bear market has dropped below the -25% threshold level, which indicates the severity of the ongoing undervalued market structure.
Live Advanced Workbench
Distribution of Pain and Gain
After evaluating the intensity of financial stress across the network, we can examine its distribution of across both
Long-Term (LTH) and Short-Term
Holders (STH)
. This analysis aims to identify equivalent market structure patterns during the bear market.
Looking at
Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss
, there are many instances where price corrections paused as the entire (>99%) of short-term holders‚Äô supply fell into loss üîµ. At the moment, 18.1% of the total supply is in possession of STH, with 15.1% held at an unrealized loss. This leaves just 3% of supply held by STHs and in profit, which after such a prolonged downtrend, is likely approaching a degree of seller exhaustion.
Live Professional Chart
Studying the Long-Term Supply in Loss metric suggests that at points where LTH Supply in Loss surpasses 20% of the total supply üî¥, the probability of capitulation amongst these investors reaches a peak.
With over 31% of the supply now held by LTHs in loss üü•, it is increasingly likely the market has passed this stage, which also suggests a similar condition to prior bottoming formations. The market has been in this phase for 1.5 months, with a previous cycle duration ranging from 6 to 10 months.
Live Professional Workbench
Finally, we can compare the average acquisition price per coin for the STH cohort üî¥ against the LTH cohort üîµ, to approximate the relative stress levels. As discussed in WoC 37, the continuous price depreciation during a prolonged bear market leads the STH Realized Price to fall below the LTH Realized Price üü™.
This market structure denotes periods where the average cost of acquisition over the past 155 days, is now lower than the average LTH-cost basis. In other words, those who are just entering have a better cost basis than those who have weathered months of volatility.
This is a direct outcome of LTH capitulation, where coins purchased near the cycle top are sold and change hands at much lower prices.
Two weeks ago, the market entered into this stage and compared to prior bears, has taken between 145-days and 339-days to recover. With the LTH cost basis at $23.3k, and STHs at $22.1k, this sets a key price zone to expect resistance at first, but potentially greener pastures if prices trade higher, and stay higher.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin prices have shown remarkable relative strength of late, amidst a highly volatile traditional market backdrop. Several macro metrics indicate that Bitcoin investors are establishing what could be a bear market floor, with numerous similarities to previous cycle lows.
Network profitability has not quite hit the same level of severe financial pain as past cycles, however adjustment for lost and long HODLed coins can explain a reasonable portion of this divergence.
In many ways, many on-chain metrics, market structure, and investor behavior patterns are dotting of the i's, and crossing the t's for a textbook bear market floor. A principle piece which is missing is duration, of which history would suggest there may be several months still ahead before a full recovery.

Volatility is Imminent
It is very uncommon for BTC markets to reach periods of such low realized volatility, with almost all prior instances preceding a highly volatile move. Historical examples with 1-week rolling volatility below the current value of 28% in a bear market have preceded significant price moves in both directions üü¶.
Live Advanced Workbench
A similar compression can be seen within the
aSOPR
metric which measures an average realized profit/loss multiple for spent coins on any given day.
aSOPR of 1.0 in a bullish trend
often acts as support, as market participants tend to increase their position at their cost basis, manifesting as buying the dip.
aSOPR of 1.0 in a bearish trend
often acts as resistance, as investors seek exit liquidity around their cost basis, with investors seeking any available exit liquidity.
A large divergence is currently forming between price action, and the aSOPR metric. As prices trade sideways or decline, the magnitude of losses that being locked in are diminishing, indicating an exhaustion of sellers within the current price range.
As the weekly average of aSOPR approaches the break-even value of 1.0 from below, it is increasingly likely that volatility is on the horizon, either as a breakout, or yet another rejection.

Live Advanced Chart
Inspecting the aSOPR metric by constituent investor cohorts, we can isolate the contribution of the Short-Term (STHs) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs). We will start with the STH class, where we can identify two similar cases in history:
The 2015-2016 Bear Market
üü¢ experienced a divergence between price and STH-SOPR. This divergence was confirmed with a STH-SOPR breakout above 1.0, followed by several supportive retests of the level. This indicates a psychological switch from securing exit liquidity, to buying the dip near the cohort cost basis.
The 2018-2019 Bear Market
üî¥ also experienced a divergence between price action and spent profitability, however, this culminated as a rejection from the break-even level as participants overwhelmed demand, and sought exit liquidity at their cost basis.
Currently, STH-SOPR is approaching a break-even threshold once again, with the most recent attempt in August failing to sustain a break higher.

STH-SOPR
(7D-SMA)
breaking
above
1.0
could
signal
a

,
and is an early

.
Live Professional Chart
By comparing the monthly spending patterns of the STH cohort to their yearly baseline, we can establish whether a macro momentum shift in profitability regime is occurring.
Where Monthly Growth
> Yearly Growth
üü¢ STHs are realizing more profits of late, which increases the probability of a constructive reversal.
Where Monthly Growth
< Yearly Growth
üî¥ STHs are realizing more losses of late, indicating that seller exhaustion has not been reached, and increases the probability of a STH-SOPR rejection at breakeven.
The STH-SOPR multiple is attempting its fifth breakout of this bear cycle, battling for a shift in momentum. Each prior attempt was met with rejection, and a subsequent decline in prices. However, the severity of drawdowns in the STH-SOPR multiple are diminishing with time, reflecting increasing likelihood that seller exhaustion is occurring.
Live Professional Workbench
Conversely, Long-Term Holder spent profitability continues to languish at historical lows, with this investor cohort locking in losses of around -48% on average. With price remaining remarkably stable of late, it is evident that the main transactors from the Long-Term Holder cohort are those from the 2021-2022 cycle, who continue to capitulate their positions at a loss.
These periods of extreme LTH profitability stress generally occur towards the depths of the bear market with only 3.3% üü£ of trading days incurring higher losses.
üîî
Alert Idea
:
LTH-SOPR
(7D-SMA)
breaking below 0.50 could indicate a further flush out of the LTH cohort, with less than 3% of trading days seeing larger average LTH losses.
Live Professional Chart
Off-Chain Volatility Brews
In the off-chain domain, volatility is also brewing in the derivatives markets. Options pricing of short-term implied volatility (IV) has reached an all-time-low of 48% this week. Several prior instances of such low IV has preceded violent moves, often compounded by the de-leveraging of derivatives and DeFi markets.

Trading volumes in futures markets have also declined to multi-year lows of $24B per day. This returns to levels last seen in December 2020, before the bull cycle had broken through the 2017 cycle $20k ATH. This may signal a lower liquidity trading environment should the market find momentum in either direction.
Live Advanced Chart
We have also seen an aggressive, and consistent increase in Futures Open Interest since the collapse of the LUNA-UST project. BTC denominated futures Open Interest has reached a new ATH of 633k BTC, which is an 80% increase since May this year.
This suggests that levels of speculation, and/or hedging positions are increasing, despite coin prices declining significantly over this time.
Live Advanced Chart
Thereafter, we can assess the Futures Estimated Leverage Ratio to investigate the relative scale of open contracts compared to the balance of BTC reserves held across all major exchanges. We can similarly observe the remarkable growth in futures open interest relative to the BTC balance on exchanges.
This provides another indication that a somewhat low liquidity environment is in play, and could result in an elevated impact on spot markets should some of this leverage unwind.
Live Advanced Chart
Another metric we can use to assess the health of futures markets is the proportion of positions using Crypto or Cash as margin.
Crypto-margined collateral
such as BTC or ETH is inherently more volatile, as fluctuations in the value of underlying collateral can amplify deleveraging events.
Cash-margined collateral
such fiat or stablecoins effectively hold 1-1 with the dollar, and do not fluctuate in value alongside the open futures position.
Using this framework, we can observe the evolution of market preference over time:
The peak dominance of Crypto-Margined collateral reached 70%, and marked the height of exuberance in April 2021. This was followed by a
major decline in digital asset prices
.
A regime switch occurred after the May 2021 sell-off, with Cash-margined collateral becoming the dominant choice, causing crypto-margin dominance to fall to 35% today.
Cash-margined collateral dominance reached an ATH this week, indicating that the vast majority of the new open interest, are cash margined positions. As such, the health of the derivative collateral structure has vastly improved over the last 18-months. This acts to reduce the probability of an amplified liquidation cascade, whilst also demonstrating the growing market demand for stablecoin collateral.
Live Professional Workbench
During the exuberant speculation seen around Feb to Apr 2021, the futures cash-and-carry trade was yielding between +45%/yr and +100%/yr for rolling 3-month contracts, and perpetual futures, respectively.
This has declined dramatically ever since the May 2021 sell-off, with both the the rolling 3-month basis (0.55%/yr) and perpetual funding rates (1.97%/yr) now trading at negligible yields, especially relative to prevailing rates for many sovereign bonds. Both annualized funding rates and annualized rolling basis also briefly entered backwardation in late August.
Despite challenging price conditions, and a persistent increase in futures open interest, there remains no notable directional bias within the current futures positioning. This increases the chances that much of this leverage is may be utilized for the hedging of risk, rather than directional speculation.
Live Advanced Workbench
Following this, we can assess the total Long and Short liquidations as a percentage of total Open Interest across all futures contracts. This provides insight into the proportion of open interest cleared via liquidations, rather than discretionary position closes.
Total liquidations are now historically low, hitting just 0.1% of total open interest, which is somewhat counter-intuitive given the marked increase in futures positions and leverage. Long positions üü¢ remain the dominant liquidated position, however only by a small margin, with 54% of liquidations being longs this week.
Live Advanced Workbench
Overall, this set of derivatives market observations likely suggests a more sophisticated set of risk hedging positions are prevalent in the current market. These positions likely treat Bitcoin as a high beta asset in both the instance of severe drawdown, or in the case of a volatile break higher, and are thus less sensitive to directional pricing.
This is based on the persistent decline in crypto-margin dominance, near uninterrupted increase in open interest as prices fall, but accompanied by historically low liquidation volumes, and almost no directional bias in cash-and-carry yields. We can also note that almost the exact opposite set of conditions was prevalent at the April 2021 ATH, which we have argued was the true end of the 2021 Bitcoin bull market.
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market is primed for volatility, with both realized and options implied volatility falling to historical lows. On-chain spending behavior is compressing into a decision point, where spot prices intersect with the Short-Term Holder cost basis.
Previous instances where this set of conditions was prevalent have preceded violent price moves, with examples in previous bear cycles being in both directions. There remains little discernible directional bias in futures markets, despite open interest pushing to new ATHs.
Volatility is likely on the horizon, and Bitcoin prices are not known to sit still for very long.

, periods of extremely low volatility for Bitcoin are very rare, and there are historical examples that have broken both higher, and lower, with extreme force. ¬†Thus, in this weeks edition, we will lay out both a Bull and Bear case from a primarily on-chain perspective, covering the following topics:
On-chain activity and utilization of the network remains persistently weak, suggesting lacklustre network effect expansion.
Miners are on the cusp of severe stress, with some 78.2k BTC held in treasuries at risk.
Exchange BTC balances continue to drain, whilst an excess of $3B/month in stablecoin buying power is flowing in.
The HODLer cohort have reached all-time-high coin ownership, and steadfastly refuse to release coins back into the market.

üêª A Case for the Bears
There is Nobody Home
On-chain activity is a powerful suite of tools for measuring and modelling network utilization. The simple interpretation framework is that network effects are constructive, and thus a sustained and positive momentum in Bitcoin user activity is likely constructive for the asset.
The chart below assesses the momentum of new on-chain addresses, comparing the short-term (monthly üî¥) vs long-term (yearly üîµ) moving average. As can be seen in Nov 2018, a failure of the monthly average to attain positive momentum was a precursor to a sell-off from $6k to $3.2k. Conversely, Jan 2019 represented a burst of new activity which propelled markets from $4k to $14k.
New Address Momentum is on the cusp of yet another push higher, but is yet to show a convincing 2019 burst of strength. With a slight curl over in recent weeks, this suggests a lacklustre inflow of new demand at present.

The growth rate of addresses with a non-zero balance has also stagnated since August, which is also similar to the November 2018 period. This indicates that despite there being some 400k New Addresses per day, there are as many which are being emptied of their entire balance.

Transfer volume (USD) has also collapsed towards this cycle lows, falling to $19.2B/day. This is now below the transfer volume peak seen back in December 2017, and is only marginally higher than the lows in May to July 2021.
This indicates a significant degree of apathy exists within the Bitcoin network, with extremely muted on-chain activity suggesting a lacklustre read on network utilization, attention and user base growth.
It is very quiet on-chain.

Of note however, is a recent character change observable in the mempool. The volume of coins transferred in transactions hitting our nodes mempool has seen a sustained burst higher since September.
Live Advanced Chart
The same can be seen in the number of transactions sent, with a very modest increase in the average fee rate paid. Whilst very early, and short-term in nature, this aligns with New Address Momentum approaching the yearly average.
These metrics provide a potential view of a changing tide, albeit require an uptrend to be established and sustained to increase the odds of a true market recovery. In the instance these turn out to be simply fleeting events, the macro negative trends described above are more likely to prevail.

Miners on the Cusp of Chaos
The mining industry has been in the spotlight of late, with hashrate and difficulty pushing to new all-time-highs (
covered in WoC 40
). This acts to increase the cost of BTC production, despite miner revenues per hash falling to all-time lows.
The Difficulty Regression Model is an estimated all-in-average cost of production, and is coincident with the spot price of $19.3k at the time of writing. A bearish cross-over was last seen in mid-2018, with a major mining industry capitulation following soon after, and persisting for several months.
Live Advanced Chart
Indeed, the mining Hash Price has reached all-time-lows this week, with miners earning just $66.5k/day per Exahash applied. With Hash Price now falling below the post 2020 halving lows, despite coin prices being ~2x, this demonstrates just how extreme the recent increase in hashrate competition has become.
Live Advanced Chart
In order to quantify the risk of miners distributing their treasuries, we need to first consult a metric which demonstrates our label coverage of Bitcoin miners. Here we use the Miner Block Subsidy as a proxy measurement of hashrate. The assumption is that any labelled miner who earns 10% of the block subsidy, won 10% of the blocks, and thus likely has 10% of the hashrate.
In the post March 2020 era, our labelled miners üî¥ cover upwards of 95% of the network hashpower (especially since the May 2021 Great Migration out of China). Unknown miners labelled as 'Other' üü° account for the remaining < 5%.
Thus, we can reasonably consider the balance held by all miners excluding Patoshi and 'Other', to provide a gauge on the coin volume at risk in miner treasuries.
Live Advanced Chart
The chart below shows that miner balances have increased by 10x since 2019, with a total of 78.2k BTC held today. This is worth $1.509B at a price of $19.3k, which is a non-trivial overhang for an increasingly distressed industry.
Of this, the vast majority is held by miners associated with BinancePool, Poolin, Lubian, and F2Pool. All have seen a stagnation of their balance in 2022, suggesting that prices below $40k have imposed income stress, and motivated a behavioural shift.
Live Professional Chart
Overall, the Bitcoin demand side, as measured by on-chain activity and network participation, is lacklustre to say the least. There are some green shoots of hope in the mempool, however there remains a $1.5B overhang of coins held by the mining cohort, whom are in extremely distressed territory.
A deleveraging event of miners may lead to distribution into thin orderbooks (
WoC 42
), historically light demand, and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and liquidity constraints.
üêÇ A Case for the Bulls
Exchanges Drain
Despite fairly unimpressive on-chain utilization profile, the net impact of the transactions which are taking place maintain a constructive undertone.
October has seen a marked shift in balance change behaviour by most wallet cohorts. Cohorts from Shrimp (< 1BTC) through to Whales (up to 10k BTC) have altered their behaviour from one of net balance decline and distribution üü•, and towards one of net accumulation and balance increase üü¶.
Given prices have remained flat and of low volatility, this suggests a tendency towards patient accumulation at range lows.
Live Professional Chart (Glassnode Engine Room)
This can be visualized in the URPD chart, broken into Short-Term Holders (STHs, üî¥) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs, üîµ). We can see that the volume of coins changing hands to new recent buyers (STHs) increases notably at prices between $18k and $20k, reinforcing the observations above.
A significant 'air-gap' exists between $12k and $18k, where very little coin volume has transacted, and thus price discovery to the downside could be highly volatile in the event the bulls fail to hold the line.
Also apparent is a very large distribution of coins held by LTHs at prices well above $30k. As we have covered in prior editions (
WoC 39
), these Bitcoin holders are the least price sensitive, and at this stage, could be argued to be at peace with their held unrealized losses.
Live Professional Chart (Glassnode Engine Room)
The reserves held on exchanges have also continued their relentless decline, dropping to multi-year lows throughout October, and retracing back to Jan 2018 levels. In effect, all coin volume which flowed into exchanges since the last cycle high, has now been withdrawn into a non-exchange associated wallet.
October alone saw 123.5k BTC withdrawn, equivalent to 0.86% of the circulating supply. Whilst exchange reserves alone are not a signal unto themselves, within the context provided above and below, it provides a constructive backdrop.
Live Advanced Chart
Coinbase has seen a very large scale net withdrawal of -41.6k BTC this week, bringing the total decline from the post-March 2020 balance peak to -48.4%. It is important to note that these outflows are based on our best estimate wallet clusters, and appear to be a combination of coins flowing into both investor wallets, and/or institutional grade custody solutions.
At the very least these wallets have not intersected with any other exchange related wallets, and thus are highly likely to reflect a changing of hands.
Live Advanced Chart
Another observation associated with exchanges is the balance between the 30-day net flows of the two major assets, BTC and ETH, compared to the combined 30-day net flow of the four largest stablecoins USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI.
This metric consists of two components:
The barcode will return üü† when the flow of BTC and ETH ¬†into exchanges is positive (i.e. net USD denominated inflows of the two major assets).
The net position change will return üü¢ when the flow of stablecoins into exchanges is larger than the USD value of BTC and ETH (positive buying power), and conversely will return üî¥ when more BTC and ETH value has flowed in than stablecoins (negative buying power).
At the moment, we can see that the 30-day netflow of BTC and ETH has been withdrawals, and simultaneously, an excess of $3B/month in stablecoins have flowed into exchanges, increasing relative buying power.
USD reserves are increasing, whilst coin available to buy is declining.
Live Advanced Chart
HODLers HODL On
With the on-net flows through exchanges appearing to have a bullish lean towards appreciable accumulation, we can then assess whether there is any loss of conviction amongst existing longer-term holders.
The total USD wealth held in BTC, valued at the time of each coins last transaction, is now disproportionately skewed to longer-term holders. The proportion of wealth held in coins that moved in the last 3-months is now at an all-time-low. The reciprocal observation is that wealth held by coins older than 3-months (increasingly held by HODLers) is now at an all-time-high.
Live Advanced Chart
This is further validated by the Binary Liveliness metric, where we can draw two key observations:
The steepness of the Liveliness decline is accelerating
, indicating the market is very heavily aligned with HODLing style behaviour. Old hands are simply not spending.
The Binary Liveliness oscillator
, which compares recent steepness vs a rolling 30-day baseline,
is at extreme lows
. Such events are coincident with extreme HODLing behaviour, usually seen during early-mid stage bear market accumulation (the grind), and immediately prior to bullish reversals (a supply squeeze).
Live Advanced Chart
To close, we can confirm the above observations have a bullish bias by observing the trend and magnitude of long-term holder supply. Here we have two traces shown:
üü£ Shows the actual trace of LTH-Supply, which is now at an all-time-high of 13.82M BTC, representing 72% of circulating supply.
üü† An offset applied to LTH-Supply, moving it backwards by 155-days. This is an attempt to model where the original acquisition took place by this cohort.
Inspecting the latter üü† curve, we can see a very similar bear market pattern to 2018 emerges with respect to the LTH acquisition behaviour. Of the most interest however, is the extremely strong upwards trajectory ‚ÜóÔ∏è throughout the LUNA collapse in May 2021.
Despite prices having since sold off 56%+, from $40k down to sub-$18k, an industry wide deleveraging event, and historic global macro-economic turmoil, the LTH cohort added significantly to their holdings throughout this period.
Live Professional Chart
The bullish case for Bitcoin at present is one of unwavering conviction, and persistent balance growth by the HODLer cohort. Liquid coins continue to flow out of exchanges, relative stablecoin buying power is increasing, and extreme volatility and severe downside has thus far failed to shake out Bitcoins most die-hard believers.
Summary and Conclusions
In this edition, we sought to provide a bearish and bullish case for Bitcoin given the historically low volatility profile, which rarely ends with a whimper. With a likely explosive move on the horizon, we can use on-chain data to gauge the supply an demand balance.
The Bear Case
is one of a historically low on-chain utilization profile, and a looming miner deleveraging event. With a $1.5B miner overhang, being just one source of distressed BTC, and multi-year lows in both trading and transfer volumes, significant distribution may meet thin orderbooks.
The Bull Case
takes a view on the HODLers of last resort, whereby the supply flows out of exchanges, and into HODLer wallets is at an all-time-high. Despite being small in relative number, the conviction of Bitcoins die-hard believers is unshaken, and their balance continues to grow, through thick and thin.

After consolidating in an increasingly tight range since early September, this is the first relief rally in many months.
In this weeks edition, we will assess a suite of metrics which present a relatively consistent case for the market hammering out a Bitcoin bottom, with almost textbook resemblance to prior cycle lows. At this stage, the 2022 bear has inflicted severe financial loss, both on investors who have capitulated, and those who still weather the storm. The last remaining piece of the puzzle appears to be a component of duration, time, and ultimately, investor apathy.

Hammering Out The Bottom
In our previous
WoC 41 report
, we described the market conditions of the
Bottom Discovery
phase, particularly following a significant capitulation through the primary bear market floor (shown in dashed lines). This phase üü™ has historically seen prices range bound between two well-known floor-tracking models:
Realized Price
üü†: which can be considered as the average acquisition price per coin for the wider market. When the spot price trades below the realized price, the aggregate market can be considered to be in unrealized loss.
Mayer Multiple Lower Band (0.6*200 DMA)
üü¢: The Mayer Multiple is simply the ratio between price and the 200D-SMA, a widely observed model in traditional financial analysis. This metric helps gauge over, and under-bought conditions, with cyclical oversold conditions historically coinciding with Mayer Multiple values below 0.6.
Remarkably, this pattern has repeated in the current bear market, with the June lows trading below both models for 35 days. The market is currently approaching the underside of the Realized Price at $21,111, where a break above would be a notable sign of strength.
Live Advanced Workbench-
After identifying initial signposts for a typical bottoming formation, the next step is to define a potential range of price fluctuation for this stage of the bear market.
Two ideal candidates for approximating the range bottoming formation are the aforementioned
Realized Price (Upper Band ~$21.1k)
üü†, as well as the
Balanced Price (Lower Band ~ 16.5k)
üîµ. Balanced Price represents the difference between Realized Price and Transferred Price (
coinday time-weighted price
). This can be thought of as a form of a ‚ÄúFair Value‚Äù model, capturing the difference between what was paid (cost-basis) and what was spent (transferred).
Compared to historical precedence, price has traded within this range for ~3 months, in comparison to prior cycles which lasted between 5.5 and 10 months. This suggests duration may remain a missing component from our current cycle.

Coins Changing Hands
As highlighted in July (
WoC 28
), throughout the
Bottom Discovery
phase, diminishing investor profitability results in the redistribution of coin wealth, as weaker hands capitulate into extreme financial pain. This progressive changing of hands can be analyzed by tracking the
UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD)
, which illustrates the distribution of supply based on the acquisition price.
The magnitude of wealth redistribution can be highlighted by monitoring the change in the volume of coins with an acquisition price within the two pricing models highlighted above. The following two charts compare the URPD on the entry, and exit dates for the 2018-19 bear market:
URPD as of 19-Nov 2018 when price first broke below the Realized Price.
URPD as of 2-Apr-2019 when price broke out above the Realized Price.
During the 2018-2019 bottom discovery phase, around 22.7% of the total supply (30.36% - 7.65%) was redistributed as spot prices traded within in the aforementioned range.
Live Professional Chart
Live Professional Chart
Performing the same analysis in 2022, we can see that around 14.0% of supply has been redistributed since the price fell below the Realized Price in July, with a total of 20.1% of supply now having been acquired in this price range.
Compared to the end of the 2018-19 cycle, both the magnitude of wealth redistribution, and the final supply concentration at the bottom are somewhat lower in the 2022 cycle. This adds further evidence to the case that additional consolidation and duration may still be required to fully form a bear market floor.
That said, the redistribution which has occurred to date is significant, and certainly indicates that a resilient holder base is actively accumulating within this range.

Seeking the Light
With many longer-term components of a bear market floor in play, the next step is to introduce a series of indicators which are useful for mapping out a potential transition back towards a bull market. The Percent of Supply in Profit metric can be used to establish three distinct states of each market cycle:
Euphoria (Profit-Dominance)
üü©: When a parabolic price uptrend is in play during the bull market, the Percent of Supply in Profit exceeds 80%.
Bottom Discovery (Loss-Dominance)
üü•: At the twilight of the bear market, when an extended period of price depreciation causes the share of supply in loss to become dominant (Percent Supply in Profit < 55%)
Bull/Bear Transition (Profit-Loss Equilibrium)
üüß: The transition periods between the two prior conditions, where Percent Supply in Profit remains between 55% and 80%.
At present, the Percent of Supply in Profit is at 56%, which indicates that the recent price recovery above $20k is at the lower bound of the transitional phase, signalling that an appreciable redistribution has occurred below $20k to date.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also assess the implied financial strain on the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort and their corresponding reaction.
During the late stages of a bear market, a pattern that is congruent through all cycles is the capitulation of a sub-set of the LTH cohort üü•. These capitulations are identified by periods where the aggregate LTH Cost Basis üîµ is above than the overall market cost-basis Realized Price üü†. This means that the average Long-Term Holder, who has weathered the full cycles volatility, has actually underperformed the wider market.
This condition of acute financial stress has been in play for 3.5 months so far, which is shorter than similar intervals in previous bear markets. However, note that this condition is usually in play until well into the bull market transition.
Live Professional Workbench
Confirming the ongoing stress on Long-Term investors, we can define a simple but powerful compass to spot early indications of new demand entering the market üü©.
When the capital inflow of new investors (Short-Term Holders) begins to exceed sell side pressure, the aggregated profit held by the wider market will exceed that of the Long-Term Holder cohort.
Interestingly, we have not yet observed this shift in profitability, with the Percent of LTH Supply in Profit üî¥ currently at 60%. Considering the total Percent Supply in Profit
üîµ is at 56%, in order for this model signal to signal a recovery üü©, spot prices likely need to reclaim the $21.7k level.
Live Professional Workbench
Embracing Losses
So far, we have assessed the market from the holders perspective (the unrealized profit/loss). The aforementioned shift in momentum can also be examined from the active investors point of view (realized profit/loss).
To accomplish this goal, we utilize the
Realized Profit/Loss Ratio
metric, which measures the ratio between the volume of coins moved in profit to those coins that are transferred in the loss. Tracking the quarterly average of this metric enables analysts to gauge the macro dominance of coins moving in profit.
Profit Dominant Regime > 1
üü©: At the early stages of the bear markets, and throughout the bull run, demand is strong enough to adsorb selling pressure, and profits exceed losses by a wide margin.
Loss Dominant Regime < 1
üü•: During the extended phase of the bear markets, where the supply side is not met with sufficient demand. This generally culminates as a large-scale capitulation event, which acts to entice smart capital back into the system.
The interval between dropping below, and reclaiming the 1.0 level, is often where bearish sentiment is at its peak and demand liquidity at its lightest üîµ.
The 90D-SMA of
Realized Profit/Loss Ratio
typically collapses and remains below 1.0 mid-way through a bear, but before ultimate capitulation, providing an early warning signal. Moreover, this metric has historically recorded a sharp cross over the 1.0 level in early bull phases.
At the current state, this indicator is at 0.57, denoting the dominance of coins moving at a loss remains. Therefore, the new wave of capital, and profit taking has not yet fully eclipsed the magnitude of sellers realizing losses.
Live Advanced Chart
As the final piece of this investigation, we aim to analyze the magnitude of Realized Losses. To account for the rising market capitalization each cycle, we normalize Realized Loss by the market cap to produce a
Relative Realized Loss
metric. Next, we can construct an indicator using the the Monthly üî¥ and Yearly üîµ sum of Relative Realized Loss to identify shifts in momentum, and significant capitulation events.
During the last three bear markets, the monthly value has abruptly peaked above the yearly during two distinct periods of extreme realized loss.
Post-ATH Wave (A):
At the early stages of a bear market, when a top-heavy market undergoes its first large wave of loss realization during the post-ATH sell-off.
Bottom Discovery Wave (B)
: Late stage bear markets often culminate with a major capitulation event, where a significant wave of loss realization occurs, and peak negative sentiment is reached. This wave is often intensified by the stress of the time component of establishing a market floor, until sellers finally hit exhaustion.
Revisiting the historical instances of this pattern, it is evident that both A/B waves of loss realization have occurred at scale. The second wave B is usually of a much higher magnitude, and is often followed by a notable descending trend in the yearly trace üîµ. This is the result of the market reaching peak apathy and seller exhaustion.
These are the constructive signs of the market embracing the financial pain inflicted on remaining investors by both the time, and price components. However, the final condition before a convincing transition towards a bull market is a substantial decline ‚ÜòÔ∏è in the yearly cumulative trend.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
In this edition, we have leveraged multiple floor-price tracking models and demonstrated that the market certainly appears to be in a near textbook example of a Bitcoin Bottom Discovery phase. The Balanced Price ($16.5k) and Realized Price ($21.1k) have once again helped establish range-bounds while the market hammers out a foundational floor.
The portion of supply which has changed hands and been repriced so far is significant, although smaller in magnitude compared to the 2018-19 lows. We also demonstrate that across several metrics, the 2022 floor lacks a degree of duration, and perhaps an additional phase of redistribution is needed to test investor resolve.
From both the Unrealized and the Realized Profit/Loss standpoints, the results indicate that a fragile but constructive balance between supply and demand exists in the market. However, the network has not yet experienced a convincing influx of new demand yet. It does not appear that the bear-to-bull transition has formed as yet, however, there does appear to be seeds planted in the ground.

However, the stress present in the bond market remains persistent with further inversions across the front end of the yield curve, most notably in the 3month T-Bill in respect to the 10yr risk-free rate.
In response, Bitcoin prices have experienced a relatively small upwards surge, applying upwards pressure on key on-chain cost-basis' in its first bid for recovery. This price action is supported by muted HODLer behavior and the first glimmers of demand re-entering the system, as the asset class attempts to begin the long climb out of the depths of the bear market.

HODLers Remain Firm
We shall will our analysis with an assessment of the HODLer cohort, by inspecting their spending behaviors via the
HODLer Net Position Change metric
. This tracks the 30 day change in HODLed or Lost coin supply, which are the most dormant on-chain.
A dichotomy in HODLer behavior can be observed on either side of the May 2021 sell off.
üî¥ Prior to this inflection point, HODLers can be seen aggressively distributing coins, realizing profits into the cycle topping formation. Distribution peaked at a rate of -150k BTC / Month, expending a total of -450k BTC in the process.
üü¢ Following a breakdown in price action, the spending footprint of HODLers transitioned into an accumulation regime, amassing coins at a rate of+40k BTC / Month. This regime has culminated in a cumulative inflow of +500k BTC over an 8 month period.
This process has fully replenished the reserve of coins distributed this cycle, and pushed the HODLed and Lost coins metric to a new ATH.
Live Professional Workbench
The opposite supply region to HODLed coins can be considered ‚ÄòHot coins‚Äô, which are actively participating in day-to-day trade of the Bitcoin economy.
The supply younger than 6 months old which is available on the market has remained around historic lows since May 2022 and continues to decline, further reiterating the extreme level of HODLing present in the current market.
Live Advanced Workbench
Next, we assess the
Realized Cap HODL Waves
, which allow for the inspection of USD denominated wealth held by specific age cohorts. Isolating for coins younger than 3-months old can be used to approximate the wealth of the speculative investor class.
Currently, the USD wealth held by young coins is at an all time low, representing only 10% of the network Realized Cap. By virtue of a binary system, this means that wealth that is older than 3-months has reached an ATH in both relative, and absolute terms of the network Realized Cap. This suggests the HODLer cohort are the most dominant they have ever been, signalling a resounding refusal to spend and sell, despite the persistent challenges in global capital markets.
Live Advanced Chart
Subsequently, we can employ the
Realized HODL Ratio
to compare this balance of wealth held between between young and mature coins in a macro scale oscillator. This can be considered under the following framework:
An uptrend in RHODL Ratio
suggests growing dominance of USD wealth held by newer speculative buyers, and is typical of bull markets, and Bitcoin market tops.
A downtrend in RHODL Ratio
indicates growing dominance of USD wealth held in older coins, suggesting increased HODLing, and long-term accumulation behavior.
A flat, range bound RHODL Ratio
indicates that the rate of change between old and young dominance is at an equilibrium. This a transitional period is often observed around market inflection points such as distributive markets tops, and accumulation bottoms.
After remaining within a downwards trending regime since the November ATH, the angle of RHODL descent is beginning to soften, suggesting the balance between young and old coin wealth is finding an equilibrium. This pattern is occurring at similar levels and duration to that observed in the 2018-19 market low.
Live Advanced Chart
üí°
New Dashboards Released
We have released a new
HODL Wave Dynamics
dashboard which explores the Bitcoin supply as it matures through various age cohorts.
Our suite of Bitcoin dashboards are being redesigned to help Glassnode members solve problems, and answer key questions in the market. Our new dashboards include contextualized sets of Studio metrics, custom workbench constructions, and analyst notes for key topics in the Bitcoin space.
We can leverage the
Adjusted Reserve Risk
metric (a new variant by the original author
@hansthered
) which is a cyclical oscillator that quantifies the balance between the aggregate incentive to sell, and the actualized expenditure of long dormant coins.
Uptrends in Adjusted Reserve Risk
suggest the incentive to sell is increasing, and the realization of profits is becoming the primary mechanic in the market.
Downtrends in Adjusted Reserve Risk
indicate the perceived opportunity of HODLing is increasing, thus HODLing is becoming the dominant mechanic in the market.
The formation of an accumulation bottom can be described by the Adjusted Reserve Risk metric under the following substructure:
üü•
Phase 1:
The incentive to sell collapses alongside post-blow-off-top price action, indicating an abrupt end to the traders market. Over time, gradual accumulation and HODLing becomes the dominant mechanic.
üüß
Phase 2:
The market perceived opportunity cost of spending coins approaches a maximum, as HODLing behavior reaches peak intensity, and the worst of the bear market passes by.
üü©
Phase 3
: The incentive to sell begins to show first signs of recovery, as new demand enters, profits are taken, and bottom formation takes place.
Presently, the Adjusted Reserve Risk appears to have entered Phase 3, aligned with the peak in HODLing behavior observed above, and signalling a potential transition towards a regime of increasing incentives to sell. In other words, those who have held coins for long periods of time are likely to become the dominant source of sell-side pressure on the road ahead (a signal of potential seller exhaustion from the 2021-22 cycle).
Live Advanced Workbench
A Burst of Interest
A small, but noticeably consistent change is taking place in the Bitcoin transaction space, as a sustained impulse higher in total coins transferred hits our nodes Mempool. This observable change in character provides initial signs of a potentially constructive shift in demand.
This trend remains in its infancy but is one to monitor.
Live Advanced Chart
Analyzing the transfer volume settled by the Bitcoin network on any given day, there has been a substantial decline from the $13B/day peak during the Jan to May 2021 rounded top, to a cycle low of just under $3B/day today, representing a -77% decline.
However, we are beginning to see a initial signs of stabilization, and perhaps an uptick in daily volume settled from the September lows, now oscillating between $3B and $4B/day.
Live Professional Chart
/
Advanced Variation
As highlighted above, the presence of young coins, often synonymous with retail investors, has waned since the May 2021 sell off. This is also evident by the decline in small sized transfer value settled each day.
Transactions from $0 to $10k have seen a stark decline from $430B/day in Jan 2021, to $220B/day at the moment, a decline of -49%. Nonetheless, we can see early signs of stabilization taking place in transfer volume contribution from these smaller sized entities, whom tend to respond quickly and early to the emergence of an upside rally.
This feature which was also present in the 2018 bottoming formation period.
Live Professional Chart
In contrast, we are seeing an opposite structure forming in transactions worth $1M+ with total volume from large participants continuing to decline. This again bares similarities to the 2018 bottom, where transaction volumes by larger entities were actually quite slow off the mark, waiting until the bullish trend was properly established before stabilization in transfer volume occurred.
Live Professional Chart
We can confirm this observation via the
Relative Activity of Small and Large Entities
metric. This metric takes into account the observable positive skewness in USD denominated Bitcoin transaction volumes. Here, we have constructed an oscillator that comparing the ratio between the 7-day MA, and the 365-day MA of median (small entities, üîµ), and mean (large entities, üî¥) transaction volumes.
Once more, we can highlight the similarity in structure between the activity of small and large entities during the 2018 bottom. Following the final capitulation in price action, the activity of small entities increased and effectively front-ran the 2019 and 2020 bullish impulses, suggesting an influx of small sized transactions, and thus an initial sign of returning demand.
Live Professional Chart
/
Advanced Variation
The aforementioned thesis can be further explored by analyzing the
Median RVT Ratio
. This metric compares the balance between the network valuation, denoted by the Realized Cap, and the presence of retail participation levels represented by the Median Transfer Volume. This can be considered the number of ‚Äúmiddle of the pack‚Äù transactions that are equivalent to the current network valuation.
Increases in the Median RVT Ratio
suggest an ongoing expulsion of retail presence until equilibrium is reached.
Decreases in the Median RVT Ratio
generally indicates an increasing presence of retail participation.
A stable Median RVT Ratio
occurs when both retail participation and network valuation are constant, indicating an equilibrium of network usage. This has historically been associated with macro scale transitional periods.
Following the sell-off punctuated by the LUNA-UST collapse, the presence of retail sized investors has been in equilibrium with the Realized Cap, suggesting a detox of speculative, low-conviction investors has occurred. The component of duration however does appear to be missing from the current regime when contrasted with the 2019 precedence.

Product Updates
October was an exciting month at Glassnode, as we announced our acquisition of
Accointing.com
, and continued to release suites of new metrics, workbench constructions, dashboards, and more. See our latest
Product Update for October
for a full overview.
October Product Update
Cost Basis Overhead
With very early signs of demand showing up across the network, it is prudent to assess market levels of interest that may lie ahead, particularly where longer-term investors may be engaged as sellers. As such, we can assess the on-chain cost basis for Long-Term Holders, Short-Term Holders, and the wider market.
Both the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis üî¥ and Realized Price üü†
are trading at approximately the same level of $21.1k, which the market is currently contesting with.
The Long-Term Holder Cost Basis üîµ
remains higher up, trading at $23.5k and would be an area of interest for those investors who have weathered recent volatility, but remain unsure about stability in the the future.
A notable decline in the Short-Term Holder cost basis can be observed in recent weeks, due primarily to the significant volume of coin redistribution that was discussed in the
WoC 44
. This acts to drive the average Short-Term Holder acquisition price closer to the market value, and signifies an increasingly advantageous position for recent market entrants.
The second key observation is the clustering of these three on-chain cost basis in such a close proximity. This indicates a cost basis convergence for the average Bitcoin investor, irrespective of holding time, which makes the investor cohort somewhat more homogeneous (a reset of investor psychology so to speak).
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The price insensitive HODLer cohort remain steadfast, as coins continue to flow into the HODLers aggregated treasuries, pushing their holdings to new ATHs. The wealth held by the HODLer class has also reached ATHs, potentially indicating a peak in HODLer strength as the incentive to realize profits begins to grow.
As HODLers attempt to sustain a floor price, it is the Short-Term Holders who must step in and inject organic capital into the system to aid in the stabilization of key levels. This is evidenced by both the structural change to Mempool activity as well as the surge of activity from small entities, as the demand for transactional verification and network usage slowly, but surely grows.
Despite unprecedented conditions across global markets. the structural price action of Bitcoin remains similar to prior cycles as price marches towards both the market wide cost-basis, as well as the Short-Term Holder cost-basis. Reaction to these key levels will be imperative to monitor in the coming weeks, as a confirmed flip of these resistance levels suggests the first glimmers of recovery across the long, arduous road ahead.

Within the span of just one week
, one of the most popular and high trade volume exchanges, FTX.com;
Experienced a bank run.
Halted customer withdrawals.
Entered into failed talks to be acquired by competitor Binance.
Discovered to be short between $8B to $10B in customer funds.
Had exchange wallets allegedly hacked to the tune of ~$500M.
Filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy alongside sister company FTX US.
Exposed what appears to be malfeasance perpetrated by the Alameda / FTX entity.
Such an event is a tremendous blow to the industry, leaving millions of customers with trapped funds, damaging many years of constructive industry reputation, and creating new credit contagion risks, many of which likely still remain undetected. The event brings back unfortunate memories of the failure of Mt Gox in 2013, whereby a significant custodian is found to be fractionally reserved.
Amidst this chaos, it is important to remember that the digital asset space is a free market, and this event represents a failure of a trusted centralized entity, not of the underlying cryptographic technology. There are no bail outs for Bitcoin, and the forest fire of an industry wide deleveraging will purge all excess and malfeasance, albeit with significant pain along the way. With a renewed focus on exchange Proof-of-Reserves underway, and a push towards self-custody, the market will heal, recover, and return stronger in the months and years ahead.
In this weeks report, we will cover:
Details regarding the bank run on FTX on-chain wallets.
Wider impact on exchange balances and self-custody.
Observations the impacts to Bitcoin long-term holder conviction.

Fractional Reserves
The truth regarding how FTX managed to blow a hole between $8 to $10B in their balance sheet, and lose customer deposits will (hopefully) come to light in time, although much evidence suggests a misappropriation of funds via sister hedge fund Alameda Research. For background information, and analysis on the relationship between Alameda, FTX and Binance, we refer readers to the following sources:
Twitter thread
detailing the flow of funds between Alameda, FTX and Binance.
Dashboard with relevant charts
showing the lifetime flow of funds between entities.
Video report
covering these initial findings.
Tracking the exchange reserves for FTX has been somewhat of a challenge for many data providers over the years, with our own experience being that FTX utilized a relatively complex peeling chain system for their BTC reserves. In April to May this year, the FTX reserves within our cluster had reached a peak of over 102k BTC. This dramatically declined by 51.3% in late-June.
Reserves have since persistently declined until reaching effectively zero during this weeks bank run. As claims of Alameda misappropriating customer deposits come to light, this indicates that the Alameda-FTX entity may have in fact experienced severe balance sheet impairment in May-June following the collapse of LUNA, 3AC, and other lenders.
Live Advanced Chart
The supply of ETH held on FTX has also experienced two periods of significant decline:
In June, where reserves dropped by -576k ETH (-55.2%)
This week, falling from 611k ETH to just 2.8k (-99.5%)
Similar to the Bitcoin balance, this leaves close to no ETH in FTX owned wallets, with the bank run effectively clearing what was left from the balance sheet.
Live Advanced Chart
When looking to stablecoin reserves, we can ¬†see that aggregate reserves on FTX started to decline significantly from 19-Oct, dropping from $725M, to effectively zero over the following month.
Stablecoin balances spiked significantly to a new sustained height after the June sell-off, at a time where BTC and ETH reserves had dropped precipitously. This may add further indication that a degree of balance sheet impairment had occurred at that stage, necessitating a swapping or lending of stablecoins for BTC and/or ETH collateral.
Live Advanced Chart
Whilst there remains significant uncertainty regarding what really happened between FTX and Alameda, there remains a growing pool of on-chain data to suggest cracks had formed as far back as May-June. This would leave recent months as being simply a precursor to what was more than likely an inevitable collapse of the exchange.
üí° New Dashboards Released
We have released tho new dashboards which explore changes in Bitcoin cohort size, and balances as a toolbox to observe investor behaviour. The following charts are sourced from our
Entity Balance Change dashboard (T3)
, and can be supplemented by our
Address Cohorts Dashboard (T2)
.
Safety in Self-Custody
On an industry wide scale, we have seen a withdrawal of coins from exchanges at a truly historic rate, as holders seek the safety of self-custody. The following charts map out the aggregate balance change of exchanges, investor wallet cohorts, and miners since the 6-Nov, when rumblings of troubles at FTX were still in their infancy.
Exchanges have seen one of the largest net declines in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in 7-days. This compares with only three periods in the past; Apr-2020, Nov-2020, and June to July 2022.
Live Advanced Chart
A similar observation can be made for Ether, with 1.101M ETH being withdrawn from exchanges over the last week. This makes for the largest 30-day balance decline since September 2020 during the peak of 'DeFi Summer', where demand for ETH was sky high for use as collateral in smart contracts.
Live Advanced Chart
Whilst BTC and ETH exchange reserves declined this week, stablecoins have on net flowed into exchanges, with over $1.04B in combined USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI flowing in on 10-Nov. This makes for the 7th largest daily net inflow in history.
Live Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard
This has pushed stablecoins held across all exchange reserves to a new all-time-high of $41.186B. We can also see a notable increase in BUSD dominance, with over $21.44B held in exchange reserves. This is likely a result of Binance's recent stablecoin consolidation towards BUSD, as well as its growing dominance as the largest exchange in the world.
USDT exchange reserves have declined slightly, and USDC reserves more dramatically over recent months, indicating a potential shift in market preference is underway.
Live Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard
Interestingly, a great deal of these stablecoins are being sourced from smart contracts, and have been withdrawn from Ethereum smart contracts at a rate of $4.63B per month. This acts to highlight how acute the demand for immediate dollar liquidity has become.
Live Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard
As a result, the market has entered an interesting state, whereby centrally issued stablecoins are flowing into exchanges, whilst the two major crypto assets, BTC and ETH are being withdrawn at historic rates. The chart below is a two part model reflecting the following:
A lack of üüß in the barcode trace indicates that exchanges have seen a net BTC + ETH outflow.
The oscillator shows the net inflow of stablecoins, minus the net USD flow of BTC + ETH. For positive values üü¢, it indicates an excess of stablecoin 'buying capacity' has flowed into exchanges.
Here we can see that overall, the net buying power of stablecoins on exchanges has increased by $4.0B/mth. This demonstrates that despite market turmoil, investors appear to favor holding trustless BTC and ETH assets, rather than than centrally issued stablecoins at this time.
This is quite an intriguing signal, and could be argued to be a constructive sign of confidence in the base layer assets, and a case for the market seeking safety in self-custody.
Live Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard
Bitcoin Balances Swell
With such large volumes of BTC flowing out of exchanges, we can see that across all wallet cohorts, the FTX event has triggered a distinct change in investor behavior. On-chain wallets, from Shrimp (< 1 BTC) to Whales (> 1k BTC) have experienced a net balance increase üü¶ throughout the FTX collapse. For some cohorts, this has been an almost perfect 180-degree turn from a regime of sustained distribution üü• over recent months.
Live Professional Dashboard
The Shrimp cohort (< 1BTC) have added 33.7k BTC this week alone, resulting in a 30-day increase of +51.4k BTC. This level of balance inflow is the second largest in history, surpassing the peak of the 2017 bull market.
Live Professional Dashboard
The Crab cohort, with between 1 and 10 BTC are similarly aggressive, pulling 48.7k BTC off exchanges, and approaching acquisition rates in line with the 2017 bull market peak. Entities holding < 10 BTC now command over 15.913% of the circulating supply, a new, and convincing all-time-high.
Live Professional Dashboard
Wallet cohorts between 10 and 1k BTC are colloquially referred to as Fish, and Sharks. This cohort reflects entities with balances on the order of high net worth individuals, trading firms, and institutional investors.
After several months of slowing balance growth, this week has motivated a significant cohort balance increase of 78.0k BTC, and one of the largest 7-day balance increases in history for this cohort. This likely reflects, in part, a 'withdraw now, ask questions later' mentality.
Live Professional Dashboard
For Whales, defined as those with > 1k BTC, we have only considered coins directly flowing in and out of exchanges. This is to better reflect true investor activity for these large entities. Whales have actually been net accumulators over recent weeks, with a 30-day balance change of +53.7k BTC.
Their on-net participation over this week however has been an order of magnitude less than other cohorts, with only a modest balance increase of +3.57k BTC.
Live Professional Dashboard
Lastly on the balance change front, we have Bitcoin miners, who are already an embattled industry, and under extreme stress due to recent coin price declines. As Hash Prices pushes to all-time-lows, miners have been forced to liquidate around 9.5% of their treasuries this week, spending 7.76k BTC. This is the sharpest monthly miner balance decline since September 2018, and demonstrates the pro-cyclical nature of Bitcoin miners.
Live Professional Dashboard
HODLers Resolve
In the last section of this newsletter, we will cover the response of the Bitcoin HODLers, to inspect whether there has been a discernible loss of conviction. Given the scale of impact, and far reaching consequences of the FTX implosion, if there was a time for HODLers to lose faith in the asset, it is likely now.
Long-Term Holder supply, being that which is statistically the least likely to be spent, has declined by -61.5k BTC since 6-Nov. Approximately 48.1k BTC was spent over the last 7-days, which certainly registers as a non-trivial event. However, given the scale of balance change detailed above, and comparing to historical precedents, it is not yet of a scale to infer widespread loss of conviction. Should this develop into a sustained LTH-supply decline however, it may suggest otherwise.
Live Professional Chart
The chart below presents a 4yr Z-Score of the weekly sum of Revived Supply older than 1yr. Over the last week, 97.45k BTC which were older than 1yr have been spent and potentially returned to liquid circulation.
This represents a +0.83 sigma move on a 4yr basis, which is notable, but not yet of historical magnitude. Like LTH Supply, this is a metric to watch in case it develops into a sustained trend.
Live Professional Chart
The average age per BTC has also climbed to just over 90-days this week, which is triple that observed during the low volatility environment through Sept to Oct. The uptick in older coins being spent is noteworthy, and is in line with peaks seen during previous capitulation sell-off events, and even the 2021 bull market profit taking.
A sustained up-trend or elevated level of Dormancy may indicate a more widespread panic has taken root amongst the HODLer cohort.
Live Professional Chart
Finally, we can return to our 4yr Z-Score construction, but this time for the weekly sum of coindays destroyed (CDD). Here we can see that after a lengthy period of an extremely dormant coin supply, the volume of coinday destruction this week hit +1.9 standard deviations above the mean. A total of 165M coindays have been destroyed this week, which is equivalent to the spending of 452.2k BTC that have been held for 1-year.
Live Advanced Chart
Overall, there has certainly been a degree of immediate panic within the HODLer cohort. However, given the magnitude of the circumstances, this is arguably an expected result. What is likely of more interest is whether these spikes soften in coming weeks, which would suggest that this shake-out is more of an 'event', rather than a 'trend'.
On the other hand, a sustained push higher in older coins being spent, and a decline in LTH supply would be clear warning signs that a more widespread loss of conviction and concern may be in play.
Summary and Conclusions
The collapse of FTX is significant, and a real black eye to the industry. It is a truly horrendous event where users of a platform find themselves trapped, and have funds entrusted to a custodian lost. This is sadly a forest fire, and a deleveraging event that was due to happen eventually, and as is tradition, Bitcoin, and the industry will bounce back stronger.
We at Glassnode wish every single one of our readers the very best in these challenging times, and remain extremely confident in the resolve of an industry, which is routinely tested, unlike any other. In times like this, be like Bitcoin; resilient, robust; sound and unstoppable. There is a road of opportunity ahead.
As with all similar disasters of the past, time and dedication will heal the wounds, and this truly free market will learn from the mistakes, grow stronger, and come back more resilient than it was yesterday.
Tick tock, next block.

Coins Flood Out of Exchanges
As we covered in
last weeks edition
, outflows from exchanges and into investor wallets of almost all sizes have been historical in scale, as BTC holders seek safety in self-custody. As a result, the 30-day net position change of all exchange balances has reached a new all-time-high for outflows this week.
BTC is currently flowing out of exchanges at a rate of -172.7k BTC per month, eclipsing the previous peak set following the June 2022 sell-off.
Live Advanced Chart
Total confirmed transactions have also seen an uptick over the last two weeks, reaching a multi-month high of 246k confirmed transactions per day. Out of this total, around 29.2% were related exchange withdrawal transfers (77.1k withdrawals), and 18.2% were exchange deposits transfers (48.1k deposits).
This burst of exchange related activity pushes the dominance of exchange deposit or withdrawal transactions to 47.4% of the toal, the highest level year-to-date. Historically, higher exchange dominance can be associated with bull markets (sustained trends), and high volatility sell-off events (short-term spikes).
Live Advanced Dashboard
On a 30-day moving average basis, the combined USD denominated inflow and outflow volumes across all exchanges spiked higher, reaching $1.72B/day this week. The chart below presents this monthly average üî¥ relative to the yearly average üîµ as a gauge for overall momentum of the Bitcoin economy.
Historically, periods where the monthly average of exchange volumes exceeds the yearly has signalled positive market momentum, as more coin volume changes hands. In the current market, the combined exchange inflow and outflow volume would have to reach and sustain levels above $2.15B to signify positive momentum on this front.
Live Advanced Dashboard
Whales Underwater
A trend which can be observed during the later stages of the 2018-19 bear market is an aggregate increase in the Mean Inflow Volume to exchanges. In other words, the average deposit size across all major exchanges increases in USD terms as the market formed a cycle bottom. This is present across all major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken.
A similar trend has been in effect since late May following the collapse of the LUNA-UST project. This indicates that in general, there has been a net increase in larger size deposits over the last 6-months. This indicates that entities such as whales, institutions, and trading firms have had a larger dominance across exchange deposits.
Live Advanced Dashboard
A driving factor of this may be the financial position of Whales (entities > 1k BTC). The yellow trace below shows the average withdrawal price of the Whale cohort since 5-Jul-2017 (launch of Binance), which is trading at $17,825.
With spot prices currently at $16.2k, this is the the first time since March 2020 that this Whale cohort has been at an unrealized loss. In response, Whales have actually been depositing coins to exchanges, with an excess of between 5k and 7k BTC per day in net inflows over the past week.
Live Advanced Dashboard
This magnitude of financial pain is being expressed across the wider market, with one of the largest spikes in Realized Loss in the 2020-22 cycle. A peak daily value of -$1.45B in realized loss was locked in this week, ranking as the fourth largest in history.
A comparably small $83M in realized profits occurred, suggesting that the vast majority of spent volume at present is sourced from investors from the current cycle, and very little coin volume from previous cycles are on the move.
Live Advanced Dashboard
Old Hands Awaken
A pattern of interest we highlighted in
our last edition
was the uptick in spending by Bitcoin longer-term holders. During bear markets, significant and sustained upticks in old coin spending is often a signal of reduced conviction, fear, and capitulation amongst this more experienced cohort.
The Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB) metric shows that just over 4% of all spent volume was sourced from coins older than 3-months this week, which is the highest level in 2022. This relative magnitude is coincident with some of the largest in history, often seen during capitulation events and wide scale panic events.
Live Advanced Dashboard
The spent BTC volume older than 6-months has hit also the fifth highest value over the last five years. Over 130.6k BTC aged 6-months or more were spent on 17-Nov alone, with the 7-day average now at 50.1k BTC per day.
This suggests that there is significant uncertainty, which is prompting the changing of hands, and or shuffling of coins by longer-term investors.
Live Advanced Dashboard
In the time since FTX collapsed, a total of 254k BTC older than 6-months have been spent, equivalent to around 1.3% of the circulating supply. On a 30-day change basis, this is the steepest decline in older coin supply since the Jan 2021 bull run, where long-term investors were taking profits in the bull market.
Live Advanced Dashboard
The average age per spent coin can be measured via the Dormancy metric, which has also seen a significant uptick over recent weeks. Two traces are show below, for different variants of Dormancy:
üîµ
Dormancy
: which has rallied to 44-days, and presents the average age per spent coin across the whole market.
üî¥
Entity-Adjusted Dormancy
: has similarly rallied, hitting 78-days. This variant reflects filtered data that removes self-spends and internal wallet reshuffling.
When both metrics experience a similar spike higher, it provides confidence that a meaningful portion of the spending taking place is related to coins changing hands, and less so to internal wallet shuffling. Thus it appears that even Bitcoin long-term holders have been spooked by recent events, and a sub-set of them are spending coins and divesting in response.
Live Advanced Dashboard
Finally, we will inspect the behavior of Long-Term Holders, which accounts for the entities that are statistically the least likely to spend in the face of volatility. Their supply has declined by 84,560 BTC post-FTX, which remains one of the most significant declines in the last year. As shown in the chart below, LTH supply declines have exceeded 100k BTC in three back-to-back months through May, June and July this year. This makes the current decline notable, but not the largest, although it is still underway.
Live Professional Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Across many metrics that describe the behavior of Bitcoin longer-term investors, several are signalling that a non-trivial volume of spending, and divestment is underway. As noted last week, a slow-down and retrace of these metrics would signify this may be a short-term event, however with each passing day that these trends persist, it becomes increasingly plausible that a wider scale reduction in confidence is in play.
The Whale cohort are in a mode of net distribution at present, sending between 5k and 7k in excess BTC into exchanges. Meanwhile, the flight of coins off exchanges by almost all cohorts is at an all-time high. The whirlwind impact of the FTX collapse continues to play out, and it remains to be seen just how extensive the shake-up to investor confidence has been.

2022,48,2022-W48,2022-11-28,2022-12-04,Bearish,16206.30,17108.90,16840.55,5.57,Disagree,"The Bitcoin market has continued to consolidate after a chaotic few weeks, with prices trading within a narrow range, holding just above $16k. As the dust settles following the collapse of FTX, the aggregate response of Bitcoin holders is slowly becoming clearer. A key question is whether the recent sell-off can be better characterized as simply a continuation of the bearish trend, or perhaps a trigger of a deeper psychological shift amongst investors.
In this week's edition, we will explore the scale of both realized and unrealized losses amongst Bitcoin holders, in what is now one of the heaviest capitulation events in history. We shall also analyze the shifting behavioral trends which have occurred since the event, and what this tells us about the bigger picture, and the subsequent effects on investor resolve, and seller exhaustion.
A Behavioral Shift
The price of BTC has been trading below the Realized Price ( the cost-basis of the wider market) for over 4.5 months. This has historically correlated with the bottom discovery phase, which can often be visualized and assessed using the
Accumulation Trend Score
metric.
This tool indicates the relative balance change of entities over the last 30 days, with the scale representing both the size of the balance change and its direction (accumulation to distribution).
Values approaching 1
üü£ signify that a large portion of the Bitcoin network has been accumulating coins and
meaningfully increasing their balance
.
Values approaching 0
üü° signify that a large portion of the Bitcoin network has been distributing coins and
meaningfully decreasing their balance
.
From a comparative point of view, the recent strong accumulation score following the recent sell-off resembles that of late 2018. This behavioral shift can be seen immediately following many major sell-off events, including:
November -December 2018 50% sell-off
March 2020 COVID Crash
May 2022 LUNA collapse
June 2022, when the price first fell below $20k
Live Advanced Chart
We can break down which specific entities are participating by leveraging the
Accumulation üü¶ (and Distribution üü•) Trend Scores by wallet cohort
.
Inspecting the following chart illustrates that almost all cohorts have shifted towards accumulation üü¶ after the recent price contraction. This is a signal of both a perceived opportunity to buy but also a widespread move of coins away from exchanges and towards self-custody (
as discussed in WoC 46
).
A similar period of widespread accumulation can be observed after all aforementioned sell-off events.
Live Professional Chart
More detailed investigation of various wallet size cohorts can be supplemented with two recently published Glassnode dashboards:
Address Cohorts
(Advanced):
showing the total number of addresses and 30-day change of cohort numbers.
Entities Balance Change
(Professional):
showing the net holdings and 30-day balance change.
Among all cohorts, the entities holding < 1 BTC (also labelled as Shrimp ü¶ê) have recorded two distinctive ATH waves of balance increase over the last 5-months. Shrimps have added +96.2k BTC to their holdings since the collapse of FTX, and now hold over 1.21M BTC, equivalent to a non-trivial 6.3% of the circulating supply.

New Investors Under Pressure
One consistent event which motivates the transition from a bear back towards a bull market is the dramatic realization of losses, as investors give up and capitulate at scale. November has seen the fourth largest capitulation event on record, recording a 7-day realized loss of -$10.16B. This is 4.0x larger than the peak in Dec 2018, and 2.2x larger than March 2020.
Live Advanced Workbench
This financial stress can also be examined from the perspective of newer investors. By observing the relationship between the cost basis of Short-Term Holders and the Spot Price, the following pattern can be observed throughout Bitcoin cycles.
Bull Market
üü¶: As price appreciates, the average acquisition price of newly purchased supply is consistently in profit (STH-Cost Basis < Spot Price)
Bear Market
üü•: Steady price depreciation results in the new investors' cost basis being above spot prices (STH-Cost Basis > Spot Price)
With the STH-Cost Basis currently at $18.83k, the average recent buyer is underwater by -12%.
Live Professional Workbench
Further analysis of the STH cost-basis during bear markets can therefore produce a compass for tracing the transition phase to bull markets.
Pre-Bottom Discovery (A)
üü¶: Throughout the early stages of a bear market, the aggregated cost basis of all investors remains well below the spot price, as most investors remain profitable (Spot Price > Realized Price).
Bottom Discovery (B)
üüß: after an extended bearish trend, eventually, the market reaches complete capitulation, and the spot price falls below the Realized Price.
Floor Discovery (C)
üü•: As the market experiences a significant sell-off, and sellers approach exhaustion, heavy distribution is met with equal accumulation by others. This drives the STH Cost Basis below the Realized Price, signifying recent buyers have a superior entry to the average holder.
Live Professional Workbench
In the aftermath of FTX price action, this final description of market structure has occurred üü•, signalling a very significant volume of coins have now changed hands, at substantially discounted prices.
We can also quantify the size of the Unrealized Loss relative to the market size.
Relative Unrealized Loss
measures the aggregated loss still held by the wider market, compared to the total market capitalization.
Tracking the weekly average of this indicator shows that at extreme points of prior bear markets, investors were shouldering a loss in excess of 50% of total market cap at the time. This metric has recently peaked at 56%, which is the highest for this cycle, and comparable to prior bear market floors.
Live Advanced Chart
Peak Under-performance
The
Adjusted MVRV Ratio
is a tool which discounts the profit held in dormant or lost supply (coins unmoved for > 7yrs). Values above 1 indicate that the ‚ÄòActive Market‚Äô is in aggregate profit, whilst values below 1 denote the market is underwater.
This metric is currently returning a value of 0.63 (average unrealized loss of 37%), which is very significant since only 1.57% of trading days in bitcoin history have recorded a lower Adjusted MVRV value. In other words, if we discount profit held across the presumably lost supply, the current market is the most underwater it has been since the near pico-bottom set in Dec 2018 and Jan 2015.
Live Advanced Workbench
Not only is the unrealized loss still held in the market historically large, the realized losses have also been historic in magnitude. Here we use the aSOPR metric, which measures the average spending-to-acquisition price for all coins that moved today. Therefore, values above 1 signal dominant profitability, while values below 1 indicate an aggregate loss.
The chart below compares the weekly average of aSOPR üîµ against the Highüü¢ and Low üî¥ bands that reflect a 2-standard deviation move in aSOPR.
The recent market reaction to the FTX sell-off manifested as an aSOPR reading which broke below the low band for the first time since March 2020. The significance of this event is again only comparable with the COVID crash, and the capitulation of the market in December 2018.
Live Advanced Workbench
The chart below shows the 7-day Cumulative Net Realized Profit/Loss, denominated in BTC for comparison between cycles. Remarkably, over the last week, the market realized a net loss equal to -521k BTC, which is again close to the all-time largest recorded in history.
Comparing the current Cumulative Net Realized Loss to the COVID and LUNA Crash, with 44% and 39% price decline respectively, the market has shown a larger degree of strength during the recent capitulation with only 26% correction.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The FTX fallout has triggered one of the largest capitulation events in Bitcoin history, flushing billions of USD value out of underwater investors. The market remains in a degree of stasis, likely needing time to fully digest recent volatility.
However, the characteristics of this capitulation bear several similarities to the darkest points during the 2018 bear market. This sell-off saw significant statistical deviations outside the mean on investor losses. The current unrealized loss held by the actively traded coin supply is effectively at an all-time-low, rivaling only the very pico-bottoms of the 2015 and 2018 bear cycles.
With such a chaotic year to date, the resolve of Bitcoin holders has been firmly tested to a historic degree throughout 2022. So much so there are barely any precedents. Those few analogues that exist in Bitcoin history, albeit small in sample size, turned out in hindsight to be the points of absolute seller exhaustion.

The Week Onchain Dashboard
The Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts
available here
. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our
Youtube Channel
, and visit our
Video Portal
for more video content and metric tutorials.
A Regime of Loss
To begin our assessment, we shall inspect the magnitude of losses realized by all market participants throughout the turbulent deleveraging event in recent weeks.
Both the June 2022 sell-off, and the FTX Implosion prompted investor capitulation events that are of historical scale. The FTX event recorded an ATH one-day loss of -$4.435B. ¬†However, when assessed with a weekly moving average, losses appear to be subsiding. The June Sell-off by comparison sustained over -$700M in losses each day for almost 2 weeks after the event.
Live Advanced Dashboard
We can supplement this analysis by inspecting the ratio between realized profit , and realized loss. Here we can observe that the ratio between realized profit / loss has recorded a new all time low.
This indicates that losses locked in by the market were 14x larger than profit taking events. It is likely this in part reflects how the entirety of the 2020-22 cycle price action is above the spot price.
Previous instances of extremely low Realized Profit/Loss ratios at this scale have historically coincided with a macro market regime shift.
Live Advanced Dashboard
Next, we shall inspect the Realized Capitalization metric, which displays the the net sum of capital inflows, and outflow into the network since inception. We can use this metric to assess the severity of capital outflows from the network after the market cycle peak.
A significant rise can be seen in the Realized Cap following the sell-off in mid-2021. This can be interpreted as market participants taking significant exit liquidity on the rally higher, and thus realizing profits, and increasing the Realized Cap.
Following the LUNA collapse in May 2022, a significant capital outflow can be seen, as investors who purchased near the market top started locking in increasingly large losses.
The exuberance experienced during the H2 2022 rally to the ATH has almost fully retraced, suggesting a near complete detox of this excess liquidity.
Live Advanced Chart
We can then compare the current cycle to all previous major bear markets, measuring from Realized Cap peak, to trough, as a gauge for relative capital outflows:
The 2010-11
saw a net capital outflow equivalent 24% of the peak.
The 2014-15
experienced the lowest, yet a non-trivial capital outflow of 14%.
The 2017-18
recorded a 16.5% decline in Realized Cap, the closest to the current cycle of 17.0%.
By this measure, the current cycle has seen the third largest relative outflow of capital, and has now eclipsed the 2018 cycle, which is arguably the most relevant mature market analogue.
Live Advanced Chart
The realized loss experienced by Bitcoin investors across the past 6 months has been historic in magnitude. Profitability stress is starting to diminish after the event, but has resulted in a complete flush out of all excess liquidity attracted over the last 18-months. This suggests that a complete expulsion of 2021 speculative premium has now occurred.
An Uptick in Blockspace Demand
The Miner Revenue from Fees metric allows for insight into the demand for blockspace, and whether transactors are willing to bid up fees paid for inclusion in the next block. If we compare the monthly fee rate to the longer standing yearly average, we can assess the local fee momentum.
Fee Momentum above 1
üîµ suggests an expansion in miner revenue contribution from fees, relative to the yearly baseline.
Fee Momentum below 1
üî¥indicates a contraction in miner revenue from fees relative to the yearly baseline.
Sustained bear markets are often accompanied by a significant decline in network activity, resulting in fairly lacklustre fee revenue. This deadlock has historically broken in reaction to a major capitulation in price action, where substantially lower prices entices new demand for blockspace. As sellers are expelled, and value buyers take the other side, this excitement creates an uptick in network congestion.
Of most interest is whether this uptick is fleeting, or whether it can be sustained, signifying a potential regime shift is underway.
Live Advanced Workbench
This observation is supported by the the Active Entities Momentum metric, which can be considered under the following framework.
Momentum above 1
üîµ indicates expansion in unique entity activity.
Momentum below 1
üî¥ suggests contraction in unique entity activity.
Again, we note that the recent price drawdown has stimulated an influx of activity on-chain, with this metric breaching above the equilibrium position for the first time since the price rally to $48k in April 2022.
It would be encouraging to see Entity Momentum remain at elevated levels relative to the equilibrium threshold.
Live Professional Workbench
Following on, we introduce a set of yearly rolling standard deviation bands for the Transaction count metric (on Entity-Adjusted basis). This plots out the 14D-SMA for all confirmed transactions, as well as a series of statistical bands within the range of ¬± 2œÉ.
Two key observations can be ascertained:
The dramatic decline in Transaction Count in May 2021 exemplifies a near total expulsion of network activity, similar to that seen in early 2018.
Following the aforementioned event, network activity embarked on a slow, but consistent recovery towards the yearly baseline. This is again similar to late 2018, and much of 2019
The stabilization of Transaction Counts shows that over the course of the last 6-months, the Bitcoin network has been approaching and oscillating around an equilibrium position of demand for blockspace.
Live Professional Workbench
One area which continues to languish is the settlement of volume across the network.
The current volume settled is testing cycle lows, suggesting the utilization of the network for value transfer remains lacklustre, despite improvements in transaction counts, and unique entities.
Live Professional Chart
With transaction counts recovering, but transfer volumes declining, it is likely a reflection of more small size transfers, and declining dominance of larger institutional sized entities. The Relative Transfer Volume Breakdown confirms this, showing the dominance of smaller sized transactions (up to $100k) has increased to around 35%. This is a break from the relatively stable 10% to 12% through the entirety of the 2020-22 cycle.
Live Professional Chart
This can be further critiqued using the RVT Ratio metric shows that the network is near peak under-utilization. This suggests that even after the a significant capital outflow detailed above, the Bitcoin Realized Cap is still relatively high compared to transfer volume.
Live Professional Workbench
There are some constructive improvements in Bitcoin network activity and demand for blockspace. However, this trend remains in its infancy, and lacks the follow-through of transfer volume, which is again approaching cycle lows.
As Above, So Below
Despite improving participant activity, utilization of the network remains lacklustre, and it is prudent to prepare for all possibilities. We consult two on-chain pricing models which reflect network cost basis, and have been visited in prior bear cycles:
The Balanced Price
üîµ is calculated as the difference between Realized Price and Transfer Price. The Transfer Price is the cumulative sum of Coin Days Destroyed in USD, adjusted by circulating supply and total time since Bitcoin's inception.
The Delta Price
üü£ is the difference between Realized Cap and Average Cap, divided by the Circulating Supply, where Average Price is assumed to be the life-to-date moving average of Market Price.
In all prior bear markets, price has traded between the Balanced Price and the Delta Price, with 136-of-4518 (3.0%) of trading days within this range.
With regards to our current market, this creates a range between $15.5k and $12.0k. Price has only entered this channel briefly during the onset of the FTX collapse, before finding support above the Delta Price.
Live Advanced Workbench
When considering direct overhead resistance, we consult the on-chain cost-basis of the wider market, as well as two granular subsets; the Short and Long-Term Holders.
The STH cost basis remains has dived significantly lower of late, indicative of the large volume of coins that changed hands in November. We can also note that all on-chain cost-basis are tightly concentrated within the $18.7k to $22.9k range.
This tight concentration of cost-basis suggests a degree of homogeneity amongst market participants acquisition price. As such, it is more likely that the aggregate market will start to behave in a more cohesive manner in response to volatility. This also suggests that the perceived risk, and ¬†opportunity amongst all participants, old or new, is similar, providing further confluence of a significant full market detox.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion, it is evident that the level of realized financial pain across Bitcoin market participants throughout the last 6 months has been nothing short of staggering, however, the severity of losses do appear to be diminishing over recent weeks.
We can also note a positive shift in character for both network activity and the demand for blockspace. This shift in structure is not however supported by rising transfer volumes, which continue to languish at cycle lows, and suggest an elevated level of retail sized participation.
A rare, but informative market structure is also present, whereby there is a degree of homogeneity amongst acquisition prices across all Bitcoin cohorts. This allows market analysts to assess the entire Bitcoin market as having a similar perception of risk vs opportunity, and a similar stance with regard to their profitability."

With central bank monetary policy performing a 180 degree U-turn, and following decades of extremely loose and easy credit conditions, tightening conditions have caused severe and rapid drawdowns across most asset classes.
This edition of The Week On-chain will be our final one for the year (unless a major industry moving event inspires us for an encore). As such, we will provide a high level overview of the year that was, and where we are in the setup for 2023. In this piece we will cover:
Volatility, Derivatives, and Futures leverage.
The severity of realized losses over the last year.
Bitcoin on-chain supply structure and concentrations.
Cooling off in the Bitcoin mining sector.
Ethereum post-Merge supply dynamics.
Evolving trends in Ethereum gas consumption dominance.

We wish you all the very best over the holiday season, and look forward to another exciting year in 2023.
A Quiet Future
After what has been a truly chaotic year, the Bitcoin market has turned very quiet coming into December. Short-term realized volatility for BTC is currently at multi-year lows of 22% (1-week), and 28% (2-weeks), making for the lowest volatility regime since Oct 2020.
Live Advanced Chart
Futures volumes are similarly depressed, now probing multi-year lows. Both BTC and ETH markets are currently trading similar volumes between $9.5B and $10.5B per day. This shows the massive impact of tightening liquidity, widespread deleveraging, and the impairment of many lending and trading desks in the space.
Live Professional Chart
Open Interest in futures markets has pulled back significantly following the FTX implosion. The chart below shows the Leverage Ratio, calculated as the ratio between Futures Open Interest, and the corresponding asset market cap.
The build up, and unwind of futures leverage in November has been notably more severe for ETH, likely a result of residual 'Merge trades' being closed out. ETH open interest has fallen from 4.75%, to 3.10% of the Market cap. The BTC leverage ratio peaked a week before ETH markets, and has since declined from 3.46% to 2.50% of the market cap over the last month.
Live Professional Chart
Both Bitcoin calendar futures and perpetual swaps are trading in a state of backwardation, with an annualized basis of -0.3%, and -2.5% respectively. Sustained periods of backwardation are uncommon, with the only similar period being the consolidation between May and July 2021. This suggests the market is relatively 'hedged' for further downside risk, and/or heavier with short speculators.
Live Dashboard
Giving Back to the Market
The excess liquidity bubble from the loose monetary policy era in 2020-21 created a record yearly total realized profit on-chain. Over $455 Billion in yearly profits were taken by Bitcoin investors moving funds on-chain, with the peak hit soon after the Nov 2021 ATH.
Since then, a bear market regime has dominated, and the market has given back over $213 Billion in realized losses. This equates to 46.8% of the 2020-21 bull profits, which is very similar in relative magnitude to the 2018 bear, where the market gave back 47.9%.
Live Advanced Chart
Of note is the contribution of Long-Term Holders, whom in this cycle realized two of the largest relative loss spikes in history. Through November, LTH losses peaked at -0.10% of the Market Cap per day, comparable in scale only to the 2015 and 2018 cycle lows. The sell-off in June is similarly impressive at -0.09% of the Market Cap per day, with heavy dominance of LTHs locking in -50% to -80% losses.

Taking a Long-Term View
Despite these spectacularly large losses, the age of the coin supply, and propensity for HODLing by those who remain continues to rise. Long-Term Holder Supply has completely reverted the panic spending after the FTX fiasco, hitting a new ATH of 13.908M BTC (72.3% of circulating supply).
The near linear uptrend in this metric is a reflection of the heavy coin accumulation that occurred in June and July 2022, immediately after the deleveraging event inspired by 3AC and failing lenders in the space.
Live Professional Chart
The chart below provides a view into the density and distribution of the coin-supply, colored by age bands.
Warm colours
indicate a heavy distribution by older coins, typically seen at market tops, and capitulation bottoms.
Cooler colors
indicate maturation, as investors accumulate and leave coins unspent.
Darker bars
indicate heavier coin density (and vice-versa for lighter bars).
After each market leg down in 2022, we can see density of coin re-distribution (and thus re-accumulation) has increased. In particular, the June to October 2022 zone stands out, with many coins acquired between $18k and $24k, which are now ageing into the 6-month+ band (hence the rising LTH Supply above).

A Hard Time for Miners
Last week saw the largest downwards difficulty adjustment since the Great Mining Migration in July 2021. Difficulty declined by 7.32%, signifying a reasonably large portion of the active hashrate was switched off, likely a result of continued income stress.
Live Advanced Chart
As a result, the hash-ribbons have inverted once again, with the cross-over occurring in late-Nov. This signifies that there is sufficient stress in the mining industry that some operators are taking ASIC rigs offline. This is typically associated with the miners income stream falling below their OPEX expense, making the rigs unprofitable.
Live Advanced Chart
This doesn't come as too much of a surprise however, given that hash-price is only barely above all-time-lows. Despite spot prices (~$17k) being 70% higher than they were in October 2020 (~$10k), the amount of hashpower competing to find the next Bitcoin block is now 70% higher.
Live Advanced Chart
After the Merge
The Ethereum Merge, completed on 15-September, was arguably the most impressive engineering feat of the year. To visualise the immediacy of the event, the chart below shows the mean and median block interval over the course of 2022. It is immediately clear where the natural and probablistic variability of Proof-of-Work came to an end, and the precise, pre-determined 12-second blocktime of Proof-of-Stake came into effect.
Live Advanced Chart
Since the Merge, the number of active validators has increased by 13.3%, with over 484k validators now operational. This brings the total ETH staked to 15.618M ETH, which is equivalent to 12.89% of the circulating supply.

Along with the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the Ethereum monetary policy was adjusted to a significantly lower emission schedule. The nominal rate of issuance (blue) is around +0.5%, however after factoring in the EIP1559 burn mechanism (red), this is almost entirely offset to around +0.1% on a typical day. This compares to a net inflation rate of +3.9% prior to the Merge, showing just how dramatic the change to issuance has been.

At the time of writing, the ETH supply change since the Merge has just turned net deflationary, with the current coin supply now -242 ETH lower than it was on at the Merge. This compares to an estimated 1.044M ETH that would have otherwise been issued into circulation under the previous issuance schedule.

WoC 50, 2022
), the markets are almost exactly where we left them.
With that as context, and from the whole Glassnode team, we hope you had a refreshing, and low voilatility break, and welcome you back to the 2023 series of The Week, On-chain.
In a rarely seen feat, Bitcoin managed to trade within a price range of just $557 for over three weeks, with the highest price ($16.9k) just 3.4% above the range low of $16.4k. The end of year period is typically a quiet one for all markets, and in this instance, the digital asset space was no exception.
In this first edition of the year, we will cover the following topics:
Extremely low realized volatility
, which historically precedes explosive market moves (in both directions), with latest examples of Nov 2018, and Apr-2019.
Softness in on-chain activity for BTC and ETH
, coincident with low overall market volatility, and setting up weak a baseline for the new year.
Drawdowns in the Realized Cap
indicating 2022 is comfortably one of the deepest bear markets to date with respect to capital losses.

Bitcoin markets are infamous for their volatility, however in spite of this, the holiday break was exceptionally quiet. Realized volatility over the last month for BTC declined to multi-year lows of 24.6%, of which there are very few instances with similar levels (marked in üü¶). However, all prior examples preceded much higher volatility environments on the road ahead, with most trading higher, and just one (Nov 2018) trading dramatically lower.

A Weak Bitcoin Baseline
Shifting our focus into the on-chain activity space, we can see that a short-term burst of Bitcoin new addresses occurred followed the FTX fiasco, but has since cooled off noticeably. The monthly average üî¥ of New Addresses is returning towards the yearly average baseline üîµ, indicating that network usage is yet to establish a convincing and sustained recovery.
The momentum of on-chain activity metrics is a powerful tool to monitor a recovery in network fundamentals, with the 2019-20 period being a key example from the past.

Despite this short burst of address activity, the total USD value processed by the Bitcoin network has been in free-fall. Daily transfer volume has collapsed from the ~$40B heights in Q3-2022, to just $5.8B/day today.
This returns daily settlement volumes to pre-bull 2020 levels, and largely indicates an expulsion of institutional sized capital flowing across the network.
Live Advanced Dashboard
We can see this in the relative breakdown of transfer volume, where the dominance of $10M+ sized transactions has been a primary contributor to this decline. Large size transfers have fallen from 42.8% dominance prior to the FTX collapse, to just 19.0% today.
This suggests a significant lull in institutional sized capital flows, and perhaps a serious shaking of confidence occurring amongst this cohort. It may also reflect, in part, and sadly, an expulsion of the questionable capital flows associated with the FTX/Alameda entities.

Demand for Bitcoin blockspace continues to remain weak, with negligible upwards pressure on the Bitcoin fee market. The 4-yr Z-Score of miner revenues is yet to make any noteworthy progress back towards positive territory, and remains -0.67 standard deviations below the mean.

This quiet on-chain activity can also be seen in the compressing USD denominated exchange flows for both BTC and ETH. The chart below presents Inflows (+ve) and Outflows (-ve) for Bitcoin üü† and Ether üîµ related to exchange entities we monitor.
Bitcoin inflow volumes are currently between $350M and $400M/day, which are a far cry from the multi-billion dollar levels seen throughout in 2021-22. Also of note is the expanded scale of ETH exchange flows, which have grown from just 30% dominance up to May-2021, to 42% today.

Ethereum Remains Quiet
The Bitcoin network is not alone in experiencing this extremely light on-chain utilization, with the average gas price paid on the Ethereum chain remaining near cycle lows.

Breaking down gas consumption by sector, we can see that several domains are declining in their relative gas consumption dominance: MEV bots, Bridges, DeFi protocols, and ERC-20 tokens. Between Sept-2020 and Sept-2021, these four sectors represented a combined 45.5% of gas consumption, with DeFi protocols commanding the majority of this.
Today however, these four sectors represent for less than half of their peak dominance, and account for 22.6% of network gas consumption.
Live Advanced Chart
The sector which has seen a recent influx of activity and attention are NFTs, which dominated gas consumption throughout 2022, and have recently increased from 13% to 22% dominance.
By and large, the leading NFT markets and projects have maintained a primary foothold on the Ethereum main-chain, and as yet, there has not been a notable migration of existing NFTs towards bridges and other chains. This is potentially a result of several high profile bridge hacks throughout 2022, as well as lower gas fees on main-chain at present.
Live Advanced Chart
A Realized Drawdown
The Realized Cap remains one of the most important metrics in on-chain analysis, providing an elegant tool to monitor capital inflows and outflows from digital assets. The underlying assumption being that when coins transact, their value is pricestamped, and thus avoids valuing long lost coins (like Satoshi's) at the spot price, as it is via Market Cap.
Whilst not perfect, the Realized Cap is arguably one of the better tools available to measure true capital inflows, to compare valuations between assets. It acts to both filter out lost coins, partially account for volume churn (where the same coins constantly transact), and better reflects the true invested value by the market.
With this as context, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has declined by -18.8% since the ATH, representing a net capital outflow of -$88.4B from the network. This makes for the second largest relative decline in history, and the largest in terms of USD realized losses. This resets the Realized cap to May 2021 levels, expelling all invested value throughout the second peak of H2-2021.
Live Advanced Chart
The Ethereum Realized Cap has drawndown by an even larger relative scale, declining by -29.2% since the ATH set in Jan-2022. Ether investors have locked in a total of -$67.1B in net realized losses over the course of 2022.
This also puts the prevailing bear market as the worst in history on a USD denominated realized loss basis, but not yet on a relative scale, eclipsed by the 2018-19 bear market at a 35.8% drawdown.
üóúÔ∏è
Workbench Tip:
Both of these drawdown metrics are built using the

Finally, we close with a new interpretation of market dominance, aimed at addressing some of the aforementioned shortcomings associated with Market Cap dominance. The principle issue with the widely used 'Bitcoin dominance' metric is that the market cap of relatively illiquid tokens are prone to manipulation (such as FTT and others supported by the FTX entity). As such, entities with large and often illiquid stakes can support inflated valuations on paper, but which diverge significantly from underlying market realities.
The model below presents the simplest implementation of
Realized Cap Dominance
, which is a counterpart to the the more traditional
Market Cap Dominance
. It is designed to track the relative structural capital inflow/outflows across the two major and most liquid digital assets, BTC and ETH.
This tool, and principle can be applied to any basket of coins and tokens to track structural changes in dominance, better reflecting real capital flows, and discounting illiquid supply (such as un-vested token allocations, protocol treasuries, or lost supply).

Summary and Conclusions
The 2022-23 holiday period has been historically quiet, and it is rare for such conditions to stick around for long. Past occasions where BTC and ETH volatility was this low have preceded extremely volatile market environments, with past examples trading both higher and lower.
On-chain activity for the two majors remains extremely weak, despite a short-term bump following FTX. Using both on-chain activity, and realized cap drawdowns, it is safe to say that the excesses of H2-2021 has been largely expelled from the system. This process has been painful for investors, however has brought market valuations closer to their underlying fundamentals.

BTC prices rallied from a weekly low of $17k to over $21k, breaking through several widely observed technical and on-chain pricing models.

Back in the Black
The 200D-SMA remains one of the most widely used technical analysis tools across all asset classes, often finding application as a litmus test for macro market trends. This has proven true over the years for Bitcoin, where a simple check of whether price is above or below the 200D-SMA tending to correlate with a macro bullish, or bearish trend, respectively.
With this weeks powerful rally, the market overcame this psychological level at $19.5k. Bitcoin markets often express a strangely consistent cyclical behavior, with this cycle trading below the 200D-SMA for 381-days, which is just 5-days shy the 2018-19 bear market at 386-days.

Sitting just above the 200D-SMA was the Realized Price at $19.7k. Within the world of Bitcoin, this psychological cost basis model is also widely observed. With prices now convincingly above this price model, it indicates that the average BTC holder is back in a net unrealized profit.
To date, the 2022-23 bear market has spent 179-days below the Realized Price, making it the second longest duration across the last four bear cycles.
The chart below presents three variants of the Realized Price, split into cohorts:
üî¥
Short-Term Holder Realized Price ($18.0k)
, the average of coins that changed-hands in the last 155-days.
üü†
Realized Price ($19.7k)
, being the average of all coin holders.
üîµ
Long-Term Holder Realized Price ($22.4k)
, the average of coins which have been held for at least 155-days.
There are several key observations from this model:
There is a notable similarity in market strength to that observed in April 2019
, albeit the current market is yet to breach the LTH-Realized Price.
In both the 2018-19 and 2022-23 bear markets,
all three realized prices converged, indicating a return to a homogeneous holder base
(where the average BTC holder carries an approximately equivalent cost basis, regardless of holding time).
The Short-Term Holder Realized Price is lower than the others
, reflecting a major capitulation style event after FTX collapsed, indicating a significant volume of coins changed hands afterwards.

Estimating Fair Value
The goal of estimating a fair present, or future value for Bitcoin has been the subject of countless modelling attempts and iterations. One such model was first presented by Willy Woo, and is derived from transaction volumes, and the NVT ratio.
This model uses a look-back at the last two years of settlement volume, and then derives an estimated 'implied fair value' based on network value throughput. The variant below uses our Change-Adjusted volume, which filters transfers using industry standard heuristics. There are two notable observations over the last 12-months:
The model greatly over-estimated Bitcoin fair value in 2022. In hindsight, this is likely a result of volumes sourced from large entities undergoing massive deleveraging events, but also with an unfortunate component of wallet (mis)management by the FTX/Alameda entities in their final days.
This model has collapsed in line with the huge reduction in transfer volumes
covered last week
, suggesting a fair value between $8.2k and $10.0k.
Live Advanced Chart
However, with the benefit of glassnode's entity-adjustment algorithms, we can achieve a more accurate representation of true economically meaningful transfer volume, and thus derive a much cleaner NVT Price model, with a visibly stronger relationship to price.
This variant estimates a 'fair value' for Bitcoin between $15.0k and $17.6k based on our best estimate of economical value settled. This is closely aligned with the price range held over the prior month.
Live Professional Chart
Relief For Miners
One of the sectors hit the hardest over the last 12-months has been Bitcoin miners. This was especially visible this cycle as publicly traded companies saw major hits to their valuations, and thus stock prices.
The model below estimates the average cost of BTC production at $18,798, under the assumption that Difficulty reflects the ultimate 'price' of the mining sector.
Live Advanced Chart
An alternative cost of production model equates Difficulty to the rate of coin Issuance, and develops three bands representing:
üî¥ The most efficient miners
üü† The average miners
üü£ The least efficient miners.
The average production cost is estimated to be $17,062, which is similar, but slightly below the model above ($18.8k). Based on both tools, it is likely that miners across the board are seeing more favourable financial conditions ahead, with the market providing some much needed relief (assuming it holds up).

To illustrate this point, the chart below reflects the profitability of the Antminer S19 Pro, released circa May 2020, and until very recently, one of the flagship operational rigs. The colored zones in the chart below reflect estimated profitability levels for this rig under various all-in-sustaining-cost (AISC) assumptions ($/kWh).

Two such periods are clear, being May to Oct 2020 (immediately after the rig release, and halving event), and again from July 2022 until this week. Via this model, the S19 Pro is estimated to have been unprofitable for any miner operating at an AISC over ~$0.10/kWh for the last seven months.

Profits Return
The final topic of interest is the return of profitable transactions on-chain. The aSOPR model is in the process of retesting a value of 1.0 from below, which has proven to be a key resistance level throughout the bear market.

Summary and Conclusions
With an explosive 23.3% rally to start off the year, a wide cross-section of Bitcoin investors (and miners) have seen their net holdings (and operations) return to a profit. This reflects the impact of both strong price appreciation, but also the tremendous volume of coins that changed hands over recent months, resetting their cost basis lower.
With aSOPR and the Realized P/L Ratio testing a break-even value of 1.0, the test as to whether the market can hold onto these gains becomes the next big question."

As this article will discuss the noteworthy shifts in behavior for new investors (Short-term Holders), Long-Term Holders, and miners. For new investors and miners, the recent rally has motivated spending, taking the opportunity to exit and secure some profit. On the other hand, we have seen more resilience for long-term holders, with coins crossing the 6-month age threshold and pushing to new highs.
Exploring the response of both long and short-term cohorts, this report aims to inspect how the recent shift in profitability plays a role in changing the behavior patterns of market participants.

Almost Out of The Woods
The recent surge in price action to the $21k to $23k region involved reclaiming multiple on-chain pricing models, which has historically signified a psychological shift in holder behavior patterns.
The chart below presents two specific models from our
Pricing Model Dashboard
where:
üü¢
Investor Price
($17.4k) is derived from the difference between the Realized Cap and the Thermocap. It reflects the average acquisition price for all coins which have been spent and distributed by miners.
üü£
Delta Price
($11.4k) is calculated from the difference between Realized Cap and the all-time Average Cap. This produces a combined on-chain and technical pricing concept.
Surprisingly, price action across the 2018-2019 and the current bear market bottom discovery phase have spent a similar amount of time within the bounds of the Investor-Delta price band. This suggests an equivalency in durational pain across the darkest phase of both bear markets.
ü™ü
Related Dashboard:
A diverse suite of models tracking cohort cost basis, fair value estimates, and mining cost of production are available in the

dashboard for Advanced members.
Live Advanced Workbench
In addition to the duration component of the bottom discovery phase, we can measure the compression of the Investor-Delta Price range as a proxy for the intensity of market undervaluation. ¬†As displayed above ‚ÜïÔ∏è, the compression of this range is correlated with the magnitude of change in the Realized Cap or volume of capital inflow into the market.
Compression = (Investor Price - Delta Price)/Spot Price
Assessing the historical trend of this Delta-to-Investor compression concept indicates a threshold zone (0.15-0.2 üü•) that can be employed for seeking confirmation for the beginning ‚ÜóÔ∏è and end ‚ÜòÔ∏è of the Bottom Discovery phase.
Considering the current price and compression value, a similar confirmation signal will be triggered when the market price reclaims $28.3k.
Live Advanced Workbench
Light at The End of The Tunnel
Alongside the assessment of pricing models, we can investigate other on-chain measures to estimate the sustainability and strength of current market momentum.
Percent Supply in Profit is an insightful metric to track when a market recovery may be underway, transitioning out of a bottom discovery phase (a loss-dominant regime) üü• back towards a healthier equilibrium between profit and loss üüß. This transitional period can be considered active whilst the weekly average of the Percent Supply in Profit resides between 55% and 80%.
The recent rally from $16.9k to $23.1k has shown confluence with the Percent of Supply in Profit abruptly surging from 55% to over 67%. This 12% surge over 14 days has been one of the sharpest spikes in profitability compared to prior bear markets. This provides an indication of how much coin volume transacted and changed hands below $23.3k.
üóúÔ∏è
Workbench Tip
: These colored areas are established using the
if-then
statement, which highlights prices when a particular Percent Supply in Profit value is reached.

Historically, any abrupt change in supply (unrealized) profitability has motivated investors to react, which can be measured using metrics that describe Realized Profit and Loss.
The Realized Profit and Loss metrics measures the difference between the value of coins at the time of disposal and the time of acquisition. The chart below displays the weekly aggregated volume of Realized Profit and Loss alongside the Net Realized Profit and Loss. To compare magnitude across cycles, each trace is normalized by Market Cap.

The current bear, which started in November 2021, has undergone two remarkably large capitulation events, realizing a net loss of ¬†-2.9% and -3.7% of market cap per week, respectively. This regime has now shifted to one of Profit-Dominance, a promising sign of healing after the heavy deleveraging pressures inflicted in the second half of 2022.

An Opportunity For New Investors
When the market is in a prolonged bottom (or top) discovery stage, new investor behavior becomes an influential factor in forming local recovery (or correction) pivot points. We can assess this behavior via the Percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit üîµ.
Interestingly, during bear markets, when > 97.5% of the acquired supply by new investors is in loss üü• the chance of seller exhaustion rises exponentially. Conversely, when > 97.5% of short-term holder supply is in profit, these players tend to seize the opportunity and exit at break-even or profit üü©.
The recent surge to $23K has pushed this metric to > 97.5% in profit for the first time since the ATH in November 2021. Given this substantial spike in profitability, the probability of sell pressure sourced from STHs is likely to grow accordingly.
Live Professional Workbench
Looking at the spending volume of these newer holders through the Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB) (30D-EMA) metric, we can see how this spike in profitability has driven the cohort‚Äôs spending volume well above the long-term declining trend.
Therefore, the sustainability of the current rally can be considered a balance between inflowing and newly deployed demand, meeting the supply drawn out of investor wallets by these higher prices.
Live Advanced Metric
Persistent Conviction
Assessing the profitability and behavior of short-term holders in isolation does not provide a full-scope assessment of the market. Therefore we shall perform the same study but focus on the long-term holder cohort, many of which are 2021-22 investors that remain overwhelmingly underwater on their holdings.
The LTH-MVRV üü† compares the cost-basis of the long-term holder cohort against spot prices, providing insight into the unrealized profit or loss held.
Tracing this metric shows that after 6.5 months, the market price has finally recovered above the long-term holders' cost basis at $22.6k. This denotes that the average LTH is only just above their break-even basis.
Considering the time length of LTH-MVRV traded below 1 üü© and the lowest printed value, the ongoing bear market has been very comparable with 2018-2019 so far.
Live Professional Metric
Despite the recovery from a historically undervalued condition, remarkably, the volume of coins aged more than 6 months (Old-Supply) üîµ has increased by 301k BTC since early December. This divergence highlights the strength of the HODLing conviction via the recent market rally.
In other words, the supply held by HODLers has shifted from a contraction of -314k BTC/month following FTX collapsing, to an expansion at a rate of +100k BTC/month.

Miners Selling into Rally
Similar to the short-term holders, Miners have also taken advantage of the recent price appreciation to shore up their balance sheets.
The Puell Multiple üü† is the ratio between the aggregate miners' daily income (USD-denominated) to their yearly average. It shows that the relative miner revenue has increased by 254% compared to early January, highlighting how immense the financial stress experienced by the industry has been throughout the bear market.
Live Advanced Metric
With a notable recovery in miner USD-denominated revenues, the resulting behavior shift has switched from accumulation of +8.5k BTC/month, to distribution of -1.6k BTC/month. Miners have spent some -5.6k BTC since 8-Jan and have experienced a net balance decline YTD.
Live Professional Workbench
Conclusion
The recent price recovery from the December lows to over $23.2k has significantly improved investor profitability across the board. Consulting the price models, we can see that the recent rally has reclaimed several cost-basis models and pushed the proposition of supply held at a profit into the more favourable territory.
However, higher prices and the allure of profits after an extended bear market tend to motivate supply to re-enter liquid circulation. Analysis of cohort behavior shows that short-term holders and miners have been motivated by the opportunity to liquidate a portion of their holdings.
On the contrary, the supply held by long-term holders continues to grow, which can be argued to be a signal of strength and conviction across this cohort. Given the effect of long-term holders on the macro trend, watching their spending is likely a key toolset to track over the coming weeks."

In this edition, we will explore some of the mechanics underlying this rally within both the derivative markets, and the spot exchanges. We cover:
The recent futures short squeeze and a return of positive futures basis,
despite declining aggregate leverage relative to market size.
The prevailing decline of spot exchange balances,
despite a decreasing dominance of exchange related on-chain activity.
The market breaking above the average withdrawal price

Squeezing Shorts
After a long, painful, and gruelling 2022, the new year has opened with a notable reversal of the downtrend throughout January. As is often the case, such rallies are usually fuelled by some degree of short squeezes within derivative markets, and this rally is no different.
To date, there have been over $495M in short futures contracts liquidated across three waves, notably with declining scale as the rally played out.
Live Professional Chart
We can see the initial short squeeze in mid-Jan took many traders by surprise, setting an all-time-low of 15% for long liquidation dominance (meaning 85% of liquidations were shorts). This is an even larger magnitude relative to the longs liquidated during the FTX implosion (75% long dominance), showing just how offside many traders were.
Live Advanced Chart
Across both perpetual swap, and calendar futures, the cash and carry basis is now back into positive territory, yielding 7.3% and 3.3% annualized, respectively. This comes after much of November and December saw backwardation across all futures markets, and suggests a return of positive sentiment, and perhaps with a side of speculation.

However, despite this return of a positive futures basis, the total open interest relative to the Bitcoin Market cap has been in decline since mid-Nov. The BTC denominated value of open futures contracts has fallen by 36% over this time, dropping from 650k BTC in mid-Nov, to 414k BTC today.
Note that 40% of this decline can be directly attributed to the loss of 95k BTC worth of open interest that was held at the FTX exchange.
Live Advanced Chart
If we compare the notional size of open futures contracts to the BTC balance on corresponding exchanges, we can gauge the relative scale of leverage within the market. Here we can see that this leverage ratio has declined from open interest equal to 40% of spot exchange balances, to just 25% over the last 75-days.
Overall, this reflects a significant net reduction in futures leverage, and a closing out of short speculative interest. It potentially also signals a reduction in short term downside hedge positions. On a relative basis, and alongside the increase in observed shift back towards on-chain self-custody (
WoC 46
), this also puts more emphasis onto spot markets as a key driver of the current market structure.
Live Advanced Chart
Inspecting Spot Exchanges
The trend of coins flowing out from spot exchanges has been a major theme since March 2020, which to this day marks the all-time-high exchange coin balance. Today, the total BTC balance held on the exchanges we track is around 2.251M BTC, representing 11.7% of the circulating supply, and a multi-year low that was last seen in Feb 2018.
Live Advanced Chart
The total volume of coins flowing both in and out of exchanges is currently around $625M/day in both directions (i.e. $1.25B/day total). On net, there is around $20M in net daily flows, reflecting just 1.5% of the total, and showing that exchange flows are in a remarkably even balance. This differs to Nov-Dec where exchanges saw periods of net outflows on the order of $200M to $300M per day.
Live Advanced Chart
The largest monthly outflow of coins in history occurred in this Nov-Dec period, hitting -200k BTC/month in outflows across all exchanges. Today, exchange net-flows have returned to neutral, reflecting a cooling down of outflows. This may signify a slow down in new demand relative to newly mobilized spending (
WoC 4
), now that the market has rallied over 43% year-to-date.
Live Advanced Chart
An Evolving Economy
On-chain transactions for Bitcoin spiked by over 50k transactions per day this week, however we cannot see a corresponding increase in exchange deposits or withdrawal counts. Exchange related transactions represent just 35% of total transaction counts at present, with this dominance remaining in a downtrend since the May 2021 market peak.
This spike in transaction counts is also visible within our
Entity-Adjusted data
, suggesting it is not associated with a single entity, or internal wallet management. This suggests that recent uptick in transaction activity is occurring elsewhere within the Bitcoin economy.
Live Advanced Chart
The USD denominated volume flowing in and out of exchanges has been relatively stable for the past few weeks, however despite this, the relative dominance of exchange related on-chain volume has grown from 2.5% to over 16%.
As we noted in
WoC 3
and
WoC 2
, global transaction volumes for Bitcoin have fallen precipitously since November. This is likely a reflection of a decline in inflated, large size on-chain volumes occurring between Aug-2021 and Nov-2022, due largely to the industry-wide deleveraging, and wallet mismanagement by the FTX/Alameda entity.
Live Advanced Chart
Usually, market strength is accompanied by an increase in total on-chain exchange volumes, as investors and traders become more active. With the above as context, we can see that there remains a negative aggregate momentum within exchange transfer volumes. The monthly average is starting to increase, however it remains well below the yearly baseline at this stage.

Specifically looking to Whale entities, holding over 1k BTC, we can also see an uptick in both deposit and withdrawal volumes to exchanges. Throughout January, Whale entities have contributed between $185M to $215M to total exchange inflows (and outflows), with a net bias of around $25M in net withdrawal volumes.

An Average Acquisition Price
With such large volumes of coins flowing both in, and out of exchanges, we can estimate the average acquisition price for various cohorts of the Bitcoin economy. This first chart models the average acquisition price by yearly class, starting the calculation on the 1-Jan each year, and modelling a sort of long-only DCA cost basis.
Through the 2022 downtrend, only those investors from 2017 and earlier avoided hitting a net unrealized loss, with the class of 2018+ seeing their cost basis taken out by the FTX red candle. The current rally however has pushed the class of 2019 ($21.8k) and earlier back into an unrealized profit.

Workbench Tip

We can create a similar model per exchange, with the chart below showing that recent price action intersected three key cost basis levels:
üü† The all-exchange, all-time withdrawal price was intersected at $16.7k, and provided a form of support during the end of year consolidation range.
üü° + üîµ The average withdrawal price since Jul-2017 for Coinbase and Binance, the two largest exchanges, was just broken through around $21k.
In line with our report last week (
WoC 4
), this can also be seen within metrics like Percent Supply in Profit, which have increased dramatically as prices rise above their on-chain acquisition price.
Live Advanced Chart
Finally, we return to our Whale cohort discussed earlier, however this time reviewing their average acquisition prices since major market bottoms. By starting these traces at market lows, we can assess this cohorts most favourable possible prices.
What we see is that even the average whale, that has been active since the 2017 market üü°, saw their holdings go into an unrealized loss in 2022 as prices broke below $18k. The cohort since the March 2020 lows have an acquisition price of $23.8k, which is sitting immediately above spot prices at the time of writing.
All three of these models demonstrate just how unforgiving the 2022-23 bear market has been, driving cohorts with even the most favourable starting points into an unrealized loss.
Live Professional Chart
Summary and Conclusions
As the end of January approaches, Bitcoin markets have seen the strongest monthly price performance since Oct-2021, fuelled by both historic spot demand, and a sequence of short squeezes. This rally has brought a large portion of the market back into profit, and resulted in futures markets trading at a healthy contango. We also note that initial impulse of exchange outflows, in the aftermath of FTX have calmed to neutral, and are now balanced by newly motivated inflows."

Despite a -6.2% pullback to a weekly low of $22.6k, the average BTC holder is now holding an unrealized profit, with several macro scale on-chain indicators suggesting turning of the market tides is potentially underway.
In this edition, we shall explore this from the lens of spending activity in response to the recent price uptick, considering a wide cross section of the market. The goal is to identify emerging behavioral patterns to gauge shifting macro tides. We shall also investigate whether the incentive to sell is starting to overpower the opportunity cost of HODLing (and how we can identify this shift), as well as the relationship between mature and new participants, as capital begins to change hands.

A Return to Profitability
We shall begin our investigation by analyzing the realized profits locked in by the market during the most recent cycle. We can see a explosion in profit taking after Oct 2020 in response to extraordinary monetary policy. This can be seen to diminish dramatically since the peak in Jan 2021, detoxing over the following two years back to 2020 levels.
An recent resurgence in realized profits can be observed in response to recent price action, however, it remains muted in response to the exuberance experienced throughout the 2021-22 cycle.
Live Advanced Chart
The losses realized by the market over this same time-frame started to expand after Jan 2021, reaching an initial peak on the May 2021 sell-off (
A Bear of Historic Proportions
).
However, it can be seen that the present level of realized losses has declined towards the cycle baseline of around $200M/day, with an overall contraction in loss profile barring explicit capitulation events (e.g. LUNA / FTX).
Live Advanced Chart
Taking ratio between Realized Profits and Losses, we can identify structural changes in dominance between the two. Following the collapse in price action after the Nov 2021 ATH, a regime dominated by losses ensued, driving the Realized P/L Ratio below 1, with increasing severity with each subsequent capitulation in price action.
Nevertheless, we can observe the first sustained period of profitability since the Apr 2022 exit liquidity event, suggesting initial signs of a change in profitability regime.
üîî
Alert Idea:
Realized P/L Ratio (7D-EMA) falling back below 1.0 would indicate a large increase in realized loss dominance, indicating increased spending by investors holding coins with a higher cost basis.
Live Advanced Chart
The Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a metric we can use compare the magnitude of total realized profit and loss as a percentage of the Realized Cap (a measure of network valuation).
From this lens, the combined volume of realized profit and loss remains relatively small compared to the asset size. This indicates that magnitude of spending events remains marginal in scale, especially relative to the euphoria experienced during the bull market, and the FTX capitulation event.
Overall, this suggests that in aggregate, most coins that are on the move were acquired relatively close to the current spot price, and thus are not locking in a large ‚Äòrealized‚Äô payload.
Live Advanced Workbench
Back in the Green
Net Unrealized Profit/ Loss Ratio (NUPL) shows that the recent rally has launched the spot price of Bitcoin above the average acquisition price of the wider market. This puts the market back into a regime of unrealized profit, where the average holder is back in the green.
Comparing the duration of negative NUPL across all past bear markets, we observe a historical similarity between our current cycle (166-days) and the 2011-12 (157-days) and 2018-19 (134-Days) bear markets. The 2015-16 bear market remains a standout with respect to bear market duration, experiencing a regime of unrealized loss nearly twice as long as the runner up (2022-23 cycle).

The ratio between the total unrealized profit held by the market and its yearly average can then ¬†provide a macro scale indicator for a recovering market.
The recent surge in price action has rallied above several aggregate on-chain cost-basis models, resulting in a significant improvement in the market financial position. This momentum metric is now approaching an the equilibrium break point and bears similarity to the recoveries from the 2015 and 2018 bear market years.
Confirmed breakouts above this equilibrium point have historically coincided with a transition in macro market structure. We also note that the length of time elapsed below this equilibrium point has been similar across major bear markets.

Variants of the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metric can be used to inspect the aggregate profit multiple locked in by a variety of market cohorts on any given day.
For the Short-Term Holder cohort üî¥, it can be seen that STH-SOPR is now trading above a value of 1.0 on a sustained basis, displaying the first burst of profit taking since March 2022. This reflects the large volume of coins acquired at lower prices over recent months.
The wider market üîµ has also seen a return to profitable spending, recovering after a very deep and extended period of heavy losses.
Live Professional Workbench
Assessing the Long-Term Holder cohort, we can observe a persistent regime of sustained losses since the LUNA collapse. Despite this cohort continuing to take losses over the last 9 months, there are initial signs of a recovery, with a potential uptrend in LTH-SOPR starting to form.
Live Professional Chart
A Shift in Character
The Adjusted Reserve Risk metric can be used to contextualize the behavior of the HODLer class. This cyclical oscillator quantifies the balance between the aggregate incentive to sell, and the actual expenditure of long dormant coins.
Higher values
indicate both price, and HODLer spending is elevated.
Lower values
indicate both price, and HODLer spending is declining.
A structural change in the trend appears to be underway, as this oscillator continues to approach its equilibrium position (with 55% of all trading days below the current value). This suggests that the opportunity cost of HODLing is decreasing whilst the incentive to sell is increasing.
Previous break-outs above this equilibrium position have historically denoted a transition from a regime HODLing, to one of increasing profit realization, and a rotation of capital from older bear market accumulators, back towards newer investors and speculators.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can add weight to this thesis of capital rotation by inspecting the Realized Cap HODL Waves. Here we have isolated for coins held for 3 months or less, and note two key observations:
The percentage of wealth held by newer holders is increasing, albeit marginally. Since this is a binary system, this indicates that wealth must be transferring from older hands to newer ones.
The depth of this inflection point is very much in line with historical precedence.
Live Advanced Chart
Subsequently, we can employ the
Realized HODL Ratio
to further supplement the above observation. This metric compares this balance of wealth held between between 1-week and 1y-2y old coins, producing a macro scale oscillator.
Higher values
indicate a disproportionate wealth held by new buyers and speculators.
Lower values
indicate a disproportionate wealth held by long-term, higher conviction HODLers.
When assessing the Realized HODL Ratio, both the rate of change and the trend direction are generally of greater importance than the absolute value. Currently, we are witnessing a rounding bottom structure forming, suggesting a net transfer of wealth is taking place, as well as the trend beginning to transition to the upside.
Live Advanced Chart
With this as context, we can introduce a new variation of the RHODL ratio, which compares the wealth held by single-cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-2y) to the youngest Short-Term Holders (1d-3m). This seeks to evaluate the capital rotation turning point across cycle transitions.
Wealth can only leave the 6m-2y cohort by either maturation into a more senior age band, or via the spending of coins, resetting the age of the coin entirely. Currently, we can see a large and sharp inflection point in this RHODL Ratio variant, suggesting a significant and sudden rotation of capital from last cycle‚Äôs Long-Term Holders to a new cohort of buyers.
This market phenomena has been strikingly consistent across prior bear markets, with large inflections in capital rotation signalling a significant change in market character and structure.
Summary and Conclusions
After an extended and savage bear market, marred by consecutive deleveraging events, there are signs that full detox of exuberance has taken place, and a cyclical transition may be underway. Usually these periods are punctuated by a sharp change in aggregate profit and loss dominance, which appears to be taking place.
However, this trend remains young, both from the lens of duration, and of magnitude of realized profit and loss relative to the market size. As previously discussed in the
WoC#45
, the rotation of capital from Long-Term Holders to the Short-Term Holder cohort has been a persistent trend over the last 12-months. This is elegantly reflected in the growing wealth held by the Short-Term Holder cohort, absorbing coins from their Long-Term Holder counterparts who continue to distribute (generally at a loss).
It appears that the market is within a transitional phase, evolving from the late stages of a bear to the beginning of a new cycle. With past cycles as a guide, the road ahead remains an arduous one, with key examples being 2015, and 2019. These transitional periods historically been characterized by an extended macro sideways market, littered with local volatile moves, usually in both directions."

A Decisive Range
With the spot price of Bitcoin breaking above the Realized Price, the market has entered what has historically been a macro transitional phase, generally bounded by two pricing models:
The lower band of this zone is the Realized Price üîµ ($19.8k), corresponding to the average on-chain acquisition price for the market.
The upper band is determined by the Realized Price to Liveliness ratio üü† ($32.7k), a variant of the Realized Price reflecting an ‚Äòimplied fair value‚Äô weighted by the degree of HODLing activity.
Comparing previous periods within the aforementioned range, we note a similarity between the present market, and 2015-16 and 2019 re-accumulation periods.
Live Advanced Workbench
The price rally has paused at a local high of $23.6k. We can inspect investor behaviour at this time by leveraging the Accumulation Trend Score, reflecting the aggregated balance change of active investors over the past 30 days. A higher weight is assigned to larger entities (such as whales and institutional sized wallets), and a value of 1 (purple colors) indicates that a wide cross-section of investors are adding meaningful volumes of Bitcoin to their on-chain balance.
Comparing to previous bear markets, similar rallies out of the bottom discovery phase have historically triggered a degree of distribution, primarily by the entities that accumulated near the lows. The recent rally is no exception (üî¥ D), where this metric has dropped below 0.25.
Accordingly, the sustainability of the prevailing rally will have some dependence on whether these larger entities continue to accumulate (üü¢ A), resulting in the Accumulation Trend Score advancing back towards a value of 1.0.
Live Advanced Chart
We can further inspect the components of the Accumulation Trend Score, to provide granular analysis of various wallet balance cohorts. We observe a shift in the aggregated behavior of investors across all cohorts, from net Accumulation (post FTX capitulation) üü© to Distribution-Neutral ** üüß during recent weeks.
Among all cohorts, the entities owning 1k-10K BTC have recorded the sharpest change in behaviour, moving from net accumulation, to marked distribution üü•.
Live Engine Room
In Between Cost Basis
In general, after the Bitcoin market retraces from an extreme level (such as macro tops or bottoms), the behavior of the most recently active investors tends to become a dominant factor. The chart below shows that price stalled near the cost basis of Old Supply $23.4k (> 6-months üîµ), and has both the Realized Price (üü†) and Young Supply (< 6-months üî¥) sitting below at $19.8k to $20.0k.
Live Advanced Workbench
Zooming into recent buyers, we can estimate their average unrealized profit multiple held by using the Short-Term Holder MVRV. This metric measures the ratio of spot price to their on-chain cost-basis. Using the weekly average of this indicator, we can identify the following observations:
Breaks above 1 puts new investors into an unrealized profit
, which tends to signal a market transition is underway.
Macro tops (and bottoms) continue to be remarkably similar
, with the average unrealized profit multiple of +40% profit signalling tops, and -40% loss signalling bottoms.
Local tops (and bottoms)
are often signalled by the STH-MVRV returning to a central value of 1.0 as investors react to prices returning to their break-even levels.
The possibility of short-term corrections
tend to increase during periods where short-term holders are +20% in money (STH-MVRV = 1.2) or -20% out of money (STH-MVRV = 0.8).
The recent rejection at the $23.6k level resonates with this structure, as the STH-MVRV hit a value of 1.2. Considering the third observation, and in case of further correction, the market returning to $19.8K would indicate a STH-MVRV value of 1.0, and align with a return to the cost basis of the cohort of new buyers, and the Realized Price.
üîî
Alert Idea:
STH-MVRV (7D-SMA) reaching a value of 1.0 would signal price has returned to the average Short-Term Holder cost basis and break even level.
Live Professional Workbench
Positive On-chain Momentum
With the recent emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions on Bitcoin, there has also been a notable uptick in on-chain activity metrics, mostly related to activity, despite a relatively small impact on total supply moved.
The magnitude of wealth moving on a daily basis can be tracked via the 1-day band of Realized Cap HOLD Waves. This metric captures the relative share of USD wealth changing hand on a daily basis.
We can identify periods of elevated demand, and large volumes of wealth changing hands when we observe a substantial increase above the 1.5% to 2.5% level. This latest rally has seen only a modest uptick in this metric, rising from 0.75% to 1.0%.
This indicates that whilst network activity is climbing, it is not yet correlated with a large ‚Äòrevaluing‚Äô of coins that were acquired at higher or lower prices (i.e. low degree of coin volume changing hands).
Live Advanced Chart
There is a much more noteworthy change in the number of both New and Active on-chain Addresses, which track macro changes in network activity. The following analysis compares the monthly moving average üî¥ with the yearly moving average üîµ of these metrics.
The monthly average of the New Addresses joining the network has surpassed the yearly average since the capitulation event triggered by the FTX bankruptcy, which is a constructive sign. This metric has seen a second significant uptick this week, however, the longer-term moving average remains in a sideways trend, indicating this activity uplift remains in its infancy.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also see this slight uptick in Active address momentum, however the macro sideways trend remains largely in a holding pattern.
Live Advanced Workbench
The total non-zero balance addresses however has pushed to a new all-time-high of 44.06M addresses. In aggregate, this demonstrates that there has been a short-term uptick in Bitcoin network usage of late, however it is not necessarily in terms of coin volume moved. The primary source of this activity is due to Ordinals, which instead of carrying a large payload of coin volume, is instead carrying a larger payload of data and new active users.
Live Advanced Chart
A New Competitor in the Fee Market
As a result of this new activity, the Bitcoin network has found a new buyer of blockspace, creating upward pressure on the fee market. Analysis of the fee market is a good gauge of higher demand for blockspace, and tends to manifest during periods of growing overall demand.
Looking at the monthly average of Miners Revenue from Fees, it is evident that this indicator has not yet surpassed the bear market fee floor rate (2.5%) üîµ for a notable period of time.
Live Advanced Chart
The influence of retail sized entities tends to be important for determining the sustainability of market transitions. Here, we can employ another tool to zoom on these investors effect on fee market by observing the weekly average of the Median Transaction Fee paid (denominated in USD). This is a representative metric for smaller transaction fees that are most likely attributed to retail investors.
Reviewing the history of this indicator illustrates that retail investors competition for inclusion in the next block has not yet revived since the market crash after the 2021 ATH.
Live Advanced Chart
The Emergence of Ordinals
Since launching in late January 2023, the new emerging use case of Bitcoin for Ordinals and Inscriptions has inspired a great deal of discussion across the community. As
Casey Rodarmor
, the mind behind this innovation, described it in their
blog
, Ordinals leverage the
Taproot
soft fork, and numbering of satoshis (Serialization) to inscribe data into the witness portion of a Bitcoin transaction.
The effect of this new innovation has seen Taproot adoption and utilization spike to all-time-highs of 9.4% and 4.2% respectively (see our
research piece for more information on adoption vs utilization
).
Live Advanced Chart
The impact of Ordinals on the Mean Block Size is also significant, with the upper range of mean block size increasing from a steady 1.5 to 2.0MB, to between 3.0 and 3.5MB over the last week.
Live Advanced Chart
These larger blocks have stirred healthy discussions concerning the possible long-term effect of
Ordinals
on the Bitcoin blockchain size, initial node sync times, mempool congestion, and the state of the long-term fee market.The effect of Ordinals so far has been the setting a new lower bound transaction fee required for block inclusion. A large influx of low fee paying transactions (0 to 1sat/vbyte) can be seen hitting our mempool in purple üü£.

We can also model out the number of pending blocks required to clear the mempool assuming standard 1MB non-SegWit transactions üî¥, and full Seg-Wit 4MB blocks üîµ. We can again notice a significant difference to the post-FTX period which decayed quickly as the panic settled. With the Ordinals trend, we can actually see gradually growing demand for blockspace, having been maintained over the past week.

Conclusion
The Bitcoin network and asset has experienced numerous narratives, innovations, and events over its volatile 14yr history. The emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions was an unexpected one, and it has manifested as a non-trivial expansion in demand for blockspace, even though it may not be the classic transfer of coin wealth between investors.
This is a new and unique moment in Bitcoin history, where an innovation is generating network activity without a classical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes. This describes a growth in the user base and an upwards pressure on the fee market from usage beyond the typical investment and monetary transfer use cases. Ordinals are a new frontier, and one that we will be studying more deeply over coming weeks, to observing how it affects and manifests in both on-chain network, and investor behavior."

This market strength comes despite persistent pressure coming out of the US regulatory environment related to digital assets.
In this week's edition, we will explore the cooling down of the initial wave of Bitcoin Inscriptions, as the total number of files encoded to the blockchain passes 100k. We will also assess the behavior of Bitcoin Long and Short-Term Holders using a suite of new on-chain tools we released last week, merging on-chain cohorts, realized profit/loss, and exchanges.

The Initial Inscription Wave
February 2023 will likely be remembered for the emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions on Bitcoin, introducing a new way of storing data and thus creating NFTs on the largest, oldest, and most secure blockchain. What is quite interesting about Inscriptions is that they generate on-chain activity, however, with a relatively light coin transfer volume footprint.
The chart below shows that the total number of UTXOs in the set reached a new ATH of 137M. The UTXO count increased at a rate of 117k per month last week, the highest since Dec 2022.
Live Advanced Chart
Taproot usage reached an all-time high, with 8.121% of all spent outputs last week using the newest Bitcoin script-type. As the total number of Inscriptions crossed 100k, we have seen a cooling down of this initial wave of excitement. Taproot script usage has fallen by 65% since this peak, down to 2.872% of spent outputs spent.
Live Advanced Chart
The average block size has also seen a dramatic change, rising from a typical pre-Inscription ceiling of 1.5MB, to between 2.0 and 2.5MB today. This uplift in the average block size is primarily a result of Inscriptions fitting more data within the 'Data Discounted' witness portion of the transaction.

Ordinal Theory and the Rise of Inscriptions
Light on Coin Volume
As noted above, Inscriptions do not require a large volume of BTC to be associated with them, and in fact, most are utilizing around 10k sats (0.00010000 BTC) assigned to the inscription. However, whilst Inscriptions are taking off, so too is Bitcoins price action, and thus the classic market analysis of investor behavior is also needed.
Interestingly, despite an elevation in price action, the volume of transferred coin value remains extremely low. The chart below shows less than 115k BTC/day in total transfer volume (including the spending of the same coin) is attributed to the coins younger than 6-months old. Such low values have only been observed a handful of times throughout history.
Live Advanced Chart
The total supply younger than 6-months has not increased significantly year-to-date, hovering around 4.298M BTC. Since this is a binary system (older/younger than 6m), this broadly indicates that coins older than 6-months are, in the aggregate, extremely dormant at present.
Live Advanced Chart
This can be confirmed by looking at the Old Supply, coins remained dormant for at least 6-months, which is very close to a new ATH of 15M BTC. We have also overlaid the total supply older than 1yr, which did cross to an ATH this week, breaking above 12.913M BTC.
Despite regulatory pressure, and a 50% YTD rally, many old hands are sitting on their hands.
Live Advanced Chart
We can see that older coins are similarly dormant, with less than 4,770 BTC on the move per day, this week. The chart below highlights the past instances with old coin volumes being this low.
Of interest is that since 2016, these instances have been during bear markets and toward the lows of a significant sell-off or correction. This provides a gauge of periods where older hands are unlikely to spend, potentially signalling a perception that the market is oversold, at least in the near term.
Live Advanced Chart
In a newly released Entity-Adjusted variant of the SVAB metric, we can see that just 4.123% of all spent volume is older than 6-months. Key periods where older hands have displayed a similarly subdued tendency for spending are during bear market declines throughout 2018 to 2022.
Live Professional Chart
Visualizing Investor Behavior
On-chain tools are exceptionally powerful for visualizing and modelling investor behavior patterns, both from the lens of holding time (lifespan), and realized profit/loss.
For the Short-Term Holder Cohort (STHs), we can inspect their dominant behavior patterns throughout market cycles using our newly released variant of Dormancy. STH Dormancy reflects the average age (in days) of coins spent by the STH cohort.
Lower values
indicate STHs are spending coins they acquired very recently, and are not HODLing for long periods of time.
This is typically observed in bear markets, as frustration and price depreciation motivate quick sales.
Higher values
indicate STHs are spending coins with a more extended holding period. This is typically seen in bullish impulses,
as expectations of gains encourage investors to hold on a little longer and ride the market swing.
A sharp upwards move in STH-Dormancy suggests this latter condition is in effect, as buyers of the lows take a little off the table.
üîî Alert Idea
:
STH-Dormancy (30D-SMA)
breaking
below
17-days
is a notable decrease in the average age of spent coins, potentially signalling a degree of panic.
Live Professional Chart
We can see this profit-taking behavior in several SOPR variants, which find a degree of support on the neutral value of 1.0. An aSOPR retest of 1.0 during a bullish impulse indicates that profit-taking is slowing (which would otherwise be upwards pressure on the metric), and holders of coins at a loss are also slowing their spending (otherwise downward pressure).
Overall, this signals a reduction in sell-side pressure and a potential return of the 'buy-the-dip' mentality. A convincing SOPR retest and bounce from 1.0, especially on longer-term moving averages (14D or 30D, for example), is often a signal of a shifting market regime.
üéì SOPR is a great example of an 'all-weather' on-chain metric, which can be used in any market conditions. A detailed

We recently released a suite of powerful new metrics designed for our Professional members (
full list here
), and enabling analysis of the Bitcoin market utilizing three powerful concepts in combination:
Cohort Analysis (Long- and Short-Term Holders).
Realized Profit and Loss (for tracking sentiment and capital flows).
Exchanges and Entity-Adjustment (providing our cleanest signal of economic flows).
The chart below shows the relative share of realized profit and loss locked in by the STH cohort, filtered specifically for coins sent to exchanges to best simulate sell-side forces. We can see a decay pattern in relative STH losses towards market cycle lows, as last-gasp speculators are flushed out, and coins transfer to bottom-building buyers, now with a lower cost basis.
Live Professional Chart
As the market recovers from extended bear markets üü¶, these new STH buyers return to profit with gusto as the market rallies well above what is typically a multi-month bottom formation range. The STH cohort is thus almost entirely in profit, resulting in the majority of STH spending being profitable üî¥.
We have seen this explosion in STH profit dominance, indicative of a large proportion of the coin supply having been accumulated below the current price.
Live Professional Chart
On an absolute coin volume basis, STHs still do not appear particularly motivated to send coins to exchanges just yet. Total STH-Exchange volume is oscillating between 15k and 21k BTC/day, a similar range it has been in since June 2021.
Live Professional Chart
Lastly, we turn to the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort, who dominate losses locked in by investors during the darkest periods of bear markets. The chart below shows the gradual increase in LTH loss dominance, as top buyers of the prior cycle are progressively shaken from their position until the final washout. This final capitulation typically peaks near the final bottom of a macro bearish trend and right as the cycle starts to turn around.
Of all realized value on coins sent to exchanges, LTHs in loss have declined dramatically from a cycle peak of 58% in mid-Jan, to 21% today. Similar sharp declines in the metric can be seen in each prior cycle as LTHs find the necessary hope to HODL, once again.
Live Professional Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The initial wave of Inscriptions on Bitcoin has crossed a total of 100k files immutably stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, highlighting a brand new and unexpected source of demand for blockspace. Inscriptions are unique in that they do not require large volumes of BTC to be transferred, despite their value for discerning owners and buyers.
Despite net growth in on-chain activity, and an ATH in total UTXOs, transfer volumes are remarkably subdued, both for Long and Short-Term Holders. Filtering only for coins sent to exchanges, we can also see that several indicators point to a turning of the cycle and a marked shift in investor behavior patterns."

After slightly loosing ground for the major part of the week, ETH prices consolidated around $1650 on the weekend, rising above pre-FTX-collapse levels.
In this week's edition, we take a look at the renewed interest within the NFT space, driven by the latest developments surrounding the upcoming NFT marketplace and aggregator, Blur, and its direct challenge to industry leader OpenSea. We analyze the effects of the Blur airdrop on OpenSea's market dominance, and assess the sustainability of Blur's user acquisition. We also consider whether Blurs' strategy and focus on pro traders has the potential to cause a paradigm shift for the NFT industry. Furthermore, we evaluate to what degree the renewed interest in NFTs is fostering Ethereum's network activity, and whether it is strong enough to reignite adoption.

Markets Unimpressed by Regulators
After the downfall of FTX, US regulators have increased their scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges. On 8-Feb, the US-based exchange Kraken reached a settlement with the SEC over its staking-as-a-service product. As a result, the exchange immediately suspended staking services for US citizens.
Shortly after, on 13-Feb, ¬†stablecoin issuer Paxos declared it would halt minting of BUSD on 21-Feb amid regulatory pressure coming from the New York State Department of Financial Services. BUSD holders responded quickly by migrating over to other stablecoins while having ¬†a clear preference for USDT. Since 8-Feb, BUSD has declined by more than 31.2%, seeing over $5.052B in redemptions.
Live Advanced Chart
Prior to the Paxos announcement, BUSD had achieved an 11% dominance within the $136 billion stablecoin market. Since then, Tether has gained in relative supply dominance, now holding a 54% market share. DAI has still not gained appreciable market share, nor been able to successfully promote itself as the preferred decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative, despite recent events.
Live Advanced Chart
Gas Prices on the Rise Again
Median transaction gas prices have been consistently low over the past nine months, ranging between 10 to 20 Gwei. This translates to an average of $0.50 for a standard transaction and around $2.00 for a smart contract interaction, a fraction of the triple-digit numbers we saw during the past bull cycle. Low gas costs indicate low demand for blockspace and therefore little usage of Ethereum's applications, which is typical during bear markets.
Since the beginning of this year, however, we can observe a gradual but sustained increase in gas costs. Gas prices are currently sitting at 38 Gwei, exceeding the gas cost spikes we saw during this bear market around events such as the FTX collapse and the Binance bank run. The incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway.
Live Chart
Interest in NFTs Reawakens
Upon closer examination of the gas usage by transaction chart, we can determine that a primary source of this increasing network activity is the NFT market, which is once again showing signs of growth.
After a steep decline in user activity towards the end of 2022, total gas consumption by NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two consecutive months. This suggests that activity around NFTs is approaching levels seen during the NFT Boom.
For an in-depth explanation of why we prefer quantified gas consumption as a measurement tool for network activity refer to:
A Short History of the Etherverse
While initially this rise in interest in NFTs is attributed to the launch of new collections by some of the industry‚Äôs largest players such as Yuga Labs, Doodles, and Moonbirds, a deeper inspection shows that gas demand during the past two weeks has been mainly driven by the developments surrounding the Blur Airdrop.
Live Advanced Chart
Blur comes after OpenSea
Launched in October 2022, Blur, an NFT marketplace and aggregator, quickly gained traction and has since been nipping at the heels of industry leader OpenSea. As of today, Blur has seized a 78% market share of the NFT transfer volume, having overtaken OpenSea following its airdrop on February 14th. Blur aims to be a professional trading platform for NFTs, featuring a zero trading fee model and optional royalty payments.
While the token has lost roughly 13% in value over the past week, the airdrop brought new attention to the upstart rival. As a result, Blur‚Äôs market share jumped by 34%, reducing OpenSea's share from 36% to 15%. ¬†In an attempt to counter its upstart rival, OpenSea made a bold move in restructuring their fee model and policies, however, was still unable to retain its market share:
We‚Äôre making some big changes today:
1) OpenSea fee ‚Üí 0% for a limited time
2) Moving to optional creator earnings (0.5% min) for all collections without on-chain enforcement (old & new)
3) Marketplaces with the same policies will not be blocked by the operator filter
‚Äî OpenSea (@opensea)
February 17, 2023
The limited impact of OpenSea's countermove can be attributed to the differences in the platform‚Äôs user bases. OpenSea has historically attracted creators and collectors, while Blur targets professional traders. With its token rewards, Blur has successfully enhanced market depth on its platform by incentivizing users to post bids, with the ultimate goal of increasing NFT sales frequency and improve the NFT trading and liquidity experience.
Due to the uniqueness of NFTs, quantifying their liquidity solely based on trading volume in relation to the total number of assets may be misleading. Therefore, examining the daily sales frequency per unique user can provide a more accurate measure of the turnover rate. For non-fungible assets, this eventually describes the rate at which individual vendors are finding buyers that are willing to purchase any NFT from the collection, and at what price.
In that regard Blur is clearly leading the race with between 4 or 5 trades per user on a daily base, while OpenSea sees on average of two daily trades per user. A higher sales frequency can create a flywheel effect, since more NFT sellers feel confident listening on Blur‚Äôs platform, creating a larger offering, which in turn attracts more buyers.
Although OpenSea's decision to reduce fees and royalties was a response to pressure from its competitors, it could lead to a paradigm shift in the NFT market. As the two main marketplaces shift their focus from creators and collectors, towards traders, value creation for NFTs may also change, potentially turning these collector's items into a new iteration on the asset class.
Since NFTs have historically derived their value from more subjective criteria such as traits, rarity, and community, price discovery has been difficult and often times been affected by market manipulation. Market making and higher frequency for NFT trading may increase market efficiency, and let NFTs be traded closer to their perceived value.
A look at the sale size of both marketplaces indicates that Blur's approach also facilitates a more profitable sales environment, with sale sizes ranging between 0.3 to 1.3 ETH. Sales on OpenSea for comparison have been constant, with an average of around 0.2 ETH for many months. Note that with non-fungible tokens, sale size does not solely represent better profitability for NFT vendors but can also root from a generally higher-priced offerings on Blur's marketplace. This again speaks to the success of the platform's market strategy, and target audience.
Little Effect on Ethereum
The recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for blockspace, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559. However, this has yet to have an appreciable impact on network adoption. While there has been an expansion in total on-chain activity and growth, the number of new addresses is still 40% lower than this time last year, and the monthly average üî¥ remains below the yearly üîµ, signalling negative momentum.
The latest interest in NFTs appear to primarily appeal to existing users, and are as yet, unable to attract new users to the Ethereum network. This also suggests that both NFT marketplaces discussed above, and indeed most protocols, are fighting over the same preexisting user base of crypto-natives.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
With Blur's user acquisition strategy and focus on incentivizing liquidity, it has achieved a degree of success in attracting traders, beyond the initial airdrop hype. The marketplace is on its potentially way to becoming a serious player in the NFT industry. With the platform recently announcing a second airdrop, this time rewarding users for loyalty, it remains to be seen if it can retain this newly acquired user base.
The increased competition and shift of focus in the NFT market is clearly in favor of NFT traders, who benefit from lower fees, increased liquidity, and better price discovery. Meanwhile, creators may feel disadvantaged due to the cutting down on royalty enforcement throughout the industry.
The renewed interest in NFTs, however, has not yet attracted new users, or triggered significant new capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem. Nevertheless, depending on the level of future NFT trading activities, it can still result in net value creation for the Ethereum network, with potentially higher MEV rewards and arbitrage opportunities, and the build out of new infrastructure for the future."

Market Contests with Cost Basis
In addition to traditional technical indicators, pricing models founded on on-chain principles can be powerful tools for estimating supply and demand boundaries.
Among various on-chain valuation models, the average acquisition price of various cohorts in the Bitcoin economy provides an estimation of price ranges which are psychologically important. The chart below compares these cost basis estimates (Realized Price) across three cohorts:
üî¥
Young Supply Realized Price ($21.0k)
, which is the average price of coins that have changed hands in the last ~6 months.
üü†
Market Realized Price ($19.8k)
, which is the average price of all coin holders.
üîµ
Old Supply Realized Price ($23.5k)
, which is the average acquiring cost of coins held for at least ~6 months.
We can see that this week, spot prices were rejected from levels coincident with the Old Supply Realized Price. Many of these older coins are held by 2021-22 cycle buyers, who are underwater in their position.
üîî
Alert Idea:
Price breaking above $23.5k would reflect a rally above the Old Supply Realized Price, putting the average holder in all cohorts back into profit.
Live Advanced Workbench
In addition to the time cohorts, investor behavior can also be assessed based on wallet size cohorts. Among all well-known entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem, Whales (holding over 1k BTC) are always often the centre of speculators‚Äô attention.
The chart below outlines the average acquisition prices for the whale cohort considering only coins flowing in and out of exchanges. The traces start measuring at the following major market bottoms, seeking to provide the most favourable average Whale acquisition price for each cycle era.
üü° Since July 2017 , the launch of Binance
üî¥ Since December 2018, at the cycle low of the 2018 bear market.
üîµ March 2020 at the bottom of the COVID sell-off.
All three Whale sub-groups saw their holdings go into an unrealized loss when the market plunged below ~$18k in early November 2022. Remarkably, the recent recovery stalled at the approximate cost basis of the Dec-2018+ era whales üî¥ ($23.8k), coincident with the Old Supply Realized Price.

Live Professional Workbench
The current state of the market can be reasonably described as resembling a
Transitional Phase,
typically occurring in the later stages of a bear market. This assertion can be observed in the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metric (NUPL).
Since mid-January, the weekly average of NUPL has shifted from a state of net unrealized loss to a positive condition. This indicates that the average Bitcoin holder is now holding a net unrealized profit of magnitude of approximately 15% of the market cap. This pattern resembles a market structure equivalent to transition phases in previous bear markets üüß.
We can also account for lost coins by subtracting the unrealized profit locked in the 7yr+ old portion of the supply, returning an adjusted variation of this metric (aNUPL) üîµ. By this measure, the market is only barely below break-even, and it could be argued is still within a bear market territory.

A Nudge in the Right Direction
A classic sign of growing adoption within a constructive transition phase is the attraction and inflow of new capital to the market. We can further explore this change in momentum through the lens of Transfer Volume, which tends to fluctuate with the aggregate level of capital in the market.
The metric below compares the monthly average üî¥ transfer volume against the yearly average üîµ to underline relative shifts in dominant sentiment and help identify when the tides are turning for network activity.
Since early January, the monthly Transfer Volume has increased by 79% to $9.5B per day. However, this remains significantly below the yearly average, although this longer-term average is heavily influenced by an unfortunately large amount of FTX/Alameda-related wash volumes (as noted in
WoC 3
).
üîî
Alert Idea
: Transfer Volume [USD] (30D-SMA) breaking above ~$36B would signal return of strong capital tides.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can supplement this observation with a similar momentum chart related specifically to on-chain exchange volumes, as investors and traders typically become more active as capital enters. By this metric, we can observe a much closer monthly and yearly average, with momentum starting to rise. The monthly average for exchange flows has increased by 34% since early January, however, it remains below the yearly average of $1.64B per day.
üîî
Alert Idea
: Exchange Inflow or Outflow Volume [USD] (30D-SMA) breaking above $1.6B/day would signal positive momentum in exchange-related flows, back above the yearly baseline.
Live Advanced Workbench
Taking Profits
As more coin volumes start to move around the network, we can consult the aSOPR metric to assess the average profit (or loss) realized by transactors. The 14d average of aSOPR is now trading above a value of 1.0 on a sustained basis for 40 days so far üü©.
This pattern underlines the first sustained burst of profit-taking since March 2022, and reflects a non-trivial return of inflowing capital sufficient to adsorb the profits taken.
The return of aSOPR trading above 1.0 on a sustained basis is a typical characteristic as the market recovered from a period of deep and extended losses.
Live Advanced Metric
By calculating the ratio between realized profits and losses, we can confirm that profitability has shifted back toward a transition phase. A profit-dominated regime began in mid-January, driving the Realized P/L Ratio above 1.
Interestingly, there is an observable upper threshold for Realized P/L Ratio at around 2.0, which tends to act as a resistance level in bear markets, as profit-taking overwhelms weak demand. Crossing this threshold may provide a more robust indicator for growing capital inflows.
üîî
Alert Idea
: ¬†Realized P/L Ratio (14D-EMA) crossing above 2.0 may indicates a sustained inflow of new capital is absorbing profit taking. Conversely, falling back below the 1.0 indicates that realized losses are dominant again, potentially indicating weakening sentiment.
Live Advanced Metric
Dissecting Selling Side
Zooming in on the recent market rally, we can see that the share of supply held by new investors, which is now in profit, surged from around 2.5% (bear market baseline) to more than 15%. This pattern is reminiscent of the previous recovery from the 2018-19 bear low üü¶, and provides a view into the volume of coins which changed hands in recent months.
Live Professional Metric
We can also gauge the influence of these new investors by observing the volume sent to exchanges which was either in profit or in the loss. Here we can see the following:
1- The ratio of Short-Term volume in profit vs loss sent to exchanges peaked at 2.75x in early Feb, equivalent to the October 2022 ATH.
2- The total volume of STH coins sent to exchanges today is around 16k BTC per day and split approximately 50:50 in Profit: Loss.
Relatively speaking, this remains a relatively low total coin volume sent to exchanges compared to the 2020-23 cycle.
Live Professional Workbench
Finally, we can assess the Short-Term Holder MVRV to estimate the relative unrealized profit held by STHs. As discussed in
WoC 07
, the possibility of STHs taking profits tends to grow during periods where the average STH is 20%+ in money, returning a STH-MVRV above 1.2.
The recent rejection at the $23.8k level resonates with this structure, as the STH-MVRV hit a value of 1.2 before stalling. Should the market return to $19.3k, it would bring STH-MVRV back to the value of 1.0, and indicate that spot prices have returned to the cost basis of this cohort of new buyers.
üîî
Alert Idea
: STH-MVRV (7D-SMA) reaching a value of 1.0 would signal price has returned to the average Short-Term Holder cost basis and break even level.
Live Advanced Workbench
Conclusion
The Bitcoin economy often reacts not only to levels widely observed in traditional technical analysis but also the psychological cost basis levels of various investor cohorts printed on-chain. This takes place not only with respect to their realized price but also regarding the degree of profit and loss held within their supply.
From this lens, the market currently resides in a transitional phase, bounded above by the Realized Price of Older Supply and also by the average Whale that has been active since the 2018 cycle bottom. We have seen an initial wave of capital inflow into the space, observable through profit-taking. However, this capital wave is still infant in scale and remains historically light in total coin volume on the move."

In just a few short days, three primary banking institutions in the US, all of which serviced firms within the industry, entered voluntary liquidation, or were taken into receivership by US regulators.

on the matter.
For all three institutions, it is expected that full deposits will be returned, whether by reserves held, or via FDIC and US regulators deposit guarantees.

Net capital outflows from the digital asset market, observable across both stablecoins, and the two majors, BTC and ETH.
Cyclical lows hit in futures open interest, despite elevated trade volumes, and speculative interest leading to an explosive rally back to $22k for BTC, and $1.6k for ETH.

Bitcoin prices find themselves trading between several popular, and widely observed technical analysis pricing models. After finding resistance at the 200-week and 365-day moving average (~25.0k) in Feb, prices visited and then rallied off the 200-day and 111-day average (~$19.8k) this week.
Noting that this is the first cycle in history where BTC have traded below the 200-week MA, the market is in new territory from this perspective.
Live Advanced Chart
For the first time since the collapse of the LUNA-UST project, we have also seen volatility in stablecoin prices this week, driven by fears of USDC being partially un-backed. USDC traded down to a low of $0.88, followed closely by DAI at $0.89, with the latter a result DAI's approximately 65.7% backing by stablecoin collateral.
Both Gemini's GUSD, and Paxos' USDP deviated slightly below their $1 peg, whilst BUSD and Tether saw prices trade at a premium.
Tether in particular saw a premium emerge of between $1.01 and $1.03 for much of the weekend. It is somewhat ironic that Tether would be seen as a safe haven amidst fears of a wider contagion sourced from the heavily regulated US banking sector.
Live Advanced Chart
In the case of DAI, stablecoins have become the dominant form of collateral backing it, with this trend growing consistently since mid 2020. USDC accounts for approximately 55.5% of direct collateral, as well as a significant share of the various Uniswap liquidity positions used, in sum representing around 63% of all collateral.
This event certainly opens up discussions regarding longer-term implications for DAI, which is a purportedly decentralized stablecoin. This event however demonstrates how intimately linked DAI's price to the traditional banking system via the collateral mix (which also includes an additional 12.4% in tokenized real world assets).
As we
reported in mid-2022
, Tether dominance within the stablecoin market had been in a structural decline since mid-2020. However, with recent regulatory moves against BUSD, and this week's concerns related to USDC, Tether dominance has climbed back above 57.8%.
USDC has maintained a dominance between 30% and 33% since October 2022, however it remains to be seen whether supply decreases as the redemption window re-opens on Monday. BUSD has seen a dramatic decline in recent months, with issuer Paxos ceasing new minting, and dominance falling from 16.6% in November, to just 6.8% today.

Aggregate Capital Outflows
Estimation of the true capital inflows and outflows into the digital asset market can be tricky, however in most instances, capital initially flows in via the two majors (BTC and ETH), or via stablecoins. Thus, the combination of the Realized Cap for BTC and ETH, and the circulating supply of major stablecoins provides a fairly robust measure.
Here, we can see that the total market has a value of around $677B by this method, down around 20% from the ATH of $851B set one year ago. BTC commands a dominance of 56.4%, ETH of 24.5% and 17.9% in USDT, USDC, and BUSD, and the remaining 1.2% in LTC.
Live Advanced Chart
On a 30-day change basis, February was the first net capital inflow into the industry since April 2022, peaking at +$5.8B/month, and primarily led by BTC and ETH. The last month however, the market has seen a reversal outflow of -$5.97B, with 80% of that a result of stablecoin redemption (BUSD primarily), and 20% from realized losses across BTC and ETH.
Live Advanced Chart
As the news of the Silicon Valley Bank failure hit, investors sought refuge in BTC and ETH, with notable outflows occurring across exchanges we monitor. Approximately 0.144% of all BTC, and 0.325% all ETH in circulation was withdrawn from exchange reserves, demonstrating a similar self-custody response pattern to the
FTX collapse
.
Live Advanced Chart
On a USD basis, the last month saw over $1.8B in combined BTC and ETH value flow out of exchanges. This is not necessarily large in relative scale, however observing net exchange withdrawals, especially within the current hostile regulatory environment, does speak to a degree of investor confidence that is worth noting.
Live Advanced Chart
The two major stablecoins on the other hand have seen net inflows to exchanges on the order of $1.8B to $2.3B per month. It is important to note that this is more than counterbalanced by BUSD flowing out of exchanges at an eye-watering rate of -$6.8B/month. Thus it is likely that there is a degree of 'stablecoin switching' taking place.
However, overall, it appears to be a stablecoin in, BTC and ETH out response from the market, reflecting a remarkable appreciation for self-custody of trustless assets.
Live Advanced Chart
Flushing Futures
Lastly, we will assess the response expressed through futures markets. This week has seen total open interest fall to cyclical, and multi-year lows for the two major assets. Bitcoin futures positions have a notional value of $7.75B, and represent around 63% of the total open interest.
Live Professional Chart
For futures trading volume, Bitcoin dominance is similar at around 60%, and volumes have picked back up after the post-FTX and end of year lull. Total trade volume is approximately $58.2B/day, and equivalent to levels seen throughout 2022.
Live Professional Chart
The volatile price action this week was in part fuelled by a series of both long and short squeezes. On the sell-off to $19.8k, approximately $85M in BTC long positions were liquidated. This was followed by around $19M in short positions flushed out on the recovery back above $22k.
Live Professional Chart
In the lead up to this rally, funding rates in perpetual swap markets entered an extreme level of backwardation. Traders were paying annualized funding rates of -27.1% and -48.9% to be short BTC and ETH, respectively. Traders were also much heavier short ETH, with the BTC:ETH spread hitting 21.8%, the largest since the FTX sell-off.
Live Professional Chart
This exacerbated liquidations in ETH futures markets. Over $48M in shorts were liquidated on the market recovery back above $1.6k, which represents 2.5x more notional value forced closed relative to BTC.
This suggests that ETH markets are being utilized more heavily for expressing speculative interest of late, exacerbating volatility.
Live Professional Chart
We will close with a final chart which overlays the on-chain response of Short-Term Holders (STHs), with the response in leveraged futures markets. The chart presents STH-SOPR minus 1 üîµ, plotted over the annualized futures funding rate üü†, with the following findings:
By our defined age threshold of 155-days, almost all STH coins are likely in profit, with the exception of those who acquired near the local highs.
STH-SOPR (minus 1) returned a value of -3.8%, which is a relatively large realized loss, and suggests local 'top buyers' dominate spending at present.
The direction and performance of STH-SOPR tends to correlate with that of funding rates. Both metrics reflect a different, but meaningfully large sub-set of the BTC market, with one representing spot/on-chain, and the other leveraged futures.
With this as context, it appears as though the majority of coins spent this week were local top buyers realizing a loss (other holders are relatively dormant). This occurred just before futures entered a steep backwardation, and traders opened speculative short positions.
As news of bank deposits being guaranteed broke, a powerful rally pushed BTC back above $22k, and ETH above $1.6k, catching much of the market off-guard.
Live Professional Chart
Summary and Conclusions
After one of the most consequential weeks of 2023, the digital asset industry is short three crypto friendly banking institutions in the US, and finds itself within an increasingly hostile regulatory environment. With traditional financial markets closed over the weekend, several stablecoins experienced a deviation from the $1 peg, recovering as news of guaranteed deposits filtered through on Sunday.
The response from investors has been somewhat similar to the post-FTX environment, with a net transfer of stablecoins into exchanges, and instead taking custody of BTC and ETH. However at the wider scale, the industry has experienced a net capital outflow of approximately $5.9B over the last month.
The industry, and indeed global financial system remains in uncharted waters. In many ways this week reinforces the very reasons why Satoshi created a trustless, scarce, digital asset in the first place."

Only 124-trading days in history have seen a larger 7-day upside rally, with just 16-days occurring from 2015 onwards. Almost all instances have occurred within bull market trends, albeit typically near the later stages of the run.
The strong out-performance from BTC comes alongside challenging conditions for the traditional financial and banking system. Concerns remain elevated regarding the vulnerability of smaller banks in an era of digital bank runs, and new liquidity funding facilities are being established between the US Federal Reserve, US banks, and swap lines with other Central Banks.
With this as our backdrop, we will explore how investors are reacting on-chain, and demonstrate via several methods how the Bitcoin market appears to be shifting gears, out of deep bear market territory, and towards a structure resembling past early bull markets. We will analyse Bitcoin from the following angles:

üí® Momentum On-chain
We will start by observing the on-chain activity space, where a simple concept of 'more is better', generally applies. As more people interact and transact within the Bitcoin economy, it is typically associated with periods of increasing adoption, network effects, and investor activity.
The monthly average of transaction counts has hit 309.5k/day this week, which is the highest level since April 2021, and a significant break above the yearly average.
Fewer than 12.2% of all days have seen more transaction activity for Bitcoin, a healthy sign

As a result, network congestion is climbing, putting upwards pressure on transaction fees. Bolstered by a new demand from
Ordinals and Inscriptions
, the 2yr Z-Score for miner revenue from fees has turned positive.
Elevated fee pressure is a common precursor to more constructive markets, coincident with new waves of adoption, expressed via increasing demand for blockspace.
Live Advanced Chart
Miners are of course key beneficiaries of this influx, seeing their total revenue spike up to $22.6M/day. This week, miner revenues have lifted to the highest level since June 2022, breaking convincingly above the yearly average.
Similar to the activity models above, this is typically observed near transition points towards a more constructive market.

üìñ New Research: Shrimp Supply Sink
The supply distribution of Bitcoin continues to be a topic of great interest, for analysis of capital flows, and also for observing behaviors of investor cohorts. In this piece, we break down the BTC supply by wallet size, explore how coins disperse over time, and demonstrate how smaller holders have continued to grow their share of the Bitcoin pie.
The Shrimp Supply Sink: Revisiting the Distribution of Bitcoin Supply
‚öôÔ∏è Shifting Up A Gear
As we explored in early Feb (
WoC 6
), several on-chain indicators have been transitioning from conditions typical of deep bear markets, and back towards more neutral, and constructive territory. MVRV is one such metric, modelling the unrealized profit multiple held within the coin supply.
The chart below shows that MVRV has traded up to 1.36, which sits between the all-time-average of 1.82, and the 'oversold' -1 standard deviation level. Historically, Bitcoin has traded within this middle ground band for 54% of all trading days, both during late stage bears, as well as early bull market recoveries.
üîî
Alert Idea:
MVRV
breaking above
1.82
would
signal a return to the all-time-average, which has historically defined the boundary between early-to-late bull and bear markets.
Live Advanced Chart
Given MVRV is a ratio derived from the Realized Price, we can back-calculate a pricing level that would correspond with these key MVRV levels. With BTC prices breaking above $27k this week, the market is now trading within the neutral zone of ¬±0.5 standard deviations from the long term mean.
This indicates that BTC prices are no longer heavily discounted relative to the average on-chain market cost basis.
Live Advanced Chart
The MVRV Momentum Oscillator is a powerful tool to identify these macro phase shifts, and it is currently in the process of breaking above 0.
This indicator is very responsive to events where large proportions of the coin supply are
acquired above, or below the spot price
, and quickly revert to holding an unrealized loss, or profit respectively (i.e. near cycle inflection points).
MVRV Momentum has just flipped positive, signalling that a large proportion of the coin supply was acquired below the current price, and is now back in profit. Similar to the metrics above, past instances of positive flips tend to also correlate with upticks in network adoption and on-chain activity.

üßä Following the Cold Money
One of the more powerful tools within on-chain analysis is our ability to monitor the holding time of coins, called Lifespan. This allows us to identify when older coins, typically held by longer-term, high conviction HODLers are on the move.
The chart below shows the proportion of USD wealth held in 'hot coins', defined as coins that transacted within the last 7-days. This metric primarily increases when old coins are spent and take profits, transferring cheap and old coins, to new buyers at expensive prices.
Whilst there has been an slight uptick in the proportion of 'hot coins', it remains close to cycle lows, once again similar to transitional periods following significant bearish trends. This indicates that despite the strong price performance, it still insufficient to motivate most owners of older coins to take profits.
Live Advanced Chart
We can see this in Long-Term Holder SOPR, which is in the process of returning to neutral territory. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are largely buyers from the 2020-22 cycle, and they have been locking in losses for almost 12 consecutive months.
The monthly average of LTH-SOPR is currently breaking above the yearly average, suggesting a return of both confidence, and a return of positive momentum in their spending patterns.
Live Professional Chart
Finally, taking a view over the entire market, we revisit several SOPR variants, which is a metric we also covered in last weeks edition (
WoC 11
). SOPR is an all-weather metric which can be used to track the degree of profit and loss realized by market cohorts.
Here we have overlaid four SOPR variants:
üü¢
SOPR
- covering spending behavior of the entire network.
üîµ
Adjusted SOPR
- filtering out non-economical relay transactions (< 1hr lifespan).
üü†
Entity-Adjusted SOPR
- our cleanest filtering for the most economically meaningful spending activity across the whole network.
üî¥
Short-Term Holder SOPR
- filtering only for coins acquired within the last 155-days.
We note a similar recovery structure to the 2018-19 cycle is currently underway. A healthy 'wash-out' event took place last week, with all SOPR variants undercutting a level of 1.0. This indicates a widescale realized loss event during the sell-off the $19.8k.
This week however, has followed up with the highest SOPR print since the Nov 2021 ATH, suggesting that whilst profits are undoubtedly being taken, it has yet to put brakes on the prevailing uptrend.

Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin investors have experienced one of the strongest one-week gains on record, amidst a backdrop of stress, consolidation, and liquidity injections across the global banking system. Several on-chain indicators suggest that the Bitcoin market is transitioning out of conditions historically associated with deep bear markets, and back towards and greener pastures.
Adoption on-chain is accelerating higher, and the majority of coin holders who have weathered volatility for over 5-months remain largely firm handed. Few longer-term investors appear to be motivated to take profits into this rally, signalling a remarkable strength, and a reflection of the beliefs held about Bitcoin's important role in the future of the global financial system."

Taking Chips Off the Table
In response to the strong price appreciation over recent weeks, investors have increased the volume of coins deposited to exchanges. Net exchange flows ticked higher by approximately 4.18k BTC this week, the largest net increase since LUNA collapsed in May 2022.
This suggests a degree of profit taking is underway, as investors take chips off the table. Prior instances with similar or larger net inflows over the last cycle, have all aligned with major market volatility events, usually to the downside.
Live Advanced Chart
We can also assess the breakdown of coins sent exchanges by either Long-Term or Short-Term holders, allowing us to explore which cohorts are taking profits. Both groups have seen an uptick in coins sent to exchanges, peaking at a total of 31k BTC this week.
Short-Term Holders in dominate 92.5% of total inflow volumes
, with 65% of the total being STH coins in profit.
Long-Term Holders account for just 7.5% of the total deposit volume
, however 80% of their volume is in profit, the largest uptick since mid-2021.
Live Professional Workbench
In aggregate, a total of $320M/day in net profits have been locked in by the market on spent coins. This is the largest net profit taking since May 2022, right before the LUNA-UST project collapsed. We note that the magnitude of realized profits still remains well below typical bull market levels.
It is also apparent that the severity of net losses has also been decaying since July 2022. This reinforces our observations from last week (
WoC 12
) that the market appears to have returned to a more neutral gear, and resembles a more transitional market structure.
Live Advanced Workbench
Measuring realized profit/loss is a powerful technique in on-chain analysis, enabled by Pricestamping coins when they move on-chain. From this, we can compare the magnitude of profit locked in over the last month, to the yearly average. Here, we can see that we have the first positive momentum cross-over since the Oct-Nov 2021 ATH.
This tool intuitively indicates periods of heavy, or light profit taking in bullish, or bearish markets, respectively. In particular, note the overall shape of the yearly moving average for Realized Profits, which trends up in bulls, and down in bears.
We will take this observation into our next related and similarly powerful topic of Lifespan.
Live Advanced Workbench
Tracking Time
In the prior section, we observed how exchange flows can be related to the degree of profit realized by various on-chain cohorts. We can also supplement this with another suite of tools under the category of Lifespan. Rather than measuring the change in value change of a coin to obtain profit/loss, we instead measure how much holding time is spent between coin acquisition, and disposal.
When we observe heavy Lifespan destruction, it usually means a large volume of older coins are on the move, helping us identify periods where longer-term, and more experienced investors are exiting.
Our first port of call is to assess the macro landscape via the Liveliness metric. This metric elegantly defines the ratio between all-time Lifespan Destruction, and Creation.
Liveliness will trend down
when the market prefers to accumulate and HODL coins, building a reservoir of Lifespan, and
suggesting confidence in the asset
.
Liveliness will trend higher
when the market prefers to distribute old coins, and expend the reservoir of Lifespan,
suggesting the asset is considered expensive
.
Live Advanced Chart
Recalling the shape of the Yearly average of Realized Profits, we can see a very similar shape and relationship exists with Liveliness, largely since they describe similar market behaviors:
During bull markets
, longer-term investors spend long dormant coins and realized large profits. This eventually leads to an oversupply and setting a macro market top.
During bear markets
, longer-term investors return to a slow accumulation strategy, and there are fewer profits taken day to day. This eventually establishes a cycle floor.
At present, we can see both metrics remain in macro downtrends, suggesting the majority of coins remains inactive on-chain.
Live Advanced Chart
The principle metric for measuring Lifespan is Coindays Destroyed (CDD), which reflects the volume of 'investor holding time' that is spent each day. Over the last cycle, we can generally describe upticks in CDD in two categories:
Sustained uptrends during bull markets
reflecting a consistent distribution pressure as long-term holders take profits.
Sharp peaks during high volatility events
, typically observed in bear market sell-offs. These reflect periods of widespread panic, as investors spend coins in the face of high volatility.
In recent weeks, a modest uptick in CDD can be observed, however, the magnitude of destruction remains well below typical bull market levels. This indicates that the average spent coin is still relatively young, aligning with our observation that Short-Term Holders dominate profit taking at present.
Live Advanced Chart
A useful tool to compare this across cycles is Binary CDD, which converts the CDD metric into a result of one if the magnitude exceeds a long-term average (returns zero if not). Here we have also smoothed the trace with a 7-day average to create an oscillator.
From this perspective, profit taking by long-term holders in bull markets becomes extremely apparent, highlighted as sustained periods of red and orange. In our current market however, we remain firmly within a quiet patch, typical of bearish markets, early bulls, and the transitional period in between.
Live Advanced Workbench
The recent uptick in CDD is quite visible when broken down across the LTH and STH cohorts. Despite Long-Term Holders contributing the least to spent coin volume, their holding time is much longer, and thus they tend to have an outsized influence on Lifespan metrics.
By this measure, the recent profit taking is also fairly modest, and has not yet established a sustained uptrend in CDD.
Live Professional Workbench
Zooming into Short-Term Holders, the average age of a spent STH coin has also increased, effectively doubling from ~10-days in the months leading up to the FTX failure, up to 21-days today. This adds further evidence to the argument that the Short-Term Holder cohort, who accumulated BTC near the cycle lows, are the primary participants behind recent profit taking.
It also suggests that STHs are increasingly willing to wait for longer periods, suggesting a degree of confidence in the prevailing market trend.
Live Professional Chart
The Value of Time
Finally, we can bring Lifespan into the price domain, drawing on our
prior research
developing the Value Days Destroyed Multiple (VDDM). This metric compares the monthly dollar value of CDD to its yearly average.
Currently, we can see that the VDDM value is accelerating out of a long period trading around cycle lows. This indicates that the CDD value destruction in response to recent price action is leaving typical bear market territory, and suggests sufficient demand is flowing into the market to absorb the profits taken.
This again bares many similarities to the late 2015, 2019, and 2020 eras, which turned out to be market cycle transition points.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
As the Bitcoin market takes a break, profit taking by investors is starting to warm up. Short-Term Holders who accumulated near the cycle lows dominate the majority of spending behavior, although their willingness to hold coins for longer periods is evident.
Overall, the majority of BTC appears to be quite inactive on-chain, suggesting investors continue to have confidence in the prevailing uptrend. Similar to our article last week, through the lens of coin Lifespan, Bitcoin again appears to be entering a transitional market period."

The Stablecoin Shuffle at Binance
Stablecoins have become an integral component of the digital asset space in recent years, acting as a primary rail through which fiat enters, and exits the market. Looking back at the aggregate market cap trend of the major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI), we can see that it has been in decline for 12 months, reaching $125.8B this week, and a total decline of -22% since the all-time high of $161.56B.
Since the collapse of FTX, USDT supply has expanded back to $79.5B, now dominating 63.7% of stablecoin capital. Meanwhile, the second-ranked stablecoin USDC has seen $10B (-23%) in net redemption since breaking the peg during the failure of SVB last month. Similarly, following news of Paxos
halting the issuance of BUSD
in Feb, many investors have redeemed, or converted BUSD into other assets, driving the total BUSD supply down by -52% to $7.7B.
Live Advanced Workbench
Pressure has been mounting on Binance from US regulators in 2023, with the latest news related to the exchange, and its CEO facing a CFTC
lawsuit
due to alleged regulatory violations. Given the degree of uncertainty related to bank and exchange solvency of late, we can assess the net flow of funds in and out of Binance to gauge market sentiment.
The chart below shows the daily net flow of stablecoins flowing through Binance on the Ethereum blockchain. A positive value üü¢ shows aggregate stablecoin supply on Binance has increased (inflows), while the negative value üî¥ underscores a net outflow.
To isolate the net daily flow, a 14-day SMA üîµ is shown which demonstrates a net outflow of -$295M/day, which is the largest net outflow in history.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also assess the total USD denominated asset profile held within of all of Binance's self-reported Proof-of-Reserves addresses. As illustrated, the overall USD value of Binance reserves have declined by $29.6B (-45.1%) but stabilized at $35.9B since FTX-fall out.
The primary drivers of this decline are falls in token prices (affecting non-stablecoin assets), but more recently the sizeable redemptions of BUSD. The YTD market rally has driven the total USD-denomination of Binance reserve back above $35B this week.
Live Standard Chart
We can see the dramatic scale of both growth, and decline of BUSD held within the Binance platform over the 2020-23 cycle. Of note is the historically low balances of USDC ($1.16B) and USDT ($2.17B), in part a function of Binance's attempt to shift trade volume to BUSD pairs in recent months.
Live Advanced Chart
To highlight the scale of Binance held reserves across assets, we can compare it as a proportion to the token circulating supply. Across the major assets BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC, Binance typically custodies between 2.8% to 3.8% of the circulating supply.
However, we can see the scale of BUSD holdings require a separate y-axis, with some 95%+ of circulating supply held at Binance up until FTX collapsed, at which point this metric dropped to 85% to 90%.
Live Advanced Chart
If we look at the coin-denominated balance of BTC and ETH held on Binance, we can see that Bitcoin reserves have increased by 67.93k BTC, and ETH balances are flat YTD. Despite net outflows of stablecoins, the market does not yet appear to be expressing widespread concern about Binance's standing. Despite the developing friction between Binance and regulators, the platform appears to be primarily experiencing a stablecoin shuffle, and remains the largest centralized exchange in the market.
Live Advanced Chart
A Promising Rally
With the spot price of Bitcoin now trading firmly above the Realized Price ($19.78k), the market is trading in what has historically been a macro transitional phase (covered in
WoC 12
, and
WoC 8
). This regime is generally bounded by two pricing models:
The lower bound by the Realized Price üîµ ($19.8k), corresponding to the average on-chain acquisition price for all coins in the supply.
The upper bound by the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio üü† ($33.2k), a variant of the Realized Price that accounts for the relative degree of coin activity on-chain.
Assessing previous market recoveries from protracted bear markets üü¶ into a transitional phase üüß shows many similarities to the current structure. As we covered last week (
WoC 13
), there is relatively little spending taking place by longer-term holders. This causes the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio üü† to climb, suggesting a higher 'HODLer implied value' as a point of potential equilibrium.

The Investor Response Told by Supply
As we close out the first quarter of 2023, BTC prices are up over 68%, putting many investors back into profit. The reaction of Bitcoin holders in response can be observed using the Realized Cap HODL waves, which track the relative distribution of USD wealth stored in various coin age bands. Here, we examine these age bands from a binary point of view:
Supply aged 3-months or less (Hot Money)
Supply aged 3-months or more (HODLer Money)
Reviewing prior market cycles, we see a repeating pattern of wealth rotation from the
Hot Money
towards
HODLer Money
during bear markets (declining Supply < 3-months), and vice versa during euphoric bull markets (as HODLers liquidate at expensive prices).
The share of
Hot Money
is currently near cycle lows, accounting for around 10% to 15% of the stored wealth. This is typical of prior bottom formation periods. The strong market recovery has encouraged a slight wave of wealth to transfer from
HODLer Money
to
Hot Money,
driving their share up by 4.9% as profits are taken.

To further explore this binary supply concept, we have developed a variant of the ¬†RHODL ratio (first introduced in
WoC 6
). This indicator compares the wealth held by single-cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-2y) to the youngest Short-Term Holders (1d-3m). This metric aims to gauge the rotation between the extreme HODLing, and distribution points.
The current structure of the RHODL ratio suggests a notably abrupt rotation of capital starting as FTX collapsed, with coins transferring from long-term holders, towards a new cohort of buyers. This sharp decline in the RHODL Ratio can be seen in prior cycles to be an inflection point, suggesting a changing of the tides.
Distance From The Mean
One of the most popular valuation models for Bitcoin is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. MVRV is best considered as an aggregate unrealized profit multiple held within coin supply.
To construct a tool for evaluating whether the market is close to a 'fair value', we can use a simple statistical framework based on historical values. This provides a form of a compass which shows MVRV Ratio üü† deviations away from its all-time- mean value of 1.8 üîµ.
Depression:
MVRV < Low Band üü¢
Recovery:
Low Band üü¢ < MVRV < Mid-Range üîµ
Excitement:
Mid-Range üîµ < MVRV < High Band üî¥
Euphoria:
High Band üî¥ < MVRV
MVRV is currently trading at 1.4, which aligns more closely with a recovery phase. The all-time-average MVRV of 1.8 implies a price of around $36.1k, which can be seen to be a point of psychological importance, having motivated heavy profit-taking in 2016, 2019-20, and mid-2022.

The Accumulation Trend Score reflects the aggregated balance change of on-chain wallets over the past 30 days, with a higher weight assigned to larger entities (such as whales and institutional-sized wallets). Historically, The early stages of market recoveries tend to trigger a degree of distribution üî¥, returning trend scores below 0.25.
The recent rally toward the 2021-22 cycle baseline (~$30k) has created a similar investor behavior pattern to 2019, returning a trend score above 0.75 for the past two weeks üü¢.

We can further inspect the components of the Accumulation Trend Score to provide a more granular analysis of various wallet balance cohorts. Here we can see that behavior across many wallet cohorts shifted towards balance increase in mid-March, with the only exception being whale entities holding >10k BTC.

In addition to wallet cohorts, the behavior of market participants can be evaluated from the HODLer perspective, measuring supply change based on holding times. The HODLer Net Position Change presents the rolling 30-day change in coins ageing in wallets:
Positive
üü© when coins are ageing and maturing at a greater rate than spending.
Negative
üü• when coin spending rates exceed accumulation and HODLing behavior.
After a brief period of net spending during the FTX crash, maturation once again dominates, reaching above +60k BTC/month, and indicating holder confidence remains steady.
Live Professional Chart
Finally, we can inspect the status of recently accumulated coins via the Illiquid Supply Net Position Change metric. This tool describes the net flow of coins into/from wallets with little to no history of spending, which are generally speaking the opposite of exchanges' hot wallets.
Remarkably this indicator shows that ~36.6k BTC/Month has been adsorbed by this illiquid side of the supply equation. This aligns with our prior observations related to the HODLers, and provides additional evidence to a case of continued confidence in market sentiment, despite the backdrop of regulatory pressure.

Conclusion
The digital asset market is under some of the heaviest regulatory pressure in many years, and yet the conviction and confidence of Bitcoin holders appears unshaken. Quite a remarkable observation given the backdrop.
Whilst Binance has been in the cross-hairs of the CFTC this week, overall, there is little evidence of investors fleeing from the exchange. The primary observation is a structural shift in stablecoins hosted on Binance as BUSD enters redeem-only mode and USDC sees global dominance declining.
This is worth noting, however, as the aggregate stablecoin supply has experienced 22% reduction since the peak 1yr ago. On net, this represents a net capital outflow from the industry, however may also be a force buoying the majors BTC and ETH as investors return to holding the most trustless collateral."

This report discusses the estimated amount of staked ETH that may be withdrawn and sold immediately after the Shanghai upgrade. After examining the different staking cohorts and their motivations for selling their unstaked ETH,
we estimate a total of 170k ETH intended to be sold after the Shanghai upgrade.
We project that only 100k ETH ($190M) of the total accumulated rewards will be withdrawn and sold. Furthermore, we expect to see twice as many validators exiting, but only a limited amount of stake will be released per day. We believe only a fraction of that amount, around 70k ETH ($133M), will actually become liquid.
Even in the extreme case where the maximum amount of rewards and stake are withdrawn and sold, the sell-side volume still falls within the range of the average weekly exchange inflow volume. Therefore, we conclude that even the most extreme case will have an acceptable impact on the price of ETH.
The Shanghai Upgrade
The highly anticipated Shanghai/Capella hard fork is scheduled to take place on 12-April-2023, and will enable the withdrawals of ETH funds staked for Ethereum's new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The earliest deposits were made in November 2020, before the launch of the Beacon chain, and until now, stakers have not been able to access their staked ETH, or the rewards they've accumulated.
Given some stakers have been active since the Genesis of the Beacon Chain, their rewards have accumulated for over two years, alongside a full bull/bear market cycle since then. This has raised much speculation regarding the potential market, and supply impacts as the approximately 18M ETH staked ($33.92B, 15% of ETH's total circulating supply) becomes unlocked. Concerns largely revolve around whether the unlocks may flood the market and temporarily create significant sell-side pressure for ETH.
The objective of this report is to assess the ETH staking landscape, develop a framework to establish staking cohorts, and assess the potential impact of the Shanghai hardfork. To achieve this, we conduct several simulations to answer the following questions:
Who is most likely to withdraw staked ETH?
What is an estimated volume of staked ETH that will be withdrawn?
How much sell-side pressure could we expect from these withdrawals
?

Mapping the Ethereum Staking Landscape
In order to get the full picture of the current staking landscape, we will provide a brief technical overview of the existing actors within Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism:
Depositors
are private individuals, or entities that send 32 ETH to the Ethereum smart contract to activate a validator. A depositor can own as many validators as they are able to stake 32 ETH for.
Validators
are virtual entities that live on the Beacon Chain, servicing Ethereum‚Äôs consensus layer. They can be thought of as a private key and a balance, both recorded on the consensus layer. Validators are pseudorandomly chosen to verify and vouch for the validity of transactions and the information included into a block. Occasionally, they are assigned to propose blocks, in which those transactions are bundled. For their work, validators receive ETH staking rewards, which are split between consensus layer block rewards, and execution layer fee rewards for processing transactions (only the priority fee goes to the validator, whilst the base fee is burned).
Nodes
are the physical hardware which run the validator software. Each node can accommodate many validators. Nodes can be operated by the depositor themselves, or delegated to a third party staking service provider.
Live Advanced Chart
Depositors as the Primary Actor
Significant research has been conducted on Ethereum's staking economy, with much of it focused on validators as the primary actors in the staking economy.
For our analysis, we believe it makes more sense to focus on depositors, as depositors can own multiple validators, and ultimately, it is at the depositor (human) level where decisions about withdrawing funds, and usage of the funds will be made.
In order to understand the possibilities of the Shanghai/Capella update, we will segment the depositors into different cohorts based on the anticipated needs and motivations for staking or unstaking ETH. The following graphic illustrates the segmentations we have chosen, which largely consider four factors:
Depositor Age: The length of time stake has been active.
Depositor Size: The number of validators owned.
Depositor Profitability: The unrealized profit/loss held across owned validators.
Organization: Splitting into Individuals (solo-stakers) or third-party Staking Providers.
Please note: We understand that private individuals or entities may use different depositor wallet addresses to deploy stake to the network. This is often the case with Staking-as-a-Service providers. Therefore, we have separated depositor addresses belonging to these providers from our datasets, and analyzed them separately. This is to prevent any distortion of the signal we are trying to achieve with our analysis below.
Individual vs. Institutional Stakers
When mapping out the staking landscape, it is important to differentiate between private stakers, who have their own technical setups at home, and institutional/staking provider depositors. For the following chart, we exclude staking providers since many of these entities use disposable addresses for their deposits, which would distort the data.
Looking at the number of deposits made per day, and we can segment between one-time depositors üîµ, and wallet addresses that have deposited several times üî¥.
We can see that one-time depositors üîµ who are predominantly active around major events such as the genesis of the Beacon Chain, the Merge, and now in anticipation of the Shanghai upgrade, suggesting a bias towards building confidence in the engineering. Events on the execution layer such the Terra collapse and its cascading consequences did not affect depositing activities.
We also note that the staking pool consists primarily of depositors that have staked multiple times üî¥ (note the log-scale) and thus hold more than one validator. We can see that over 1000 deposits per day have been made by some of these recurring depositors. Interestingly, during the bull run of 2021, the Beacon Chain saw a relative lull in these new deposits.
Staking Providers
Staking providers are larger entities that allow users to delegate their ETH to the provider's validator nodes. By delegating their ETH to these nodes, users can earn rewards for supporting the network without the need to run their own validator node, or to provide the entire 32 ETH.
Liquid staking providers in particular, which return users a tradable token derivative for their stake, have gained massive market share over the course of the past 2 years. Currently, Lido is market leader, holding a market share of over 30% of the entire network stake. Centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance follow with a market share of 11.5%, 7.0%, and 5.4%, respectively.
Live Advanced Chart
Taking a closer look at the number of deposits made by staking providers over time, we can clearly see shifts in dominance:
During the first half year after the genesis of the Beacon Chain
, Kraken and Binance were the dominant depositors. However, they were eventually surpassed by Coinbase and Lido.
Lido dominance expanded massively in the second half of 2021, however the stETH token was put under market stress during the LUNA-UST collapse, as well as the bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital and Celsius. This was due to these entities having sizeable ties or positions in the token at the time.
Consequently, depositing activities by all staking providers, particularly Lido, plummeted in the middle of 2022, and slowly recovered towards the end of the year. Additionally, we observe a massive drawback of staking activities by centralized exchanges, which can be attributed to the increasing pressure by US regulators on these institutions. Kraken eventually ended its US-based staking service in February 2023 after being fined by the SEC, and Coinbase was served a Wells notice in March 2023 regarding its staking service.
Depositor Age
The depositor age takes the deployment date of a validator to calculates the average amount of time a depositor is participating in the staking economy. This includes both one-time and recurring depositors, but again does not includes staking providers.
We then cluster depositors into five bins, reflecting a quarter of the Beacon Chain's lifespan (groups of 7 months), and one for those that pre-date the Beacon Chain launch. To our surprise we detected a relatively high number of 25k depositors, whose average age predates the launch of Ethereum's consensus layer. We attribute these depositors to those investors with very high conviction rate, since deploying validators at that time was highly risky. We even argue that these depositors do not see validating as an investment, but rather as either members of Ethereum's inner circle, or community members highly motivated to secure the network, rather than generate profit.
Furthermore, we can see that the majority of depositors are between six months and one year old. This indicates that there has been a growing confidence and trust in Ethereum's staking economy over the past year, especially after the successful execution of
the Merge
and the near-term prospect of withdrawals being enabled.
Depositor Size
The next step is to examine the size of individual depositors, once again excluding staking providers from our dataset. Unlike the chart above, which counted single deposit events, here we calculate the total number of validators that a depositor's wallet address accumulates over time. We then cluster these into different size bins.
Remarkably, six months after the Beacon Chain launch, the staking pool became split between depositors who held only one validator (shrimp) üîµ, and those who owned more than 500 validators (whales) üü¢. During the last bull run, there were a relatively high number of one-time depositors in the staking pool. However, they decreased sharply during the market turbulence of 2022, as new solo stakers were hesitant to enter the staking pool.
Crab üî¥ and Fish üü° entities with between 2 and 500 validators have a surprisingly small dominance of just 13.5
%
of the total.
Depositor Profitablity
To evaluate a depositor's profitability, we calculate the realized price of their stake, which is the value of ETH at the time of deposit, compared to the current spot price. This provides a gauge on the Unrealized Profit/Loss held on average per depositor.
Currently, the average deposit price
üî¥
across all staked ETH is $2,136, which indicates an average unrealized loss of -13% at current spot prices. In contrast, the realized price for the Ethereum network üîµ, which captures the average price at which the entire ETH supply last moved on-chain, is $1,403, an unrealized profit of +36%.
Upon examining the Realized Price per staking provider, we observe that Coinbase and Lido's average cost base is roughly 50% higher than the current ETH spot price. Binance and Kraken, which saw primary deposit activity at the beginning of the bull run, are at an approximate break-even level between $1,812 and $1,900, respectively.
The high realized price for Coinbase and Lido is an interesting dynamic because both offer a liquid staking derivative for their staked ETH, allowing holders to sell, or better hedge their risk, with depositors potentially securing a better Realized Price in secondary markets.
If the price of the ETH stake at the time of deposit is above today's ETH price, we consider the stake to be at a loss. Not surprisingly, ETH supply that was deposited during the peak bull run between mid-2021 and mid-2022 is held at an unrealized loss. Approximately up to half of the total stake amount is currently held at a loss, which provide some insight into the potential withdrawal dynamics after Shanghai.
Live Workbench Chart
Taking the difference between the ETH Spot Price and the Realized Price for ETH deposits, we deduce the aggregated USD value of unrealized profit or loss held by stakers. Combining this with our depositor size segmentation, we can start to establish groups based on the division of unrealized profits or losses among depositor types. After the peak unrealized loss of $16B in July 2022, the net unrealized loss now amounts to $4.7B. ¬†It is mainly carried by the Whale sized depositors, who hold a 76% share of the unrealized losses.
Simulating Withdrawals after Shanghai
In this section, we estimate the amount of staked ETH that may be withdrawn immediately after the Shanghai upgrade.
Whilst depositors have been unable to withdraw their staked funds, they could still sign a voluntary exit message to signal their wish to exit the staking pool. There are currently 1,229 validators waiting to exit, as well as 214 slashed validators that will be forced out as soon as withdrawals are enabled (for a total of 46,176 ETH, $85.7M).
Live Advaned Chart
Shanghai allows for two types of withdrawals: partial and full. Partial withdrawals, often referred to as skimming, automatically withdraws each validator's cumulative staking rewards, reducing their validator balance to 32 ETH. Full withdrawals involve shutting down the validator entirely and retrieving the entire stake balance.
Validators undergo the same automatic withdrawal processing for partial as well as full withdrawals. An automatic sweep scans linearly through the entire validator set, starting from index 0. If a validator hasn't signed a voluntary exit message or was slashed, the excessive ETH balance is skimmed and automatically sent to the execution layer. If the validator has signed for a voluntary exit and has passed the waiting periods, it is exited. Every slot (12 seconds), 16 validators are scanned and processed. With the current number of validators, this process should take up to 4.5 days.
However, the scanning time to skim through the entire validator set is complicated by the number of validators that have to update their withdrawal credentials. The withdrawal credentials define where the withdrawn ETH is sent to. In the early days of Proof-of-Stake, validators were deployed with 0x00 credentials. These validators need to update their credentials to a 0x01 type in order to participate in the automatic processing. Currently, around 300k validators need to update their withdrawal credentials, which is only possible after the Shanghai/Capella update. For our analysis, we recalculate the duration of the automatic process to be a maximum of 2 days, based on the actual number of validators that are eligible to be skimmed right after the Shanghai update.
Expectations of Partial Withdrawals
Shanghai presents a special case where rewards have accumulated over the course of more than two years, and will be unlocked all at once. Currently, the excess balance, which is not actively participating in Proof-of-Stake, is around 1.137M ETH, around $2.1B in value. After the Shanghai upgrade, this amount will be automatically withdrawn from the Beacon Chain and transferred as an automatic balance update to the depositor's Ethereum mainnet address.
Live Workbench Chart
As described above, only validators with an 0x01 withdrawal credential will participate in the automatic withdrawal process. Currently, around 44% of validators have the right withdrawal credentials. However, there are many validators that still need to update their withdrawal credentials, many of which were deployed during the early days of the Beacon Chain, and have thus accumulated a larger volume of staking rewards. This was analyzed in detail by Data Always, and we have reproduced the chart below to demonstrate how the validator count of these two credential groups has developed.
Datasource:
Data Always
, adjusted for Glassnode. Date as of: 09-04-2023
Based on the ratio determined in the analysis, validators with 0x00 credentials own nearly 75% of the total accumulated rewards. As a result, validators with 0x01 credentials will have access to the remaining 25%, which is equivalent to 276k ETH being withdrawn over the course of two days.
In an extreme case where all remaining validators updated their withdrawal credentials after the Shanghai upgrade, which would occur at a rate of 16 validators per block, we would eventually see the entire sum of 1.137M ETH exit the Beacon Chain over a period of 4.5 days.
The chart below shows the minimum and maximum amount of reward payouts, including the maximum daily amount of ETH being unlocked in each case. The actual numbers will likely fall between these extreme values. We believe that many depositors may wait to unlock their accumulated rewards until after a successful implementation of Shanghai before upgrading their credentials, we therefore take a 50% withdrawal as our benchmark. Therefore, we would expect the actual numbers of unlocked stacking rewards to be closer to the minimum value of
706k ETH ($ 1.31B)
.
To estimate how much of the accumulated rewards will actually be sold, our depositor segmentation above comes in handy. Knowing that Lido holds a significant share in the accumulated rewards and has vowed to mainly re-stake its rewards, we believe other staking providers will follow suit, which would results in a big part of the staking rewards to be locked up again.
We can most likely rule out a high degree of sell-side pressure from the remaining cohorts as well. According to the Depositor Size Dominance Chart, around 75% of non-institutional depositors are large holders, with more than 500 validators or a stake balance of 16,000+ ETH. Depositors of this financial strength are less likely to feel pressure to sell, even if their validators are underwater. Given the positive market trend of the past week, it is more likely that this group of depositors will choose to restake or reinvest their accumulated rewards and wait for the next bull run.
This leaves us with a probable range between 76k ETH ($141M) and up to a likely maximum of 162k ETH ($300M) as a measure of potential sell-side pressure from partial withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade.
Expectations for Full Withdrawals
Looking at full withdrawals, it is important to note that only a limited number of validators can exit per day. Since the security of the Ethereum network depends on a stable set of validators, there are various mechanisms in place to prevent heavy churn of validators, and the rapid draining of stake.
This daily number is defined by the churn rate, which determines both the allowed number of incoming validators and exiting validators. The churn limit itself correlates with the number of active validators in the staking pool.
Churn Limit = ¬†Active_Validators/65536
With the current churn limit of 8 per epoch, and with 225 epochs per day, a limit maximum of 1800 validators can be withdrawn per day, equating to 57.6k ETH. From our historical data, we can see how the churn limit played out with incoming validators.
In addition to the withdrawal period determined by the churn limit, validators have to pass through a withdraw-ability delay. For voluntarily exited validators, this waiting period is 256 epochs, or around 27 hours long. For slashed validators, it is 8192 epochs, or around 36 days. We then again add the duration of the automatic withdrawal process, as described above.
Taking into consideration our data on exited and slashed validators, and accounting for the different waiting periods, we have simulated the accumulated amount of ETH, which is accessible right after the Shanghai upgrade.
After three significant jumps in validators signing for voluntary exits - one right after the Merge in September 2022, and two this year - we currently see an accumulated total of ETH 45,098 (equivalent to $83.3M) that will be made accessible for stakers.
As described above, the stake withdrawal process will take two days for the total amount to have exited the Beacon Chain, which means we will see at least 45,098 ETH ($83.3M) exiting the Beacon Chain between 12-Apr and the 14-Apr.
Live Workbench Chart
Referring back to our depositor segmentation, we can now determine the makeup of depositors who are likely to to initiate a full withdraw of their stake. We see that the already exited validators belong to a total of 253 depositors.
What stands out is that very few staking providers have withdrawn their validators. So far, of the top staking providers only Coinbase has announced that it will allow withdrawals immediately after the Shanghai upgrade. Lido is said to enable withdrawals only in May, and Kraken and Binance have not yet announced dates.
Additionally, we see exiting depositors are predominantly those with only one validator, and those who deployed their stake in the pre-launch phase or first quarter of the Beacon Chain lifespan. This timeframe coincides with the beginning of the bull run, which is why we see a high number of exiting depositors to be holding an unrealized loss.
We generally expect there to be little price pressure from these depositor groups, especially if we attribute a higher conviction to those early stakers. Given the staking landscape has evolved so significantly since genesis, these early solo-stakers are likely to be inclined towards withdrawing, and then redeploying it with a new staking provider setup to reduce the risks and overhead that come along with maintaining a staking setup. They may also wish to benefit from new or Liquid Staking Derivative tokens (LSDs), allowing them to maintain their ETH liquidity, and deploy it as collateral in DeFi, all while still earning Ethereum staking rewards.
Kraken is expected to shut down a significant number of its validators after its US staking service was challenged by the SEC. Another potential large withdrawal could come from Celsius Network, as it will reportedly sell its staked ETH as part of its bankruptcy process, although it is unlikely both institutions will immediately withdraw after the upgrade.
Even in the extreme case of a sudden rise in voluntary exits 27 hours prior to the Shanghai, we would still only see a limited increase in stake that actually becomes liquid due to the churn limit caps. At most, we can expect a maximum of 57,600 ETH ($109.4M) to be unstaked on the day of Shanghai. If the demand to exit remains high, we would see the same amount of ETH being unstaked on a daily basis until the churn limit readjusts.
To put this into context, this amount of withdrawals would result in similar dynamics as we saw in the early days of Proof-of-Work, where miner revenues oscillated around that range (albeit at sub $1 ETH prices).

Estimating the Total Supply Impact
Taking into account both partial and full withdrawals, we can model the potential supply pressure during the first week after the Shanghai upgrade. We have three cases for the expected stake to be unlocked, and prone to be sold by the owner:
Case 1:
In the most extreme case, where the total accumulated rewards as well the permitted maximum amount of stake per week will be withdrawn and sold, we could see a total of 1.54M ETH ($2.93B) becoming liquid.
Case 2:
The current status quo, with only 00x0 credentials receiving staking rewards and 45k ETH to be exited and sold, would see around 312k ETH($592M) becoming liquid over the first week.
Case 3
: Our Best Estimate based on a 50% withdrawal credential update, our segmentation of depositors, and assumptions regarding investor conviction, and profitability. Also believing that the current number of exiting valiators will double around the Shanghai upgrade, we estimate a total of 170k ETH ($323M) to be sold.
To put these numbers into perspective, we can compare this to typical weekly exchange inflow volumes, with example events like FTX collapse to gauge potential scale. Here, we can see that even the most extreme case of 1.53M ETH is still within the range of average weekly exchange inflow. In other words, in the most extreme case the average weekly exchange inflow would double, which would fall into the scale of the recent market correction, with price falling 8.7% but will still be far below the scale of inflows during FTX collapse with price falling 30.2% respectively.
Given the Shanghai upgrade is widely expected and understood, based on this analysis, the unlock event is on a similar scale to day-to-day trade for ETH markets, and is therefore unlikely to be as dire as many speculate it to be.
Live Advanced Chart
Summary and Conclusions
While it is impossible to fully predict the outcomes of the Shanghai upgrade, this analysis sought to address circulating concerns about the economic implications of the supply unlock event.
When looking at staked ETH through the lens of depositors, and segmenting them into different groups, we shed light on the most likely cohorts to generate sell-side pressure. The main bulk of unlocked staking rewards are expected to be from users redeploying towards liquid staking providers, which already have little need to sell due to being underwater.
Currently, there are only 253 depositors waiting to exit their stake, which is a remarkably small number. Most of them are solo-stakers, or stakers from the early days of the Beacon Chain. This leads us to believe that they are the most likely to have a high conviction rate, and withdrawals are most likely related to a change in their technical setup, rather than exiting their position.
Even in the most extreme case of an exodus of validators, Ethereum‚Äôs design of the Proof-of-Stake exit queue will limit the amount of stake that can be drained form the pool at once. Therefore the economic impact of such an even would be stretched out over days to weeks. Based on our analysis, the impact on the Ethereum economy is expected to be a lot less dramatic than many have painted it to be. It is arguably more likely that the technical delivery of the upgrade will bolster a growing staking industry, which seeks to better serve holders of Ether over the long-term."

An interesting development over the last 12 months has been the increased correlation between the performance of BTC prices, relative to Gold, the traditional sound money safe haven. On a 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day basis, the correlation between these two assets is now strongly positive, remaining elevated during the recent US banking crisis a few weeks ago.
This does suggest that an appreciation for both sound money, and the realities of counter-party risk are increasingly front of mind for investors.

If we bring this observation into a distribution chart of investor acquisition prices, we can see three important supply clusters:
Bottom Formation Cluster < $25k:
These coins are those that largely changed hands between June 2022 and Jan 2023. There is an fairly even balance of LTH (pre-FTX) and STH (post-FTX) buyers in this range.
Recent Acquisition $25k to $30k:
These coins amount to 7.25% of the supply, and are much more heavily weighted towards STH coins. This reflects a combination of profit taking from below, and coins sold to break-out buyers as price rallied above $25k.
Cycle Survivors $30k+:
The remaining Long-Term Holders who weathered the volatility and chaos of the 2021-22 cycle, and are still holding, amounting to 22.2% of the supply.

We can also view the current market cycle from the lens of Long-Term Holder behavior, expressed via changes in their held Supply. We can see three key phases:
Plateau of Patience
, where LTH supply tends to hover around its ATH, often from several months, to over a year.
Peak HODL
, where LTH supply in profit (dark blue) rises rapidly, and is usually associated with a run-up in prices towards the ATH.
Distribution upon Breaking ATH
, where LTHs start to distribute heavily into waves of new demand that are entering the market.
The market currently sits well within the Plateau of Patience, with over 23.3% of the supply held outside exchanges owned by LTHs who are underwater on their position. The current supply structure also has many similarities to early 2016 and early 2019.

As price rallies out of the bottom formation zone, all of these coins return to profit. In 2023, a total of 6.2M BTC have returned to profit (32.3% of supply), giving an indication of just how large this cost basis foundation is below $30k.
Live Advanced Chart
With so many coins returning to an unrealized profit, it follows that the incentive to spend and sell will start to rise. The popular NUPL metric provides a measure of how much of the Bitcoin market cap is held as an unrealized profit.
At the current reading of 0.36, the market is at a very neutral level, with 55.8% of days recording a higher reading, and thus 44.2% being lower. This is coincident with past cycles where a transition between a bear and bull markets have taken place. It also suggests that the market is neither heavily discounted (like it was at $16k), nor heavily overvalued (like at the $60k+ peak).

HODLer Holdings
Despite the Bitcoin price climbing over 100% since the lows, there is yet to be any significant uptick in older coins being spent. The chart below shows that coins younger than 3-months still represent less than 20% of the wealth held in Bitcoin, which is usually associated with bear cycle lows.
By contrast, this means coins older than 3-months (HODLers) hold over 80% of the wealth, despite the brutal drawdown of 2022, and market upswing in 2023.
Live Advanced Chart
Both of the above two observations can be visualized within the RHODL ratio, which is in the process of reversing from a point of peak HODLer saturation. By this metric, the cycle has most likely turned in the favour of the bulls, however is is also no longer in undervalued territory (nor overvalued by historical standards).
65.8% of all trading days have recorded higher RHODL Ratio, providing further evidence that HODLers remain the dominant entity within the market, and supply holdings.

A Healthy Recovery
Whilst HODLers are often associated with coin dormancy, the Bitcoin network remains very much alive with activity. Organic transaction counts are now over 270k/day, which is approaching cycle, highs on a monthly average basis.
This is associated with both monetary transfers, but also with the emergence of Inscriptions, which have surpassed 1 million total milestone this week.

Summary and Conclusions
Whilst Bitcoin and digital assets experience a relatively high degree of market volatility, many on-chain indicators, which reflect collective human decisions, are surprisingly consistent.
Exactly 64-weeks ago, we covered how several on-chain indicators were likely entering bear market territory (
WoC 4-2022: Sizing Up a Bitcoin Bear
). Readers may also find our review of the
May 2021 Sell-off
informative, as this can be argued to be the 'psychological start' of the bear.
In this piece, we cover how several on-chain indicators are suggesting that bear market conditions (or at least the worst of it) may now be behind us. Bitcoin sits in somewhat neutral territory, and above the foundation forming supply cluster between $16k to $25k, where significant coin volume changed hands. We note that much of this supply remains tightly held by those buyers, whilst profits are being taken (
WoC 12
), and network utilization is improving, all supporting the strong market performance YTD."

The Bitcoin market found resistance this week, reverting from the weekly high above $30,456k, back down to a low of $27,169k. The opening to 2023 has been historically strong from a price performance perspective, with remarkably few significant corrections along the way, with the largest being -18.6%.
If we allow ourselves the assumption that the November low is indeed a longer-term low, we can see that the scale of drawdowns during this upswing so far, are small relative to past cycles.
With this as context, in this edition, we will focus on both the supply foundation formed over recent months, and then follow up with the profit taking behavior seen this week. We will consult several SOPR variants which offer a lens into the typical behavior patterns seen during corrections in a upswing, as compared to more structural bearish trends.

A Supply Foundation Below
With the strong opening to 2023, the aggregate market has confidently transitioned out of a regime of unrealized loss, towards one of unrealized profit, shown by the sharp divergence between supply held in profit vs loss. As this takes place, the incentive to take profits grows.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also see this by taking the ratio between Supply in Profit and Supply in Loss. This oscillator has achieved escape velocity this year, confirming the transition out of a regime of loss dominance near cycle lows, observed on only 415-of-4638 trading days (9%).
Live Advanced Workbench
Mechanically, these large rebounds in unrealized profit occurs as price rallies above the dense concentration of supply which was accumulated during the bottoming formation process. We can quantify this mechanic by inspecting the 100 day change in profitable supply coming off major cycle lows in both BTC, and Percent of Circulating terms:
2011 Cycle Low:
+1.99M BTC (19.8%)
2015 Cycle Low:
+4.94M BTC (32.2%)
2019 Cycle Low:
+6.86M BTC (38.4%)
2022 Cycle Low:
+4.87M BTC (25.5%)
The current cycle has seen a comparable volume of the supply re-enter a profitable position, suggesting an equally robust floor.

Exploring Profit Taking Behavior
The Bitcoin spot price is currently trading between two popular On-chain pricing models; the Realized Price at $19.9k representing the average acquisition price of the supply, and the Realized-to-Liveliness Ratio at $33.0k.
This second model is akin to a HODLer Implied Fair Value üü†, and will trade higher when more of the coin supply is dormant in investor wallets. Spot markets fell short of reaching this level this week, topping out around $30.5k.
This suggests that the market has transitioned out of the ‚Äòdeep-value‚Äô zone as signaled by trading below the Realized Price, and has reverted back towards a holder implied ‚Äòfair value‚Äô level. With this, we can also expect an increase in the probability of profit taking behavior from coins acquired at cheaper prices.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can evaluate changes in the accumulation and distribution behavior of various cohorts over the last six months using the chart below:
Phase 1: Heavy accumulation post-FTX
across all cohorts, effectively starting the cycle low formation.
Phase 2: Distribution during the Jan-Feb impulse higher
as the first significant rally after the brutal bear of 2022 rolled around.
Phase 3: Light accumulation on the rally back to $28k
as market momentum increased, and prices finally broke above $30k.
Over recent weeks, we can see a mix of behavior, suggesting indecision across all cohorts bar the largest of entities with 10k+ BTC. This aligns with aggregate consolidation, the brief break above $30k, and the subsequent sell-off back to $27k this week.
Live in Professional Engine Room
Following on, the SOPR metric can also be used track the magnitude of profit and loss taking events across the wider market. Here, we define a framework consisting of two binary regimes, which we shall utilize to define market behavior patterns:
üü•
Loss Dominant Regime:
Successive prints below 1.0 indicate investors are locking in losses, whilst any returns to breakeven profitability is often utilized as exit point (forming resistance).
üü©
Profit Dominant Regime:
Successive SOPR prints above 1.0 indicates a return of profit taking. This is often accompanied by SOPR returning to breakeven being considered a near term value point.
A clear shift between these two regimes was noted in January, as market behavior started to exhibit patterns aligned with a profit dominated regime. With aSOPR currently retesting the break-even level of 1.0, this puts the market close to a decision point.
Live Advanced Chart
We can see a similar structure within the Short-Term Holder SOPR variant, as newly acquired coins have returned to an unrealized profit. The correction in March traded below the psychological $20k level, before experiencing a powerful reversion higher.
This is SOPR pattern is typically observed during constructive pullbacks, and provides a guide for interpreting moving forwards. A sustained period below 1.0 however, could signify a more onerous scenario, where underwater holders start to panic, adding further sell-side.
üéì
SOPR Guide
: We have a detailed metric guide for SOPR, and different variants available within

Live Professional Chart
Long-Term Holder SOPR variant tends to better reflect macro market shifts. Following an extended period of realized losses (LTH-SOPR < 1.0), the LTH cohort are finally transitioning back into a regime of profitable spending, a structure similar once again to past cycle transition points.
This thesis was further explored last week (
WoC 16
), where the LTH cohort at the moment consist of many 2021-22 cycle holders, many of whom remain underwater, and are likely to create resistance throughout the market recovery.

A Return of Capital Inflows
In this final section, we shall inspect the changes in USD denominated profit and loss events, to put the above observations into context, relative to total market size.
The chart below shows, the magnitude of USD denominated profit taken this year, remains well below 2021 cycle highs. It is however of a similar scale to that observed in 2019. It is important to note that market prices rallied from $4k to $14k in 2019, which has a peak 50% lower than our current price of just below $28k.
Live Advanced Workbench
This sentiment is also echoed across the realized loss domain, which continues to decline. Total losses remain quite low relative to all major sell-off events throughout 2021-22. This does suggest that a degree of sell-exhaustion has been reached at a macro scale, at least from the lens of wide-scale holders locking in significant losses (i.e. cycle top buyers).
Live Professional Chart
Finally, we can evaluate the cumulative sum of all realized profit and loss events, more commonly referred to as the Realized Cap. After experiencing significant growth during both legs of the bull market in 2020-21, the Bitcoin network experienced a significant net capital outflow in 2022, contracting back to July 2021 levels.
The Realized Cap has finally stabilized in 2023, and is beginning to see growth, and positive capital inflows once more.
Live Professional Chart
Summary and Conclusions
After a remarkably strong start to 2023, the BTC market has run up against its first appreciable resistance, reverting the rally up to $30k. This comes alongside a very large cross section of the market seeing their holdings recover above acquisition price, creating a more favorable, and profitable environment.
The aggregate value of profits realized remain relatively small compared to the size of the asset, however, they are of a USD magnitude equivalent to the 2019 rally to $14k. With accumulation and distribution behavior across several wallet cohorts mixed at the moment, the market appears less decisive than it has been in the first quarter of the year."

Ancient Coins Revive
By examining the volume of spent supply from 7y-10y and +10y age bands, we observe that approximately 3.2k BTC were revived this week, with 1.1k BTC originally acquired in the pre-2013 era.
After filtering out internal transfers via entity-adjustment üü•, we can confirm that these transfers were not internal. However, the magnitude of these incidents were not relatively significant compared to previous isolated events during cycle pivot points.

Taking a birdseye view of Ancient Supply spending, we can see that since the inception of Bitcoin, only 4.25M coins have reached the status of Ancient Supply (7+ Years). Remarkably, only 356K of these ancient coins have ever been spent, equivalent to 8.3% of the all-time total. The remaining 3.9M (20% of circulating supply) remains dormant, often assumed to be lost.
Live Advanced Workbench
If we look at the rumours about Mt Gox coins being on the move, we can see that their balance has remained stable at 137,890 BTC since the first tranche of distributions in 2018, and no coins were released from this wallet. Whilst no spending was observed lately, it is expected that distributions will commence in 2023, making this balance, currently worth $3.93B, one to keep track of.

Alert Idea:
tracking the Mt Gox Balance falling below the current level of 137,890 BTC would give an immediate alert as soon as a spend takes place, likely signalling the start of distributions.

Probing The Demand
In previous editions (
WoC 12
,
WoC 14
), we demonstrated how the proportion of wealth held within the
Young Supply
age bands (< 6-months) can offer a view into the demand side of the market.
The charts below show the proportion of both BTC, and USD-denominated wealth held by these recent buyers. The rising share of younger supply during a rally is an indication of capital flowing into the market. This also signals that
Old Supply
(> 6-months) is spending, often taking advantage of this demand liquidity, leading to a net transfer of cheap/old coins to new buyers at higher prices.
The monthly Net Position Change of young supply shows that this net sell pressure has reached and stabilized at a rate of +250k BTC per month. This wave of demand increased the total young supply by 366K BTC.
Compared to significant rallies in the prior cycle, this pattern appears similar to the 2019 uptrend, which was followed by a period of equilibrium prior to the 2020-21 bull.
Live Advanced Workbench
A similar pattern can be observed in the transfer of USD-denominated wealth into the
Young Supply
region. The share of wealth held by new investors has increased from 20%, to 40% of the total, a similar uplift to that seen in early-2019.
This puts 28.2% of the total invested wealth in the hands of recent buyers, which remains remarkably low, and is still not over the threshold level of +40% seen in prior bull markets. This suggests that new demand inflows remain relatively soft, but the supply remains predominantly held by longer-term, higher conviction holders.
Live Advanced Chart
Riding The Wave
After illustrating the intrinsic relation between inflows of demand, and wealth held by
Young Supply
, we can derive indicators which study the behavior of these
new investors,
who are a key driving force of an up-trending market.
The chart below displays the average cost basis of these Young/Old Supply cohorts alongside the market average.
Old Supply Cost Basis (> 6m)
üîµ
Market Supply Cost Basis (average)
üü†
Young Supply Cost Basis (< 6m)
üî¥
The first note is that the market has firmly recovered from the historical bottom discovery phase of the 2022 bear üü™. More recently, the rapid spot price appreciation has driven the cost basis of new investors ($25.1k) üî¥ above all other cohorts, as in-flowing demand chases the rally.
This is the first time since Nov 2022 that the cost basis of old supply ($24.1k) is back in a superior position to new buyers (many of whom were active immediately after FTX failed).
Live Advanced Workbench
The next step is to seek indicators for whether the market is approaching any overheated conditions. The next chart shows the weekly
Rate of Change
for the aforementioned cost basis, which we can use this metric to gauge the intensity of wealth acquisition by each cohort.
Overheated conditions in the past often aligned with both young supply üî¥, and the overall market üü† surpassing a weekly change of 4%-8%, with past instances seeing an extended correction afterwards.
The recent market surge has not yet breached the 4%/wk threshold, however, the young supply has come close at 3.4%. This observation means that the market has not yet experienced the same magnitude of rapid appreciation as was seen in Dec 2017, Jun 2019, and Jan 2021.
Live Advanced Workbench
Has Bitcoin Overheated?
So far, we have highlighted the significance of Short-Term Investor behavior during the rally out of the cycle lows. Next, we will focus on metrics which enable us to evaluate whether the rally reached a degree of ‚Äòoverheated‚Äô thus far.
First, we zoom into the average unrealized profit held by Short-Term Holders via the MVRV metric, which is the ratio between the spot price, and their on-chain cost-basis. The weekly average of this indicator, helps to identify the possibility of short-term corrections, typically seen when STH-MVRV is above 1.2, signalling a 20% unrealized profit. Macro tops tend to see even higher values, often above 1.4.
Recent resistance was found at the $30k level, corresponding with STH-MVRV hitting 1.33, and putting new investors at an average 33% profit. Should a deeper market correction develop, a price of $24.4K level would bring a STH-MVRV back to a break-even value of 1.0, which has shown to be a point of support in up-trending markets.
Live Professional Workbench
A more sensitive-to-price indicator, tracking similar behavior, is the ratio of
Short-Term Holder Unrealized Profit vs Loss.
Studying prior uptrends, we can identify three distinct areas of interest for this ratio:
STH-Supply Profit > 95% (P/L Ratio > 20)
: Underlines an extremely profitable position of new investors.
STH-Supply Profit > 80% (P/L Ratio > 4):
Frequently revisited during corrections within macro uptrends, and can signal point of near-term seller exhaustion.
STH-Supply Profit > 50% (P/L Ratio > 1):
Representing a balanced profit vs loss position for new investors. Falling below this level tends to precede a more extensive price contraction, however, there are examples of the market finding support at this level during strong bull runs.
Within the 2023 rally, we can already find several instances reaching, and reacting to all three zones, with the sell-off in early March being a perfect showcase of a reaction at zone 3.
Again, if we consider the potential of a deeper correction in near future, zone 3 would be reached at the cost basis of new investors, located at approximately $24.4K.
Live Advanced Workbench
Realized Profit to Exchanges
Exchanges are a common destination for speculator funds and the primary venue for price discovery. We can assess the capital flowing into/out of exchanges as a measure of the investor response.
The recent rally was no exception, with exchanges seeing non-trivial inflows of late, pushing the
Net Position Change
above +30k BTC/Month in recent weeks. This metric has fallen slightly to 22.3k BTC/Month, which translates to a smaller, but persistent sell pressure in the market.
Live Advanced Chart
Among both Long-Term üü¶ and Short-Term üü• Holder cohorts sending coins to exchanges, the dominance of the Short-Term Holders remains a consistent 90%-95% of total inflows. Of note is the increase of profit taking by STHs in 2023, denoted by the deeper dark red zone, which accounts for 58% of exchange inflows at present.
Live Professional Chart
Isolating the share of Short-Term Holders Profit from the total exchange inflows, we see that since early Jan, there have been two waves of profit taking by this cohort, peaking at 60% of the total. Within the current market, the second wave of short-term holders profit realization aligns with the recent correction.
Live Professional Chart
Conclusion
In this edition, we addressed the rumors concerning the movement of Ancient Supply, Mt. Gox Trustee funds, and supply controlled by the US Government. Given the significant size of these balances, setting Alerts is an excellent tool for providing automatic notification should their balance decline.
We also revisited the concept of Old/Young wealth redistribution through up-cycles, and utilized it to gauge demand in the market. Via an assessment of the various cohort cost basis, we illustrated how new investors influence the market, largely driven by their unrealized and realized profit performance.
From this, we observed that sell pressure by new investors was a key driving force that established resistance at $30k. Should this present correction resume, the cost basis of the young supply holders at $24.4k may well be a psychological level to monitor in the weeks ahead."
2023,19,2023-W19,2023-05-08,2023-05-14,Bearish,27695.06,26929.98,27211.60,-2.76,Agree,"On 12th April 2023, the Ethereum network underwent a major upgrade with the Shanghai/Capella hardfork, which enabled the withdrawal of ETH funds staked for the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. After more than two years, stakers are finally able to receive accumulated rewards, exit their staked positions, or initiate changes to their staking setup.
Contrary to popular belief, the Ethereum market did not appear shaken by these fund becoming liquid after the upgrade. Instead, prices climbed to $2,110 in the week afterwards, before reverting back to $1,920, likely driven by the general decline across the digital asset market.
In this week's edition, we will follow up on our
pre-Shanghai report
where we attempted to gauge the degree of true sell-side pressure expected, which we estimated to be around 170k ETH. In this report, we will assess what has actually happened since the upgrade, with a focus on the balance of withdrawals, deposits, and the entities initiating them.

Bitcoin Weekly Video Report
The emergence of Ordinal Theory and Inscriptions have given rise to a whole host of new demand cases for Bitcoin blockspace. This week, we have seen fee pressure climb to incredible levels, driving miner revenue up almost 2x in just a few short days.
Reassessing Our Predictions
In
our last report
, we came up with three possible scenarios of what may happen post-Shanghai, based on our assessment of the technical characteristics of Proof-of-Stake, as well as the history of development in the staking industry.
The final amount of unstaked ETH is not only determined by the demand for exits, but furthermore by two technical mechanisms, the withdrawal types, and the Churn Limit. In this report, we will briefly recap how both work, for a more detailed explanation please consult the previous
(WoC 15)
.
We estimated both how much stake would be withdrawn (789.5k ETH) during the week following the Shanghai/Capella update, and the volume likely to be sold (170k ETH). Our total withdrawal estimate turned out to be too conservative, as we did not expect the exchange Kraken to exit 125,088 ETH within the first week, amidst pressure from the SEC to close down its US-based staking service.
The actual numbers are between our estimate and the maximum possible amount. During the first week, 856k ETH rewards and a total of 232k ETH have been unstaked. Partial withdrawals accounted for 80% of the total amount of released ETH.
When examining how much of this withdrawn stake that was actually sold, we can consult the average weekly exchange inflows over the same period. We can see that there was no appreciabe increase in inflow volume, with up to 1.8M ETH of exchange inflows in the first seven days after the upgrade. These numbers are much smaller compared to other major 'sell-side' events in the past, and very much in line with typical inflow patterns.
Based on this, we can confidently say that our expectations were accurate, in that the Shanghai sell-side pressure did not lead to an appreciable increase in day-to-day trade volumes.
Live Advanced Chart
Exited Stake to Exceed Rewards
The upgrade introduced two types of withdrawals: partial and full withdrawals. In partial withdrawals, the rewards of each validator are automatically withdrawn and transferred to the owner's account on the Ethereum mainnet every 4.5 days. Full withdrawals occur when a staker decides to shut down their validator(s) and retrieve their staked ETH capital.
To initiate a full withdrawal, the staker must manually sign an exit message, enter an exit queue, and wait for around 1 day before the unstaked ETH is withdrawn via the same automatic skimming process that takes up to 4.5 days. In addition to voluntary exits, there are also forced exits called slashing.
To receive rewards from the staking pool, around 300k of the stakers were required to update their withdrawal credentials. In the first week, 85% of the missing credentials were updated, with more than 200k credential updates during the first two days. Currently, we are closer to the maximum amount, with 98% of credentials updated.
As a result, the withdrawal process for both partial and full withdrawals is now taking closer to 4.5 days, which was the intended timeframe according to the protocol design. For a more detailed explanation on this, please refer to our previous
report.
At first, the unstaked ETH consisted to a large degree of partial withdrawals, as all accumulated rewards were released all at once. To date, 84% of the accumulated staking rewards have been withdrawn, with the remaining 16% attributed to missing credential updates.
The number of full withdrawals is determined by the number of validators exiting, which is then constrained by the Churn Limit. This limit currently sits at 1800 validators (57,600 ETH), and is applicable to both entering, and exiting validators.
After the upgrade, the demand for exits immediately maxed out, with stake being withdrawn capped at 57,600 ETH. Since 28th April, the cumulative sum of exited stake has exceeded that of withdrawn rewards. This is an interesting development, as many analyses focused mainly on rewards as the main source of ETH sell-side pressure, however full withdrawals have overtaken partial in terms of unstaked volume.
Refinding Equilibrium
The estimated annual percentage rate (APR) for validators is negatively correlated with the number of active validators. With 561k validators currently in the staking pool, the estimated APR is 4.27%.
The staking protocol limits the maximum effective balance to 32 ETH, meaning that any rewards added to a validator's balance and could not be redeployed until the upgrade. The average balance per validator before the upgrade had risen to 34 ETH as a result, with 2 ETH left effectively inactive.
Following the upgrade and the first round of automatic reward withdrawals, the average balance has now declined to 32.39 ETH, where we expect it to remain around from now on, as rewards are automatically transferred back to the staker.
Live Workbench Chart
Regularly skimming and transferring rewards back to the Ethereum mainnet will act to increase the effectiveness of stake. The ineffective balance has reduced from 1.12M ETH Pre-Shanghai to 223k ETH today, and as a result, we now see that 98.1% of the stake is efficiently used to secure the network.
Live Advance Chart
The Path of Exited Stake
As of today, a total of 48,341 validators have exited, amounting to 1.55M ETH ($2.93B). Unsurprisingly, the day after the Shanghai/Capella upgrade 14,249 validators exiting, which remains the largest daily count. After this peak, exit events quickly tapered off, having levelled off to between 300 and 700 per day.
There was also an incident where 11 validators were slashed shortly after the update, which was attributed to human error by one of the node operators of the liquid staking provider, Lido.
Live Chart
On the other side of the equation, we see over 23k validators are waiting in the entry activation queue, while the exit queue has shrunk down to just 1,837. Observing the two different queues, we see that exit events are offset by new deposits, resulting in zero net change in the active validator count.
However, given the tapering off of exits, and persistently high inflow of new staking entrants, we expect a net increase to validator counts in the near future. This high number of new deposits into the staking pool also provides another explanation for the absence of appreciable sell pressure.
Upon analyzing the composition of exited stake, and excluding slashed exits, we can conclude that the majority of exits came from centralized exchanges that offer staking services.
Kraken alone has withdrawn 15,501 validators, representing 496k out of the 1.55M in total exited ETH (32%). Binance follows with 6,000 deactivated validators, Coinbase with 5,179, Figment with 2,514, and Gate.io with 1,000 validators. The remaining exchanges had fewer than 1,000 exits. It should be noted that Lido has not yet enabled withdrawals.
Out of the 48,341 voluntary exits, just 2,561 (6.6%) were initiated by stakers that are not associated with centralized staking service providers.
Surprisingly, a large number of deposits (15,522 validators) were made by individual stakers. This supports our previous findings that this group tends to become more active around major events. We also observe a continuous stream of deposits from Lido suggesting sustained demand for liquid staking derivative tokens.
(Note that withdrawals depicted in the chart below are time-shifted, based on our estimate of when the funds were received by mainnet wallets based on the duration of the exit queue, withdrawal period, and skimming process.)
Despite the increased activity around newly exiting and deposited validators, the aggregate composition of the Staking Pool has remained almost unchanged. Kraken, the staking provider that saw the most exited validators, reduced its total stake by only 1.1%, while Binance reduced its stake by around 0.5%. Rocket Pool was the biggest gainer, with 2.3%, and stakefish gained 1.7%.
Liquid staking provider Lido still holds the largest market share, with 33.5% dominance, followed by the staking services of the centralized exchanges Coinbase with 11% and Kraken with 7.1%.
Summary and Conclusion
Since the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, a significant amount of stake has been withdrawn. Besides the one-time event of the accumulated rewards to be withdrawn at once, we saw over 48,000 validators leaving the Ethereum Staking Pool, resulting in 1.55 million ETH being withdrawn.
Despite the ability for stakers to withdraw their accumulated rewards and exit their staked positions from the staking pool, this does not ¬†seem to ¬†have had significant impact on market prices. This may be attributed, among other factors, to the high demand for deposits seen during this period, offsetting unstaked and distributed ETH. This trend is expected to continue in the near future, resulting in a net positive flow into the staking pool.
Despite increased activity around both exiting, and depositing validators, this has not significantly altered the aggregate distribution of stake dominance among staking providers.
Overall, the results of the analysis suggest that the mechanics of Proof-of-Stake for both incoming and exiting validators have played out as intended, with Ethereum's consensus mechanism remaining stable throughout the process. This is likely to de-risk longstanding engineering challenges, with net positive effects for both the security of the network, and the economy built upon it.

Transaction counts for Bitcoin reached new all-time-highs, and the average fee paid per block to miners surpassed the block subsidy of 6.25 BTC. Whilst it remains to be seen whether these BRC-20 tokens gain long-term traction, the brief bump in mining revenue was surely a welcome reprieve for miners after the savage bear market of 2022.
In this edition, we will explore the impact that demand for BRC-20 tokens have had for Bitcoin on-chain activity, inscription types, and miner revenues.

A New Demand For Bitcoin Blockspace?
This week, the Bitcoin network experienced a historically large inflow of demand for blockspace with the emergence of BRC-20 tokens. The shorthand summary of BRC-20 is that it is a proposed mechanism for issuing tokens on the Bitcoin ledger. The system leverages ordinal theory (
see our report
), and is enacted by inscribing JSON text files into the blockchain.
Given the small data footprint of text inscriptions, and large the fees BRC-20 users were willing to pay, miners were able to fill blocks with a record number of transactions. A new ATH daily transaction count of 682k was reached this week, eclipsing the 2017 peak by an incredible 39%.
Live Advanced Chart
The average number of transactions per block more than doubled, increasing from the typical baseline of around 2k transactions per block, to over 4.3k per block. Since Bitcoin has a blocksize limit, such a significant increase in transaction counts is a direct result of inscriptions utilizing the 75% discount applied to witness data, thus allowing a denser consumption of available block capacity.
Live Advanced Chart
Interestingly, whilst transaction activity was booming, the number of active addresses fell to cycle lows of 566k addresses per day. This is a curious scenario, whereby many BRC-20 users appear to have re-used their Bitcoin addresses, perhaps due to having more familiarity with the way account based chains like Ethereum or Solana operate, and less so with the Bitcoin UTXO system.
Live Advanced Chart
Tsypruyan first identified this behavior, noting that 71% of transaction outputs were re-using addresses, an uptick from the ~50% baseline (which is largely associated with exchange wallet management).
Currently around 71% of

tx outputs are sent to previously used addresses.

Text Takes Over
Since BRC-20 inscriptions are just small JSON text files, and take advantage of the 75% SegWit discount on witness data, their on-chain data footprint is relatively small. As a result, the average transaction size (in bytes) collapsed to 405 bytes, which is almost an all-time-low.
This is a full reversal from the first wave of primarily image based inscriptions seen in Q1, which reached new all-time-highs of ~1.5 kilobytes per transaction.
Live Advanced Chart
The explosion of text based inscriptions has left the first wave of images and files in the dust. In several instances throughout May, more than 350k text inscriptions were encoded to the chain in a single day, sustaining levels well above 250k/day over the last week.
Live Professional Dashboard
Out of the pool of total confirmed transactions, text based inscriptions accounted for over 50% of them. This is significantly higher than the 5% to 20% dominance seen with image inscriptions in the first wave, demonstrating the scale of this wave of demand.
Live Professional Dashboard
As a result, the total number of text inscriptions to date has firmly eclipsed those of images, surpassing by 5-million in number. There is now almost a full order of magnitude more text based vs image based inscriptions, having reached a total of 5.69-million text files written to the Bitcoin blockchain (accounting for 89% of the total so far).
Note, the y-axis of the chart below is in log-scale.

Miners Are Paid a Brief Bonus
The extreme urgency of BRC-20 transactors is captured the the extraordinary fees they paid for the experience. As congestion in our Bitcoin mempool reached fever pitch, fee pressure rose dramatically.
For only the fifth time in history, the average fee paid per block surpassed the block subsidy, with the last instance being at the 2017 market peak. For all five of these events, the period of high fee pressure was short-lived, and subsided after just a few days.
At the height of the BRC-20 mania, the average mined block was paying 6.66 BTC in fees, making for a total reward of 12.9 BTC per block (~$348k).
Live Professional Chart
Text files during this second wave accounted for between 30% and 60% of total fees paid, which is significantly higher than the 5% to 20% typically seen during the first wave if image inscriptions.
Live Professional Dashboard
In total, inscriptions have paid a cumulative sum of 1,262 BTC in fees to miners, with 1,090 BTC (86%) of this occurring during the last week. The chart below shows just how explosive the fee pressure associated with text files has been.
Live Professional Dashboard
With this rapid rise in demand for Bitcoin blockspace, the total USD denominated fees paid per day almost set a new all-time-high, peaking at $17.8M/day. A challenging side effect of this was that the cost of sending a regular Bitcoin transaction also reached extreme heights, with the median and mean fee required to get a transaction included in a block hitting $20.17 and $30.80, respectively.
Live Advanced Chart
Over the last month the spot price of BTC has traded between $26k and $30k. Over this same period, miners have earned $773M in revenue from the 6.25 BTC block subsidy. With this recent bump in fee pressure, miners have earned an additional $100M in aggregate revenue.
As a result, the proportion of miner revenue associated with fees reached 11.5%, which is coincident with the elevated levels seen in both the 2017, and 2021 bull market periods.
Live Advanced Chart
The acceleration of fee pressure is also historically significant. The chart below presents a series of Z-Scores for miner fee revenue, with training windows ranging from 1-year, to 4-years. The aim is to identify periods where fee pressure has risen in a statistically significant way across a wide range of market conditions.
On the shorter 1y-2y windows, the acceleration of fee pressure is arguably the fastest in history, comparable only to the 2011 era when Bitcoin barely had a year of price history. On the longer-term 3y-4y windows, fee pressure rose faster and larger than the 2021 bull market, and is best compared to the 2013 and 2017 bull markets.
Live Advanced Chart
The USD revenue earner per Exahash, often called the hash-price, is the ideal tool for assessing the impact to miner revenues. It accounts not only for the BTC spot price, and fee pressure, but also for the estimated hashrate that is competing to earn the reward.
Hash-price briefly ticked up to $172.2k/EH this week, however has since collapsed by 55%, back to $76.3k/EH as fee pressure subsided. Whilst this burst of blockspace demand provided a positive uptick in miner revenues, it is short-lived thus far, and pales in comparison to the relentless downtrend (in log-scale) of hash-price.
Live Advanced Chart
Out of the 3,275 BTC in total fees paid to miners over the last 2-weeks, the aggregate miner balance has only increased by 655 BTC, approximately 20% of the fees paid. The blue trace below shows the proportion of newly mined BTC that miners are spending, and it continues to oscillate around 100%.
Overall, whilst miners no doubt enjoyed the revenue uptick, it appears the majority of it was distributed, likely providing relief after the brutal downtrend that was the 2022 bear market.
Live Professional Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The emergence of Ordinals, Inscriptions, and now BRC-20 tokens continues to be one of the more unexpected developments in Bitcoin, sparking healthy debate about the technical, practical, and philosophical merits. What is known, is that so far, these technologies have given rise to a new buyer for Bitcoin blockspace, both at the lower, and now upper bounds of fee rates paid.
This week saw aggregate fees paid surpass the block reward for only the fifth time in history. The event pushed USD denominated fee revenue almost to new ATHs of $17.8M/day, and provided miners with a sorely needed revenue boost after 2022.
It remains to be seen whether Inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens have staying power long-term, however it does give us a new lens through which to observe demand for the settlement assurances of Bitcoin."

In fact, this has been one of the tightest trading ranges over the last few years, with the last examples being the 2023 yearly open, and July 2020 after the recovery from the COVID sell-off.
This comes alongside extremely light on-chain volume, with aggregate, entity-adjusted, and exchange related flows remaining at cyclical lows. Meanwhile, large swathes of the coin supply remain dormant in investor wallets, with several key age bands hitting all-time-highs.
In this edition, we will explore this interesting state of play, and what it tells us about investor confidence, incentives, and perspective on the 2023 market.

Volume Down
In
last weeks edition
, we shows how on-chain activity for Bitcoin has reached historical highs for metrics such as Transaction counts, largely related to ordinals, inscriptions, and BRC-20 tokens. These types of transactions tend to represent relatively small BTC volumes however, with ordinals often transferred alongside a small volume of BTC (usually around 10k sats = 0.0001 BTC).
Assessing the Transfer Volume settled by the Bitcoin network across the last three years, we note a large decline in overall economical throughput since early 2021, falling from a cycle high of $13.1B to a cycle low of $1.9B, a 85.5% decline. Transfer volumes have experienced a marginal uplift in 2023, however remain near cycle lows between $1.9B and $4.4B.
Live Professional Chart
Exchanges remain a centerpiece for BTC trade, and studying the flows in and out provides a robust proxy for trade volume, awareness, speculation demand, and investor confidence. We see a similar structural decline in exchange deposit volume, declining from a peak of $4.2B in May 2021 to a low of $343.4M today (-91.8%).
‚ö†Ô∏è
Alert Idea
:
Exchange Inflow Volume (7D-SMA)
rising above $750M/day may suggest a significant uptick in trade activity is underway, suggesting elevated volatility on the horizon.
Live Advanced Chart
Another useful proxy for assessing network utilization is the absolute value of Realized Profit and Loss events. This provides insight into the capital flows in or out of the asset, as coins are revalued higher, or lower. The combined Realized Profit and Loss is trading around the lowest levels seen over the last 3 years.
This suggests that the majority of holders with large profits, or losses, are unwilling to spend.
Live Professional Workbench
Unrealized Potential
We have established that both the nominal and realized network throughput remains cyclically low. This may be due to many market participants having a cost basis which is quite close to the current price, thus indicating there is minimal incentive to spend just yet. Participants may require greater volatility, in in either direction, to entice spending behavior.
The Adjusted Realized Price provides an improved model for estimating this market wide cost-basis. It works by removing the tremendous unrealized profits held by long-dormant (and likely lost) coins (> 7y), isolating the economically active and more price sensitive cohort of holders.
Spot prices are currently trading just above the Adjusted Realized Price ($25.2k), which is likely a psychological area of interest in the event of a pullback. This also firms up the thesis that there is simply not a great deal of profit (or loss) available to be taken by the active participants in the market.
‚ö†Ô∏è
Alert Idea:
Price breaking below $25.2k would indicate a retest of the cost basis for the economically active supply is underway, being a key psychological price level to watch.
Live Advanced Workbench
The recent rally above $30k saw the Adjusted MVRV Ratio rise to a value of 1.21, suggesting a fairly modest 21% unrealized profit level was reached.
Currently, the aMVRV is recording a value of 1.09, suggesting just 9% unrealized profit remains within in the market. This is coincident with what were historically oversold levels in both the 2018, 2019 and March 2020 cycle lows.
Live Advanced Workbench
Supply Stays Still
Despite the blistering start to the year across the digital asset landscape, the BTC supply held for longer than 1yr+ continues to push to new highs. The chart below shows four subsets of this dormant supply as a proportion of the total circulating supply:
üî¥ Supply Last Active 1+ Yrs Ago: 68.1%
üü° Supply Last Active 2+ Yrs Ago: 55.2%
üü¢ Supply Last Active 3+ Yrs Ago: 40.0%
üîµ Supply Last Active 5+ Yrs Ago: 28.9%
The remarkable level of HODLing across the supply continues, with such high coin inactivity supporting the extreme lows of on-chain volume throughput.
Live Advanced Workbench
This phenomena is also reflected across Long-Term Holder Supply (coins held > 155-days), which is at a new ATH of 14.46M BTC. This reflects coins acquired immediately after the FTX failure maturing into LTH status.
Live Professional Workbench
Confluence can be found in the Liveliness metric, which compares the relative balance between HODLing and spending behavior. Currently, network Liveliness is descending to the lowest value recorded since the Dec 2020 breakout above $20K. Persistent downtrends in Liveliness reaffirm that HODLing is certainly the current primary market dynamic across the majority of supply.
Live Advanced Chart
If we look to the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort, we can assess the amount of ‚Äòholding time‚Äô being spent by this group (measured as coinday destruction over the last 90-days). By this metric, STH coinday destruction is extremely low, and significantly below the two large panic capitulation events occurring in June, and November 2022.
This infers that STHs are generally reluctant to spend within the current price range, and require greater volatility, and likely higher prices (realizing profits) as an incentive.
Overall, these metrics paint a relatively constructive view of Bitcoin holder conviction, where most are simply not interested in spending their coins just yet.
Live Professional Workbench
Holders From Last Cycle Are Forged
Following the November low, the USD denominated wealth held within coins aged 2y-3y has expanded from 3.1% to 27.7%, as large swathes of supply mature across the 2yr boundary. This reflects supply that was acquired after the May 2021 sell-off from $56k to $29k.
The chart below shows the changing proportion of USD wealth held in these age bands:
üü¢ Wealth Held by 2y-3y: 3.1% to 27.7% (up +24.6%)
üü° Wealth Held by 1y-2y: 43.5% to 28.3 (down -15.2%)
üü† Wealth Held by 6m-1y: 25.5% to 10.6% (down -14.9%)
We can also utilize a new variant of the RHODL Ratio, comparing the wealth held in 2y+, to those in the 6m-2y age band. This helps us evaluate the balance between experienced (2yr+) and single cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-2y).
Currently, this RHODL variant is climbing exponentially, suggesting a significant portion of holders from the 2021-22 cycle are maturing into the experienced HODLers. Given the extraordinary, and mostly downside volatility experienced over this period, it demonstrates that the Bitcoin holder base remains incredibly resolute, which is a noteworthy, and likely constructive observation.
Summary and Conclusions
One of the great assets of on-chain analysis is our ability to observe both sides of holder behavior; their willingness to hold, and their willingness to spend. What we continue to observe is that the conviction of existing Bitcoin holders remains remarkably high, despite the extreme the volatility and immense deleveraging over the last 2yrs.
It is important to highlight that volume throughput is very low right now, indicating an arguably lackluster inflow of new demand, as well as growing dominance by low volume ordinal/inscription transactions. However, this is matched by an existing holder base who can be argued are increasingly price insensitive.
Given 2022 provided no shortage of reasons to panic, capitulate, and otherwise exit the market, the ageing of coins into multi-year age bands is noteworthy. It suggests a case where those who survived 2022, may require higher prices before opening up their cold storage wallets."

Diminishing Momentum
As momentum slows down in the Bitcoin market, the
Monthly Realized Volatility
has dropped to 34.1%, which is below the 1-standard deviation
Bollinger Band
. Historically, such low-volatility regimes only account for 19.3% of market history, and therefore expectations of elevated volatility on the near-term horizon is a logical conclusion.

Transfer volumes on-chain remain cyclically low (
WoC 21
), which translates into a decline in activity associated with exchanges. To quantify this concept, we can compare the average number of exchange deposit/withdrawal transactions happening this week, to the 6-month median, producing an activity ratio.
We can see the cyclical trend of exchange activity for
All Exchanges
üü¶, and note that recent activity has dropped -27.3% relative to the last six months. To account for FTX, which completely ceased operations in Nov 2022, we can see a similar activity momentum for Binance only üü®, suggesting investor activity is indeed exceptionally light.
Live Advanced Workbench
Mapping Out An Equilibrium
The lower volatility, and declining on-chain activity all point towards a sort of equilibrium phase. We will now leverage the
Net Unrealized Profit/Loss
(NUPL)
metric to verify this hypothesis.
This indicator examines the dollar value of the total net profit or loss as a percentage of the market cap. From a macro perspective, we can define four phases in a cycle:
Bottom Discovery
üî¥: NUPL < 0
Capitulation and Recovery
üü†: 0 < NUPL < 0.25
Equilibrium Phase
üü°: 0.25 < NUPL < 0.5
Bull Market Euphoria
üü¢: 0.5 < NUPL
The current
NUPL
value of 0.29 is at the lower bound of the equilibrium phase, which is a zone where 37.5% of all Bitcoin trading days have been. This zone was reached in early March 2023, and persisted for around 16 months in the last two cycles.
üîî
Alert Idea
: NUPL (7-day SMA) breaking below 0.25 would indicate that market profitability has declined back into the Capitulation and Recovery phase, and may suggest weakness.
Live Advanced Chart
Psychological Ranges
We can also utilize a set of investor cost basis to bound the likely boundaries of near-term volatility. The goal is to find price levels which are likely to elicit a significant psychological response from a larger proportion of holders.
The
Active Investor Cost Basis
üîµ is currently trading at $33.5k, which accounts only for investors actively participating in the market, and provides a near-term upper bound price model. With the Active Investor
MVRV
at 0.83, it suggests that many 2021-22 cycle buyers are still underwater, and may be waiting for break-even prices to liquidate their holdings.
üîî
Alert Idea
: Price breaking above $33.5k would indicate that the average investor from the 2021-22 cycle is now back in profit, and reflects a psychological area of interest.
Live Advanced Workbench
A lower bound pricing model can also be identified, seeking an approximate macro support in the case of a significant market deterioration, such as the COVID Crash March of 2020. The
Investor Cap Price
model is calculated as the difference between the Realized Cap and the Thermocap, reflecting a floor model based on investor holdings, excluding miners.
We can see that the Investor Price model was briefly intersected during the March 2020 sell-off, and is currently trading at $17.65k. With
Investor Capital MVRV
currently at 1.58, it falls within a very similar equilibrium range to the 2019-20 mini-market cycle.
Live Advanced Workbench
The market seems to have little gravity pulling it in either direction at present. We can also see that prices have returned to the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, and reset several unrealized profit/loss metrics.
The
STH Unrealized Profit / Loss Ratio
(introduced in
WoC 18
) has cooled off significantly, returning to a break-even level of 1.0 and then bouncing back to 2.6. This indicates a balanced position of profit and loss for new investors. Falling below this level tends to precede a more extensive price contraction, however, the market tends to find support at this level during resilient bull runs.
Live Professional Workbench
The Road Higher
Having established that the market is in equilibrium, we can use on-chain tools to provide a macro roadmap of this phase from prior cycles.
The first tool tracks the
Supply
side of
Long-Term Holders (LTH)
. We can see that Long-Term Supply tends to be quite cyclical, and we have highlighted various regimes of strong spending üî¥, and strong holding üü¢ patterns on the chart below.
Before reclaiming the ATH, the Long-term holder supply goes through a lengthy re-accumulation period, with a generally flat, to a modest rise in aggregate supply held.
As the market breaks the previous cycle ATH, the incentive to ramp up spending increases significantly. This results in a dramatic decline in LTH supply, transferring coins to newer buyers, at expensive prices.
Throughout the 2022 bear market, the first phase LTH supply pattern has played out exactly, showing the remarkable resilience of BTC holders amidst extreme volatility.
Live Professional Chart
We can use these observations to build a tool that gauges market sentiment. First, we will break the long and rocky road between bear market lows, and the last cycle ATH into three sub-intervals:
Bottom Discovery
üü•: Price below Long-Term Holders Cost Basis.
Equilibrium
üüß: ¬†Price is above Long-Term Holders Cost Basis. but below the previous ATH.
Price Discovery
üü©: ¬†Price is above the last cycle ATH.
Next, we overlay market performance with the intensity of LTH spending (usually associated with either profit-taking, or capitulation). Here, we display LTH spending via the Spending Binary Indicator (SBI), which simply tracks whether LTH spending is of an intensity sufficient to decrease the total LTH Supply, averaged over the last 7-days.
Live Professional Workbench
From this, we can see that LTH spending was been extremely light over recent weeks, but has ticked higher during this correction. The Indicator reached a level suggesting 4-of-7 days experienced a net divestment by LTHs, which is a level similar to exit liquidity events seen YTD.
Live Professional Workbench
To wrap up, we can merge these two indicators to construct a new tool for breaking up market sentiment into four sub-categories, and spotting periods of elevated LTH divestment:
Capitulation
üü•: Spot price is lower than the LTH cost basis and therefore any strong spending ¬†is likely due to financial pressure and capitulation
(Conditions: LTH-MVRV < 1 and SBI > 0.55).
Transition
üüß: Market is trading slightly above the long-term holders cost basis, and occasional light spending is part of day-to-day trade
(Conditions: 1.0 < LTH-MVRV < 1.5 ¬†and SBI > 0.55)
.
Equilibrium
üü®: After recovering from a prolonged bear, the market seeks a new balance between minimal in-flowing demand, lighter liquidity, and underwater holders from the previous cycle. Strong LTH spending during this stage is usually associated with sudden rallies or corrections (Conditions: 1.5 < LTH-MVRV < 3.5
and SBI > 0.55
).
Euphoria
üü©: As LTH-MVRV reaches 3.5 (historically aligned with the market hitting the prior ATH), LTHs are holding upwards of 250% profit on average. The market enters a euphoria phase, which motivates these investors to spend at very high, and accelerating rates (Conditions: ¬†LTH-MVRV > 3.5 and
SBI = 1.00
).
Our current market has recently reached the Transition phase, flagging a local uptick in LTH spending this week. Depending on what direction volatility erupts next, we can employ this tool to locate local periods of overheated conditions, as observed from the lens of Long-Term Holders.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The digital asset market continues to outperform major commodities in 2023, however all are currently experiencing a meaningful correction. Having recovered from the depths of the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin investors find themselves in a form of equilibrium, with little gravity in either direction.
Given the extremely low volatility, and narrow trading ranges of late, it seems this equilibrium is soon to be disturbed. In response, we have seen a modest uptick in Long-Term Holder spending, and developed a suite of price levels, and behavior patterns to monitor as the situation unfolds."
2023,23,2023-W23,2023-06-05,2023-06-11,Bearish,25741.50,25937.02,26302.26,0.76,Disagree,"The quiet and calm persists in digital asset markets, with the price of ETH remaining confined to a $68 range this week (3.6%), trading between a low of $1,861 and a high of $1,931. Aside from a small surge in ETH markets following the Shanghai upgrade, ETH prices have been more or less flat since mid March.
As the market grinds sideways, there are growing divergences in market preference occurring beneath the surface, many hinting at a risk-off environment. Trade volumes remain depressed, DeFi usage has becoming increasingly automated, and a market preference is growing for stablecoins, specifically for Tether (USDT).
In this edition, we will explore these developing undercurrents, and how we can observe them through on- and off-chain data.
Automated Arbitrage
Whilst ETH prices have remained relatively flat and range-bound since March, gas prices did experience a non-trivial uptick in the month of May. Gas prices increased to an average gas price of 76 Gwei, equating to $1.14 for a regular ETH transfer transaction. Mean gas price reached over 155 Gwei in early May ($6.53 per ETH transfer), which is almost as high as during the 2021-22 bull cycle.
Live Chart
Smart contract interactions are more gas intensive and can cost multiples of a simple transfer. Gas usage associated with DeFi protocols rose 270% in late April, pushing daily gas consumption by the sector above 20B gas units.
Live Advances Chart
If we break down DeFi gas by protocol, we quickly determine that the primary uplift in activity is driven by trading activity on decentralized exchanges. Uniswap remains the primary venue, seeing a 388% increase in gas usage since April, and now accounts for between 7.7% and 14.4% of total Ethereum gas demand.
Live Professional Chart
Those who follow the news might assume that this increase in activity is due to the recent Memecoin hype, which revolved around tokens such as PEPE and HEX. However, a more detailed analysis of trading volume on Uniswap paints a more detailed picture.
The chart below shows the top traded pools on Uniswap, revealing that the highest volumes over the past 30 days were primarily related to larger market cap assets like ETH, stablecoins, WBTC and the Coinbase's staking derivative cbETH.
After comparing the addresses of the top 10 traders with our labels, we found that all but one were associated with MEV bots. With the infamous MEV-bot jaredfromsubway.eth making over USD 3B in trading volume during the past month.
Whilst it requires further research to determine how many of the global pool of traders are bots, the volume size generated by the top ten already gives us an idea of how much of Uniswap's volume may in fact be automated arbitrage.
One way to rationalize this is to consider the exponential scope of arbitrage opportunities available across Ethereum DEXs:
As the price of each token (+ slippage) changes, eventually the gas fee will justify an arbitrage transaction.
Each DEX pool hosting that token provides a venue for an arbitrage transaction.
Thus, the number of potential arbitrage transaction opportunities will grow exponentially, related to both the number of DEX liquidity pools, and the number of tokens available to trade.
If we take into account that many bots engage in arbitrage or sandwich attacks, the degree of 'organic' trading volume on Uniswap may well account for over two-thirds of all DEX activity.
While the activities of these trading bots may be considered harmful for end-users of Ethereum, it does have benefits for Ethereum validators. In the past month, validators not only earned higher rewards due to increased priority fees, but also benefited from MEV-boost payments. These payments are collected from traders and bots who pay to have their transactions ordered in the most profitable way within a block.
In many ways, this highlights an increasingly favourable trend for staked ETH as a primary asset within the Ethereum ecosystem. This also establishes a native hurdle rate which tokens must compete with in order to attract capital flows.

Risk-Off Rotation
There are also strong indications of capital rotation moving lower on the risk curve, shifting towards stablecoins and BTC as liquidity lightens. If we start with Ethereum Futures markets, we can obtain a view into market participants beyond the crypto-native traders usually found on decentralized exchanges.
After the FTX collapse, futures trade volume collapsed to just ~$7.5B/day. Volumes have seen a comeback in 2023, however the 30-day average ($12.0B/day) remains well below the yearly average ($21.5B/day).
Unlike the uptick in Uniswap trading activity, futures trading has continued to contract through May, indicating that institutional trading interest and liquidity remains quite weak.
Live Advanced Chart
We can see a supporting trend in the relative volume dominance between BTC and ETH in perpetual swap markets. Whilst trade volume between both assets reached parity in late 2022, Ethereum's relative share of futures volume has decreased massively in 2023.
ETH currently represents 34.5% of trade volume between the two majors, suggesting liquidity is moving down the risk curve, and preferring to concentrate in BTC markets on a relative basis.
Live Workbench Chart
On-chain data provides another view into capital flows and rotation within crypto markets. The chart below compares the total USD denominated value of ETH vs stablecoins flowing in and out of exchanges. During the massive ¬†deleveraging in 2022, a noticeable shift in investor preference developed, with ETH dominance in capital flows declining from ~35% to 10%.
In 2023, we observed a strong reversal, with ETH's proportion of exchange flows rising back to 25%. However, this trend stalled in early May, suggesting a potential change in risk appetite. Investors who benefited from the strong first quarter returns, may be starting to transition capital back towards stablecoins.

Another way to firm up this conclusion is by comparing the daily exchange inflows of each asset as a measure of buy-side and sell-side pressure. For this simplified model, we assume that BTC+ETH exchange inflows represent sell-side pressure, whilst and Stablecoin inflows represent buy-side pressure.
Negative values suggest that we have seen a net sell-side regime since the beginning of April 2023, where inflows of BTC+ETH started to exceed those of stablecoins. This is a distinct break from the significant buy-side pressure seen in Q1, with buy-side weakening in early April, which coincided with the start of the prevailing market correction.
Live Workbench Chart
Generally speaking, capital tends to flow into digital assets through the two majors, BTC and ETH, or via stablecoins. Therefore, we can estimate the direction of aggregate capital flows by aggregating and comparing two metrics:
Realized Cap for BTC and ETH (being the net change in value for coins moved on-chain)
Circulating supply for stablecoins (considering USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, and DAI)
From this, we can see that capital flows into the crypto markets has been primarily driven by an uptick in capital flows into BTC (+$4.47B/mth), followed by ETH (+$3.5B/mth). However this has been offset in part by around -$1.2B in capital outflows from stablecoins, as significant redemptions take place within the stablecoin sector.
Live Workbench Chart
Recent stablecoins capital outflows are driven primarily by the second (USDC), and third (BUSD) largest assets, seeing supplies fall in 2023 by -$15.7B and $-11.5B, respectively. USDT has absorbed a significant proportion of these flows, pushing to a new ATH supply of $83.1B.
It is likely that this reflects a geographical divergence, with US regulated entities historically having expressed a preference for USDC over USDT.
Live Chart
We will close out by noting that a similar divergence is visible in the year-over-year BTC supply change based on geographical regions. The extreme dominance of US entities in 2020-21 has clearly reversed, with US supply dominance falling by 11% since mid-2022. European markets have been fairly neutral over the last year, whilst a significant increase in supply dominance is visible across Asian trading hours.

Summary and Conclusions
Over the past month, there has been increased activity on decentralized exchanges, particularly on Uniswap. Although one may think Memecoins had sparked this activities, a closer look reveals most of the volume was generated on larger and deeper WETH-Stablecoin pools. Remarkably, only a fraction of this trading actvities seems to have been organic, suggesting it is primarily arbitrage, MEV, and algorithmic trading.
Given US interest rates are now over 5%, non-interest-bearing stablecoins have become less attractive, especially to investors with access to US capital markets. Tether on the other hand has historically found wider adoption in markets outside the US, where national currencies are often weaker, and access to USD less common. Similarly, as an increasingly hostile regulatory environment is established in the US, capital appears to be flowing out, and eastward in the digital asset sector.
Much of this hints to a generally risk-off environment, with the remaining capital concentrating in the more liquid majors, and a growing preference for stablecoin capital."

. Both filed complaints pertain to the listing and trading tokens that the SEC deems to be unregistered securities, as well as claims that the offered earn and staking services are also in violation of securities laws. For Binance, the charges extend further, alleging that the entity engaged in wash trading, and has commingled customer funds between on-shore and off-shore entities.
As news of the Binance charges broke on 5-June, digital asset markets traded lower, with ETH down -5.4%, and BTC down -6.8%. Both assets recovered these losses as news of the Coinbase charges landed on 6-June. However, by the end of the week ETH had sold off further, down -8.2%, whilst BTC held up slightly better at -6.4%.
Given the gravity of the charges against the two largest exchanges, and an increasingly hostile US regulatory environment, we will focus on the investor response, with a specific lens on exchange activity. By inspecting the breakdown of exchange activity, we are seeking evidence that suggests any negative shifts in investor sentiment.

Exchange Outflows
Immediately after the Binance headlines broke, coins started to flow out of the exchange. The chart below displays the 2-week view of Binance's exchange reserves for the major assets; BTC, ETH, and stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD).
Over the last 7-days, investors have withdrawn their assets at a steady pace, with aggregate stablecoin balances down over $1.6B, equivalent to 20.9% of the total Binance balance. BTC and ETH reserves are down a more modest 5.7% and 7.1%, respectively.
Live Professional Chart
Whilst net outflows have occurred at Binance, we must keep in mind that the exchange still holds some of the largest reserves of any entity on-chain, and their BTC and ETH balances are still quite substantial.
Binance stablecoin reserves display the largest decline of note, having fallen precipetously from over $26.0B in November 2022, to just $6.5B today (a 75% decline). This is driven in part by prior SEC complaints against BUSD, causing issuer Paxos to enter redemption-only mode (
WoC 14
).
Live Professional Chart
For Coinbase, net reserve changes are far less dramatic, with stablecoin balances remaining flat on the week, and BTC balances declining by just 2,300 BTC (0.5% of total).
Ether balances however did see a very large 291k ETH decline, equivalent to around 8.0% of the total balance. This suggests a more pronounced investor response, perhaps related to the offered staking services coming under fire.

Breakdown of Exchange Deposits by Cohort
Analysing the breakdown of exchange withdrawals by USD size shows an interesting divergence in investor behavior this week:
Transactions

$10M in size
have seen consistent withdrawals, with a net outflow of over $130M/day maintained all week.
Transactions
above
$10M in size
have seen consistent deposits, with inflow rates ranging between $15M and $30M/day.
This suggests that very large entities (such as institutions) are more affected to a greater extent by the SEC news as compared to smaller entities. It remains to be seen if this becomes a more sustained trend over coming weeks.

The chart below overlays BTC exchange deposit and withdrawal volumes, demonstrating how flows in both directions tend to track each other very closely. This week was no exception, with flows in, and out increasing by around 70% to $845M/day.
Withdrawals on aggregate have outpaced deposits by around 10% this week, suggesting that self-custody remains a preferred strategy for investors overall. A similar dynamic was observed around the last major exchange related news, being the collapse of FTX (
WoC 46-2022
).
Live Advanced Chart
Focusing on aggregate deposit volumes, we can establish a breakdown by cohort type. We can thus identify which investor groups have reacted most significantly to the news:
üî¥ Short-Term Holders account for 76.4% of deposit volume (23.0k BTC)
üîµ Long-Term Holders account for just 1.9% of deposit volume (570 BTC)
üü¢ Inter-Exchange Transfers account for 21.7% of deposit volume (6.53k BTC)
STHs historically account for a stable ~60% of deposit flows, which suggests recent buyers have been the most active this week. Inter-exchange flows are typically around 35%, suggesting that investors on the margin are preferring to take self-custody, rather than simply transferring coins to a different exchange.
Live Professional Chart
The chart below confirms the first observation, with the STH cohort sending 0.93% of their total held balance into exchanges this week. Whilst not yet above the 1% threshold we often see associated with high volatility events, it is a notable uptick relative to 2021-22 cycle baseline.

Realized Apathy
Whilst the charts above point to a subset of recent buyers sending coins into exchanges this week, the deeper picture is even more intriguing. The chart below shows the total Realized Profit, or Loss locked in by exchange deposits, and what we can see is that both sides are relatively small.
Of all the coins flowing into of exchanges, very few of them are locking in any appreciable profit, or loss. In other words, most coins sent to exchanges, were acquired at a price very close to the current spot rate, and likely acquired recently given the dominance of Short-Term Holders.
This speaks to a degree of both confidence (investors are unshaken by the news in aggregate), but also apathy (the current price range isn't sufficient incentive to spend).

With such extreme lows in realized profit or loss, the sell-side risk ratio has fallen towards all-time-lows. This metric compares the aggregate profit/loss locked in by the market relative to the asset size (the Realized Cap).
The total value of profit and loss being locked in is extremely small relative to the current Bitcoin Realized Cap of $391B. Low values of the Sell-side Risk Ratio has historically occurred during periods of heightened investor apathy, typically on the back-side of deep bearish trends.

Summary and Conclusions
The regulatory environment in the US remains hostile, with the SEC filing very significant charges against the two largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The balances of major assets on these two exchanges have declined this week, as a portion of customers withdraw out of concern. With the exception of stablecoins at Binance, the declines are well within typical patterns, and it remains to be seen how investors react as both lawsuits play out.
In the immediate term, it appears that many recent BTC buyers (STHs) have sent their coins into exchanges, likely for sale, to de-risk their position. More broadly however, the remarkably low realized profit and loss that was locked in, and almost non-existent reaction by Long-Term Holders suggests that many investors were hardly surprised by the news."

Volatility, volume, and realized value are at multi-year lows, suggesting liquidity is increasingly thin, and investor apathy is now firmly in play.
The undercurrent of BTC supply continues to flow out of exchanges, miners and and whale wallets, and towards HODLer entities of all sizes at a healthy rate.
Comparisons to past cycles suggests that the market is likely within a transitional period, characterized by investor apathy, and boredom. However, the halving event creeps ever closer, now just 305-days away.

The Road to Nowhere
This week, the Bitcoin market experienced price swings in both directions, however made little progress overall. The market traded down to $24.8k early in the week, rallied to $26.7k on news of the ETF application by Blackrock, before returning almost back to the opening at $26.3k. Whilst prices were volatile intra-week, on the broader scale, the market remains on a road to nowhere.
If we compare the the 30-day price range, we can see that quiet periods like this are few and far in between. The majority tend to occur during the apathetic hangover period that follows a bear market, aligning with our observations of market apathy last week (

Naturally, this is also reflected across 1-month Realized Volatility, which has reset to 39.6%, one of the lowest recordings since the 2021 bull market. We can see such events are typically experienced during the long, sideways grind as the market finds its feet after a prolonged bearish trend.

Implied volatility across option contracts from 1-week, to 6-months out have also reached a cycle lows. Near-term 1-week implied volatility is at the second lowest value (36%) on record, whilst 3-month and 6-month contracts are at all-time-lows of 42% and 46%, respectively.

Trading volumes in futures markets have also declined to $20.9B/day as liquidity across digital asset markets continues to drain.

A similar story is true on-chain, we can see the absolute value of profit and loss taking events has declined to cycle lows of $268M. This returns to October 2020 levels (BTC prices were ~$10k), highlighting just how quiet capital flows have been both in and out of the asset class year to date.

HODLers Are HODLing
We have established that digital asset liquidity is very thin across both the on-chain and off-chain domains. In the next section, we shall investigate how this translates across to the behavior of existing market participants.
Liveliness provides a big picture view into the propensity of Bitcoin holders to spend or hold their coins. Currently, Liveliness is in a multi-year macro downtrend, having peaked in May 2021 when bear market first set in. We can see a similar structure has formed to the 2018-20 cycle, as coins slowly but surely migrate into cold storage and are removed from the market by the HODLer cohort.
Live Professional Chart
These HODLers are currently accumulating coins at a rate of around 42.2K BTC/month, suggesting that the price insensitive class are absorbing a non-trivial portion of the currently available supply.
If we compare this behavior to prior cycles, we can see that this regime of steady and gradual accumulation commenced just over 2-years ago, and suggests that another 6 to 12-months may be ahead of us.
Live Professional
Chart
This observation is further supported by the divergence between exchange balances, and the volume of coins held in illiquid wallets, being those with little to no history of spending. Illiquid supply reached a new ATH of 15.2M BTC this week, whilst exchange balances have fallen to the lowest levels since Jan 2018 at 2.3M BTC.
Live Professional Workbench
Around 146K BTC/month are currently flowing into these illiquid wallets, supporting the case for a gradual and steady accumulation taking place.
Live
Professional
Chart
To get a sense of scale, we can compare the balance change of various wallet size cohorts to the volume of new coins issued to miners.
By this relative measure, we can see that entities with a balance under 100 BTC are increasing their holdings meaningfully, absorbing an equivalent to 254% of mined supply over the last month (2.54 x ~900 BTC/day = 2,286 BTC/day).

Overall, the market appears to be in a period of quiet accumulation, which suggests an undercurrent of demand, despite the regulatory headwinds of late.

An Arduous Road Ahead
In an attempt to find a yardstick for what may lie on the road ahead, we can gauge previous market phases on the basis of duration. The chart below shows number of days spent in the following phases:
üîµ
Bull Market
measured from cycle low until cycle peak.
üî¥
Bear Market
measured from cycle peak to cycle low.
‚ö´
Transition
measured from cycle ATL until setting a new ATH.
If we assume the lows established in Nov 2022 hold, we can argue that the market has been within a transitional period for 221 days. Past transitional periods lasted between 459 days, and 770 days, suggesting that the patience of investors may be tested, on the order of 8 to 18-months, until a new market ATH, if history is any guide.
Like Advanced Workbench
These transitional periods tend to see prices bounded between the Realized Price üü†, and the Realized Price + 0.5 standard deviation band üîµ. Since setting each cycle low, the following proportion of trading days have been between these boundaries:
2012-13 Cycle
= 79%
2015-17 Cycle
= 64%
2019-21 Cycle
= 78%
This framework would suggest a price range between $20.1k (-23%) to the downside, and $45.0k (+71%) to the upside over this period.
Like Advanced Workbench
With the Bitcoin halving just 305-days away, we can also see the relationship between these transitional periods and halving events, which tend to occur around two-thirds of the way through the journey.
Like Advanced Workbench
From this, we can index the price performance of prior epochs, starting at 305-days from the halving. The range of prior market performance on the date of the halving are as follows:
üü† Epoch 1 = +126% with a max drawdown of -44.8%
üî¥ Epoch 2 = +179% with a max drawdown of -23.3%
üîµ Epoch 3 = -6.4% ¬†with a max drawdown of -53% in March 2020
The first two Epochs both saw very positive price appreciation, whilst the third Epoch was far more challenging for investors to navigate, not least with the exogenous shock of March 2020.
Like Advanced Workbench
Finally, we conclude our analysis with an assessment of price performance over the year that follows each halving event.
üî¥ Epoch 2 Price Performance: +7358% with a max drawdown of -69.4%
üîµ Epoch 3 Price Performance: +393% with a max drawdown of -29.6%
üü¢ Epoch 4 Price Performance: +366% with a max drawdown of -45.6%
A diminishing returns effect is clearly noted across Epochs, a natural expectation as the market size, and capital flows grow in size over time.

Summary and Conclusions
Across most measures of market energy, digital asset markets are displaying excitement in few of them. Volatility, volumes, and realized value are all at multi-year lows, as liquidity and excitement give way to investor apathy.
However beneath the surface, the classic pattern of wealth transfer towards the price insensitive HODLer cohort remains uninterrupted. If past cycles are any guide, it it suggests that a period of apathetic sideways boredom may well define the road ahead, potentially lasting between 8 to 18-months in duration."

Regional Sentiment Analysis
In recent weeks, the SEC has been applying pressure to the top two cryptocurrency exchanges in the US. However, this week saw a gold rush of spot Bitcoin ETF applications lead by Blackrock, the largest global asset manager. In response, BTC has rallied from $25k to over $31k, reaching new yearly highs.
The rally was led by traders in US üîµ, followed by traders in EU üü†, and lastly in Asia üî¥.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can explore a framework for these regional shifts by assessing coin flows through fiat on-ramping entities (exchanges). To achieve this, we have isolated the top three exchanges from the US and Asia regions as ranked by
CoinGecko
.
US (On-shore):
Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini
Asia (Off-shore):
Binance, OKX and Houbi
Focusing on the weekly average BTC netflow exposes some interesting patterns in their behavior. During the early stages of the 2020-2021 bull market, the LUNA debacle and FTX fallout led to a regime of strong accumulation and preference for self-custody. Most exchanges experienced 5k-10k BTC daily net outflows.
However, on multiple occasions, Binance demonstrated the opposite behavior, where large inflow volumes accompanied market sell-off events and downtrends. This may be, in part, investors moving holdings away from exchanges perceived as riskier (like FTX) and towards the largest exchange in the world.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also categorize exchanges based on their headquarters (On- vs Off-shore) and then aggregated the total netflows for each subcategory.
The following chart displays the monthly cumulative netflow for each region. We can observe that both regions saw net outflows (accumulation) during the bottom discovery phase between Nov-2022 and Jan-2023. Conversely, after the LUNA debacle, and for much of 2023, Off-shore exchanges have seen net inflows, whilst On-shore exchanges are seeing net outflows, as US based investors accumulate or stay neutral.
Observers can use this indicator to monitor regional market sentiment shifts as they react to external factors. For instance, after the SEC lawsuit against BinanceUS and Coinbase was announced, both regions reacted to price correction via notable exchange outflows. Currently, off-shore exchanges are showing -37.7k BTC/month in net outflows, while buying pressure in on-shore exchanges has declined to -3.2k BTC/month.

Gauging Demand Via Hot Supply
Our recent newsletters highlighted the ongoing transfer of wealth from investors with high time preferences towards HODLers. This pattern of growing illiquidity is a primary component of all prior Bitcoin bull markets. However, while a ‚Äòsupply shock‚Äô can positively affect price discovery, the sustainability of the trend still depends on the influx of new demand entering the market.
Given the demand side importance, we seek to establish a framework for tracing demand expansion (or contraction) using on-chain metrics. To achieve this goal, we will measure the momentum of supply, which is highly active as a proxy representation of demand.
üí° Quantifying capital flows can be measured from changes in the size of the highly-active region of circulating supply.
In other words, when new demand enters the market, existing investors usually react by transacting and distributing their coins at higher prices. The spending of older coins üü¶, therefore, necessitates an expansion of the younger supply üü• region.
Live Professional Workbench
We start by defining ‚Äòyoung supply‚Äô as all coins moved within the last 155 days (Short-Term Holders), which have a high probability of being spent in the near-term. However, we can look deeper and isolate only the most liquid and highly active subset of the young supply region, which we will define as ‚ÄòHot Supply.‚Äô
Hot Supply
is a subdivision of young supply which has a Velocity of one or higher. A velocity of more than one means, on average, each coin in that region moves more than once per day.
Using the following formula, we can calculate the velocity of any arbitrary subdivision of coins
i
.
Velocity_i = Daily Volume_i / Supply Size_i
The chart below shows the all-time-average velocity for the following markets:
Perpetual Futures Market
üîµ (velocity = trade volume divided by open interest).
Spot Market (<1w coins)
üî¥ (velocity = on-chain volume divided by supply < 1wk).
Spot Market (<1m coins)
üü† (velocity = on-chain volume divided by supply < 1m).
The velocity of both perpetual futures markets, and supply < 1wk is more than one. If we consider coins from the next age bracket (1 month), velocity drops below one, reinforcing the notion that older coins have a lower probability of spending.
Live Advanced Workbench
To put the magnitude of this
Hot Supply
üü• into perspective, this supply region is presented against
Perpetual Open Interest
üü™,
Total Circulating Supply
üüß and
(Probably) Lost Supply
‚¨õ. The interesting takeaway is that throughout the whole history of Bitcoin, the pricing process has been driven by a relatively small fraction of the total circulating supply.
Live Advanced Workbench
With a median size of 0.67M BTC and a maximum of 2.2M BTC,
Hot Supply
represents between 3.5% to 11.3% of the total supply. This is comparable to the volume of probably lost coins (1.46M BTC ~ 7.2%), being those that have not transacted since Bitcoins first traded price in July-2010.
Perpetual Futures Open Interest (472k BTC) and Hot Supply (511k BTC) are also similar in size as shown below, suggesting that a volume of around 983k BTC (~$29.5B) is currently ‚Äòavailable‚Äô for sale, with just under half of this being spot BTC.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also demonstrate the interrelation between price action, and changes in these Hot Supply and Perpetual Open Interest components. The chart below looks at the 90-day
Net Position Change
in these regions, where we can identify the direction and magnitude of capital flow into üü• and out of üü© the market.
Throughout past bull markets and severe capitulation events, between 250k to 500k BTC in value is typically deployed into the market. During prolonged bear markets, a similar magnitude of volume is accumulated and taken off-market long enough to exit this
Hot Supply
cohort (acquired and held by HODLers).
Live Advanced Workbench
The impact on price action arising from these expansions in hot supply is shown in the chart below. There have been seven major waves of capital inflow over the last 5yrs, ranging in magnitude from 400k BTC to 900k BTC per quarter. These were associated with market moves of between 26% to 154%.
From this chart, we can also compare the potential impact of the liquidation of major supply sources such as the Mt. Gox funds (137k BTC) and confiscated bitcoin held by US government (204k BTC). From this, we can see that a single quarter of similar demand inflows may be capable of absorbing the full distribution from both sources.

Summary and Conclusions
As a gold rush of institutional-grade ETF applications are filed in the US, we have seen early signs of a revival of US-led demand. This comes after a period of weaker relative US demand in 2023, with top exchanges in Asia seeing the strongest accumulation year to date.
With the prospect of a new large acquirer of spot BTC on the table, we developed a framework for assessing the available volume of BTC supply, and a toolkit to assess the expansion (or contraction) of new demand.
We close by examining the behavior of the Short-Term Holder cohort, and observe that their market psychology appears to have shifted from the bear market blues of 2022. Their actions speak to a newfound perception of ‚Äòbreak-even‚Äô levels as an opportunity to add to positions, rather than to liquidate into whatever exit liquidity is available."

The introduction of Ethereum's staking withdrawal functionality in mid-April has sparked a surge in interest for liquid staking tokens.
Among liquid staking providers, Lido has established overwhelming dominance, boasting the highest supply, liquidity, and integration network effects, all of which solidify its position in the market.
A new trend has evolved in regard to the DeFi integration of liquid staking tokens. Liquidity pools associated with liquid staking are witnessing a decline in locked value, as capital migrates towards use as collateral in lending protocols.
Relative Performance
The digital asset market has been processing the slew of spot BTC ETF applications over recent weeks, with notable BTC out-performance relative to the rest of the market. Whilst the ETF filing by BlackRock initially lifted The ETH price by 11.2%, it has closed Q2 a surprisingly quiet 6.4% above its April open.
On a relative basis, many digital assets have lost ground against Bitcoin in 2023, with the ETH/BTC ratio sliding down to a 50-week low of 0.060. This ratio has rallied back to 0.063 however, showing some strength into the start of July.

Thus far in 2023, the uptick in ETH prices have not yet translated into significantly increased network activity. Gas prices, which are considered a proxy for blockspace demand, have remained relatively low, especially in the week following the ETF filing announcements. For comparison, during the Shanghai upgrade in April, which preceded a similar rally in ETH markets, gas prices rose by 78%, compared the the 28% this week.
Live Workbench Chart
Waves of New Staking Deposits
The Shanghai hardfork enabled staked ETH to be withdrawn from the Ethereum consensus mechanism. Rather than seeing a wave of withdrawals however, instead the upgrade has motivated a fresh wave of deposits, as stakers find confidence in this new flexibility.
Deposit activity (transaction counts) reached a peak on 2-June, recording over 13,595 new deposits (worth over 408k ETH). For comparison, we can compare this to ETH exchange deposit transactions, which have remained flat at around 30k deposits transactions over this period.
Live Workbench Chart
The burst of new staked ETH is even clearer if we compare ETH volume staked (blue) vs exchange inflow volume (red). Newly staked ETH has been higher, or equal in scale to exchange inflows since Shanghai went live.
Live Workbench Chart
Upon closer examination, we can isolate daily deposits by provider, where a very clear trend in favor of liquid staking providers becomes evident, with Lido is leading this trend.
Lido Dominance
The above observations reflect a market demand for liquid staking tokens (LSTs). These tokens are effectively a wrapper for ETH deposited into the staking pool, with the staking operations abstracted away from the end user by the platform.
Lido released its V2 update on 15-May which allowed node operators to withdraw staked ETH, enabling holders of Lido's stETH token to exchange it for ETH. Following the release, there was a redemption of 400k stETH ($721M), resulting in a contraction of the stETH supply. However, the huge wave of new ETH deposits have more than compensated the decline, pushing to a new ATH of 7.49M stETH.
When comparing to other liquid staking competitors, Lido stands out as the clear leader in the sector with its supply 16 times higher than its nearest competitor. That said, the supply of rETH, which is the liquid staking token of Rocketpool, has been growing three times faster than Lido's since the beginning of this year.
Interestingly, the increasing demand for Lido's stETH is not reflected in an increasing number of new token holders. While we observe an increase in users of the staking tokens of Rocketpool and FRAX after the Shanghai upgrade, Lido has not registered a significant growth in new users.
New addresses holding stETH is oscillating between 230-590/day, which is more or less unchanged YTD. This leads us to the conclusion that many new deposits made via Lido are driven by existing stETH token holders increasing their exposure.
Live Workbench Chart
When looking at the average token holder balance, we can estimate how the newly issued stETH tokens have been distributed. After withdrawals were enabled for Lido, the average balance of token holders dropped to 46.1 stETH ($83k).
The average stETH balance has increased to 51.0 stETH ($100k) since Shanghai, indicating that existing token holders are indeed increasing their share of ETH staked in the form of stETH. It also suggests we are yet to see an appreciable influx of new holders entering the market via these staking mechanisms.
Live Workbench Chart
Shifting LST Usage in DeFi
A key value proposition of LSTs is their integration into DeFi protocols. LST token holders can easily trade LSTs on decentralized exchanges, use them as collateral, or take advantage of yield opportunities via lending protocols.
Since their inception, LSTs have seen increased activity within different DeFi protocols, with Lido's stETH being the most significant. The network effects and integrations of stETH is another factor leading to Lido dominance in the sector. However, amongst the suite of DeFi protocols accepting LSTs, there are several interesting trends developing.
Since the Shanghai Upgrade, the stETH-ETH Curve Pool, which is the largest liquidity pool for Lido's staking derivative, has lost 39% of its total value locked. It is now approaching the levels seen after the great deleveraging following the Terra-Luna collapse in May 2022.
Datasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode
Examining the wstETH-ETH Pool on Balancer, we can observe this trend is even more pronounced. Since 15-April the TVL of this pool has decreased by 71%, reducing the pool value from $351.2M to $101.4M.
Datasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode
By examining the annualized yield (APR) of both pools, we can see a consistent downtrend has been established in 2023. For our analysis, we take 15-April as the reference point as it is around that time when the wave of new staking deposits began, as well as the decrease in liquidity on the relevant DEXs.
The APR for the Curve stETH-ETH pool has decreased from 3.47% on April 15th to 2.27% today. On the other hand, the Balancer pool reached its lowest point of 1.69% in April and has slightly increased to 2.10% since then.
Keep in mind that APRs for liquidity pools are comprised of different reward structures paid in different tokens. The Lido project rewards Curve liquidity providers with LDO tokens on-top, with this incentive programme running out on 1-June. Given the contrasting APR trends on both platforms, this changing reward structure alone does not provide a conclusive explanation for the declining liquidity.
It may be that APRs have been rendered somewhat irrelevant for LST pools since the opening of withdrawals. Before Shanghai, liquidity pools functioned as the sole source of liquidity for stakers, however now the requirement to trade between stETH and ETH on DEXs has decreased, and users can mint or redeem directly with the platform.
This may alude to market makers seeing diminished return opportunities as DeFi liquidity providers. Moreover, this trend may have be reinforced by the retreat of several major market makers due to heightened regulatory scrutiny in the USA.
Datasource: Balancer, Curve. Adjusted by Glassnode
Since we do not see any sudden withdrawals of liquidity caused by the departure of a few players, but rather a continuous trend, we assume that these decreases in liquidity are likely due to more structural shifts.
Another explanation could be the increase in potential opportunity costs for liquidity providers resulting from new revenue streams across other DeFi protocols. Lending pools such as Aave or Compound which allow for LSTs can be used as collateral and leveraging them against ETH. This leveraged staking position is estimated to amplify yield by 3x.
Aave has seen an appreciable increase in TVL, especially for wstETH within the V3 lending pool. Since its launch in late January 2023, the wstETH pool has swelled to over S734.9M in value, whilst the stETH pool is hovering around $1.79B.
Datasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode
The Compound V3 wstETH pool has also seen significant growth since its launch earlier this year, now holding over $42.2M worth of stETH. This is an increase of 817% since 9-May alone. Yield-bearing staking derivatives appear to be becoming a more attractive collateral relative to ETH and even stablecoins.
Datasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode.
Summary and Conclusion
The Ethereum Shanghgai upgrade was completed in mid April, allowing investors to complete the withdrawal leg of the staking yield trade. Rather than witnessing a wave of withdrawals, deposits accelerated, with a very clear market preference for liquid staking tokens emerging.
Of these, Lido has captured by far the largest market share, accounting for 7.5M in staked ETH. Lido's stETH also has network effects within the DeFi sector, being integrated and adopted as a preferred source of collateral. Since Shanghai, there has been a notable shift in stETH capital allocation within the DeFi sector, with DEX liquidity pools shrinking, and collateral usage within in lending protocols rising.
This suggests that investors may be playing a staking yield maximising strategy, building up stETH exposure via borrowed leverage to amplify returns."

Holding Up OK
The Bitcoin market has held onto the majority of its 2023 gains thus far, rallying back above $31k in recent weeks. With the market consolidating near the yearly highs, we can compare this price performance to prior cycles, from both a bull and a bear market lens.
If we assume that the November 2022 lows are indeed the cycle floor, we can compare the depth of the 'bull market corrections' thus far. We can see that the peak drawdown in 2023 has been just -18%, which is remarkably shallow compared to all prior cycles. This perhaps suggests a relatively strong degree of demand underlies the asset.
Live Advanced Chart
If we instead put our bear market goggles on, we can assess 2023 performance indexed from the cycle ATH. From this vantage point, the powerful recovery from the November lows is up 91%, and carries a remarkable resemblance to the recovery rallies of prior cycles.
With the exception of 2019, all prior cycles which experienced a similar magnitude move off the bottom, were in fact the genesis point of a new cyclical uptrend.

Inscriptions Give Way to Investors
One of the most surprising events of 2023 has been the emergence of ordinals and inscriptions on Bitcoin. This phenomena has experienced two distinct waves of activity:
Wave 1:
Primarily image based inscriptions, leading to the emergence of NFT assets on Bitcoin. A total of 1.08M images have been inscribed thus far.
Wave 2:
Primarily high fee paying text based inscriptions associated with 'BRC-20 tokens'. Overall, Bitcoin now hosts 14.8M text based inscriptions.
By inscription count, Wave 2 was an order of magnitude larger, however activity has been in consistent decline since May. There has been a brief uptick in text inscriptions this week, however unconfirmed transactions across Bitcoin mempools are starting to clear overall.
Available in this Professional Dashboard
Inscriptions also forced a very intriguing development in our interpretation framework of on-chain activity metrics. Generally speaking, upticks in Bitcoin on-chain activity metrics are a signal of growing adoption and a healthy network (i.e. up is usually good to see).
However due to the significant address re-use (
WoC 20
), and very small transfer volumes (~10k sats) associated with inscriptions, periods of high demand now requires a slightly more nuanced interpretation, summarised in the following table.
With this in mind, we can see that as inscriptions cool off, active address momentum has started climbing again. Traditional interpretation would have seen the last 2-3 months as an implied decline in Bitcoin network activity. However the correct interpretation is that it was simply a product of significant address re-use by inscription traders, and network activity was actually booming, with blocks being packed full.
Live Advanced Chart
Transaction counts also reached a previously unattainable peak, with inscriptions taking advantage of the SegWit data discount. This meant that miners could fit more transaction data into each block, with some blocks even approaching the 4MB theoretical hard limit.
Daily transaction counts have also cooled off significantly in recent weeks, aligning with the slowdown in inscription activity.
Live Advanced Chart
After several months of network congestion, mempools are slowly but surely starting to clear, and on-chain transaction fees are coming off the boil. USD denominated transaction fees on Bitcoin are down over 96% since the height of the BRC-20 craze in May, with the average fee paid now at $1.33, with median fees down to $0.16.
Fee metrics, above all others, suggests an aggregate slowdown in on-chain activity is currently underway.
Live Advanced Chart
Whilst activity is cooling, BTC volumes which are being transferred are starting to pick up meaningfully. BTC changing hands has lifted 75% off the FTX lows, now reaching $4.2B per day in total settlement.
Live Professional Chart
If we isolate only exchange inflows and outflows, we see that the Bitcoin network is entering a period of positive momentum. The monthly average of exchange flows is now firmly above the yearly, a sign that has historically suggested growing adoption from a monetary asset standpoint.
Whilst several other on-chain activity metrics are cooling off, this one suggests a return back towards a dominance of BTC monetary transfers.
Live Advanced Chart
From this exchange related activity, we can develop an NVT Price model. originally developed by Will Woo. This model seeks to imply a 'fair value' for a given amount of on-chain volume settlement.
On a short-term 28-day basis, this model implies a 'fair value' of $35.9k, which is above spot prices for the first time since November 2022. The slower 90-day model is also turning sharply higher, and playing catch up from a level of $24.7k.

Firm Foundations
Thus far, we have established that the recovery of the Bitcoin market in 2023 has been remarkably robust, both from a price performance, but also from a network utilisation standpoint. The chart below helps put this into perspective, demonstrating the firm foundation of supply that was acquired at prices below $30k.
We can see that the supply cluster between $15k and $30k is quite significant, demonstrating that a large volume of coin changed hands over the last 12 months. Conversely, just 25% of the supply was acquired at prices above $30k, held by buyers from the 2021-22 cycle.
Live Advanced Chart
We can bring the Long and Short-Term heuristic into our URPD chart, making the following observations:
üîµ A sizeable volume of LTH supply was acquired between $15k and $25k (thus in profit), and remains unspent, despite prices reaching $31k.
üîµ Almost all coins with an acquisition price above $30k are held by LTHs. These investors are the survivors of the 2021-22 bear, and are either battle hardened HODLers, or likely to create resistance should the market rally higher.
üî¥ The price range between $20k and $30k has seen expanding accumulation since February, despite the onslaught of regulatory pressure in the US.
Overall, this supply distribution is quite 'bottom heavy' suggesting a relatively firm 'foundation' of investor holdings exists below $30k.
Available in the Glassnode Engine Room
We can also see the magnitude of supply acquired during the recent correction to $25k in the chart below. The volume of supply which jumped from 'in-loss' to 'in-profit' status was around 2.47M BTC, equivalent to 12.7% of the total supply.
Conversely, the supply held 'in-loss' has declined to just 4.79M BTC, reaching similar levels seen in July 2021 ($30k), July 2020 ($9.2k), April 2016 ($6.5k), and March 2016 ($425).
Live Advanced Chart
Stuck In the Middle
Bitcoin data often displays strangely repetitive patterns cycle after cycle. In the 2021-22 cycle, the $30k price level formed somewhat of a 'mid-point', and was tested several times both from above and below.
A very similar level was observed in 2013-16 around the $425 level, and again in 2018-19 at approximately $6.5k. Note also that these levels were mentioned above, as points where a similar volume of supply was held 'in-loss'.
Live Advanced Chart
With the market consolidating below this $30k 'mid-point', we can see that around 75% of the total supply is in-profit, and 25% is held in-loss. This is, strangely, the same balance reached as price reached the mid-points in both 2016 and 2019.
In fact, this 75:25 balance of supply held in profit:loss is the equilibrium point for Bitcoin. 50% of all trading days have seen a higher Profit-to-Loss balance, and 50% a lower one.
Live Advanced Chart
This equilibrium point has historically taken time for the market to digest, and re-consolidate around. Many Bitcoin analysts refer to this as the 're-accumulation period', which tends to straddle the halving event.
We can visualize this by looking at proportion of the Market cap held at an Unrealized Loss. During the primary bear, the market is plunged deep into the red, with investors gradually capitulating out. As the market forms and then rallies off the lows, profitability sees a sharp recovery, reaching levels similar to where we are today.
Previous 're-accumulation periods' are characterised by a lack of macro market direction, tending to trade sideways (and volatile) for several months. With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similar lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it.
Live Advanced Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin is currently consolidating below the 2021-22 cycle mid-point of $30k, with several metrics reaching a level of equilibrium and balance. This is synonymous with the 're-accumulation period' seen in past cycles, characterised as several months with little macro direction.
Price performance YTD has however been relatively strong, with a maximum drawdown of just -18% so far. On-chain activity for Bitcoin is cooling down somewhat, driven most by a decline in Inscription activity. Monetary transfer volumes however are starting to pick up, displaying positive momentum often associated with growing liquidity and adoption."

Despite BTC setting a temporary yearly price high of $31.7k, the market remains extremely quiet, with the Bollinger Bands now separated by a price range of just 4.2%.
The realized cap is hovering just below $400B, experiencing a steady but slow inflow of capital into digital assets, led primarily by the major two assets BTC and ETH.
The market is firmly within a regime of profit dominance, however the magnitude of USD value locked in remains near cycle lows, and investors remain unwilling to part with their held supply.
Several metrics now resemble the choppy market conditions seen in the 2016 and 2019-20 periods.
Slow and Steady Inflows
The digital asset market continues to see remarkably little volatility, with the classic 20-day Bollinger Bands experiencing an extreme squeeze. Despite setting a temporary yearly high of $31.7k this week, the rally failed to sustain momentum, bringing BTC prices back into the sideways trading range above $30.0k.
A price range of just 4.2% separates the upper and lower Bollinger bands, making this is the quietest BTC market since the lull in early January.

Beneath the surface, capital is still flowing into digital assets at a steady and modest rate. The Realized Cap is one of the oldest and most widely observed on-chain metrics, and provides a powerful tool for assessing the true capital flows into Bitcoin. It is best thought of as the ‚Äòon-chain Market Cap‚Äô, and reflects the cumulative sum of all realized profit and loss events through history.
The Realized Cap currently sits just shy of $400B and has indicates that a steady stream of capital is entering the asset throughout 2023. As the realized cap climbs, it signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net, suggesting a modest uptick in new demand inflow this year.
Live Advanced Chart
During bear markets, Bitcoin usually experiences significant capital outflows, as investors lock in losses. The realized cap drawdown in 2022 reached the second deepest value of -18.8%, demonstrating the magnitude of the bear market. Recovery of the realized cap ATH in prior cycles have taken between 95 and 239-days, with the recovery so far occurring at a similar rate.
Live Advanced Workbench
Shifts in demand liquidity can also be assessed via the Net Realized Profit / Loss (NRPL) metric, which is the first derivative of the Realized Cap.
NRPL has traded within a profit dominated regime through much of 2023, seeing around $270M/day in net inflows (profits minus losses). This reflects the first sustained profit regime since April 2022. This is similar in scale to both the first half of 2019, and also late 2020, which is a comparison which this report will show from several angles.
Of note is how significantly smaller this regime is compared the 2021 bull market which reached extraordinary peaks of over $3.68B/day.
Live Advanced Chart
If we take a ratio between total realized profit and loss, we can see that 2023 has been an explosive and positive year thus far, breaking firmly above the breakeven level of 1.0 in early January.
However, we can also note that a lower high in this ratio was set this week. If sustained, it may allude to similar choppy market conditions seen in both 2019-20, and again in the second half of 2021. Lower peaks in this metric generally suggest a marginal softening of capital inflows, which in the past has preceded a longer period of time to digest the recovery.
Live Advanced Chart
We can also gauge shifts across the wider digital asset market by comparing the Bitcoin and Etheruem Realized Caps, with the supply of the top stablecoins. By this measure we can see that most capital flows have come in via the two majors BTC and ETH, both seeing inflows of +$21.9B and $18.0B YTD, respectively.
Stablecoins however have seen a net reduction of -$10.4B in aggregate supply, led largely by USDC and BUSD redemptions. This trend is now firmly in place, suggesting a notable market preference for the big two digital assets over stablecoin capital.

The Incentive to Spend
SOPR is another powerful tool, useful for for tracking the magnitude of profit and loss taking events across the market. Here, we define a framework consisting of two binary regimes to characterise market behaviour:
Loss Dominant Regime:
Successive prints below 1.0 are indicative of investors locking in losses, and returns to the breakeven level are often utilized as exit point (forming resistance).
Profit Dominant Regime:
Successive SOPR prints above 1.0 indicates a return of profit taking, and returns to the breakeven level are often considered a near term point of value (forming support).
SOPR currently resides within a profit dominant regime, recording a value of 1.06, indicating the average coin changing hands is locking in a 6% profit. This again has similar characteristics to the 2016 and 2019 periods.
Live Professional Chart
With this in mind, the breakdown of exchange inflow volumes suggest that Short-Term Holders (STH) are the primary entities that are active in the market. Out of the total 39.6k BTC in daily exchange inflows, 78% of this is associated with the STH cohort, being those investors that have been active since early February.

Live Professional Workbench
This makes sense when we contextualize the proportion of STH supply that is held in profit, which is now just over 88% of their total balance. This is above the mean plus one standard deviation level, and is historically associated with macro uptrends where the incentive to take profits is high.
As prices rise, the STH cohort are becoming increasingly likely to spend and take profits.
Live
Professional
Workbench
If we compare this to the Long-Term Holder cohort (LTHs), we can see their position is comparatively less extreme, with just over 73% of their balance held in profit. This indicates that around a quarter of all LTH supply was acquired at prices above than $30k and within the 2021-22 cycle (as covered in last weeks edition
WoC 28
).
Live Professional Workbench
If we breakdown the realized value locked in by the market, we can see the strength of the 2023 recovery thus far. Both LTHs and STHs are now seeing the super-majority (73%) of their spending locking in a profit.
This is a significant improvement over the extreme pain experienced after FTX failed, where 90% of all spent coins were locking in losses (the deepest capitulation in history by this measure).
Live Professional Chart
However, if we view this from the lens of total USD denominated realized value (profit plus loss), it remains near cycle lows of just $290M/day. Whilst this is a significant sum on a nominal basis, it is again comparable to the 2019 peak, and to October 2020 where BTC prices were 50% lower than they currently are.
As such, it suggests that even though the Bitcoin market cap is ~2x larger today, investors who are holding large profits or losses are extremely unwilling to spend their coins on-chain.
Live Professional Workbench
Overall, this suggests that the vast majority of Bitcoin holders are sitting tight, and are opting not to revalue their holdings. This speaks to our prior report (
WoC 26
) where the proportion of liquid, mobile and active BTC available on the market remains remarkably small.
Seeing the Light
To close this edition, we will call back to our report from just over a year ago titled
The Darkest Phase of the Bear
(
WoC 24-2022
, June 2022). In this report, we introduced a metric which helps identify large scale shifts in LTH and STH behavior.
It is uncommon for the LTH cohort to spend coins that have a higher average cost basis (lower profit multiple) than the STH cohort. However, such events do occur, and are historically associated with deep bear market capitulation events. These are periods where even the strongest hands are purged from the market, in particular those that acquired coins near the cycle top and then weathered the full duration of the downtrend.
With the strong price performance YTD, and the dominance of STH spending this week, this SOPR ratio has commenced its second leg down. This provides a macro scale view on a reversal in investor behavior. There has only been one instance in March 2020 where an 'echo bounce' occurred in this metric, pushing back above 1.0 before spending a multi-year period below it.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Despite setting a temporarily new yearly high of $31.7k this week, BTC prices continue to trade within a very tight trading range. This has resulted in an extreme tightening of the Bollinger Bands, separated by just 4.2%. This compression in volatility is matched by cyclical lows in realized profit and loss being locked in by the market.
The Short-Term Holder cohort dominates the inflows into exchanges at present, incentivised by over 88% of supply now being in profit. However on the broader scale, investors appear remarkably unwilling to let go of their supply. In many ways, this resembles periods like 2016 and 2019-20, characterised by choppy market conditions."

Through observations of the balance change of various on-chain entities, we isolate whales (1k+ BTC) as one of the primary cohorts interacting with exchanges in recent weeks.
The dominance of whale inflow volumes to exchanges is significant, accounting for 41% of the total. Of this, over 82% of whale inflows are destined for Binance, the largest exchange in the industry.
We can also identify that many of these active whale entities are classified as Short-Term Holders, with notable activity around local market peaks/troughs.

Whale inflows to exchanges is historically large, with 255k BTC flowing from whales to exchanges.
Internally, whale sub-cohorts are seeing balances shift in size by between -49k to +33.8k BTC.
In aggregate, the whale group has seen just -8.7k BTC in net outflows.
Since the aggregate balance change is relatively flat, yet there are significant changes taking place both internally and via exchange flows, it is highly possible that these whale entities are moving funds internally. We will refer to this as ‚ÄòWhale Reshuffling.‚Äô
Live Professional Workbench
To test this Whale Reshuffling hypothesis, we can investigate the 30-day position change for whale subdivisions (>10K BTC üü• and 1k-10k BTC üü¶). Our goal is to find periods where one group sees a balance increase, whilst the other sees a similar scale decrease.
In the chart below, we have highlighted the periods where a strong inverse correlation of -0.55 or less üü© can be identified. We can see that such an interval coincided with the recent market surge toward the $30k range.
Thus suggests that whales have indeed exhibited a relatively neutral balance change of late, with much of their recent activity being reshuffling via exchanges.
Live Professional Workbench
Whales and Exchanges
With this whale behavior in mind, we can now try to observe any impacts on the market, with a focus on exchanges. The next chart can be used to analyse the relationship between whale entities and exchanges via two traces:
üü™ BTC-denominated exchange inflows attributed to whales
üîµ Percent of all inflows attributed to whales.
During the recent rally, whale inflow volumes to exchanges picked up quite significantly, hitting +16.3k BTC/day. This is a whale dominance of 41% of all exchange inflows, which is comparable to both the LUNA crash (39%) and the failure of FTX (33%).
Live Professional Workbench
Analysis of the Whale Netflow to Exchanges can be used as a proxy for their influence on the supply and demand balance. Whale-to-exchange netflows have tended to oscillate between ¬±5k BTC/day over the last five years.
However, throughout June and July this year, whale inflows have sustained an elevated inflow bias of between 4.0k to 6.5k BTC/day.
Live Professional Workbench
We will return to a simple correlation tool to identify periods where whales dominate the global exchange netflow to exchanges. The chart below shows periods with a high correlation (0.75 or more) between Whale netflows and global exchange netflows üü• (suggesting whale dominance), with three key periods visible:
The 2017 bull into the 2018 bear market (market transition and maturation).
The post-March 2020 period (institutional adoption and expansion of GBTC).
Late 2021 into 2022 (the unfortunate malfeasance of the FTX/Alameda entity).
From this view, we can again see that Whale behavior (strong inflow bias) is quite divergent from the rest of the market (modest outflow bias).
Live Professional Workbench
Arguably the most interesting component of this story is the destination of whale coins. If we break down whale inflow volumes, we can see that around 82% of whale-to-exchange flows are heading into Binance üü®, while Coinbase üü¶ accounts for 6.8%, and all other exchanges account for 11.2%.
This implies that almost 34% of whale inflows during the July rally were sent into Binance, with an extraordinary uptick in Binance dominance visible over the last 12 months. This also speaks to some of the regional divergences we observed in prior weeks (
WoC 26
).
Live Professional Workbench
Short-Term Whales
Having established that whale entities are dominating exchange activity at present, we can connect these observations to last week's report, where we noted that most exchange activity was linked to Short-Term Holders (
WoC 29
).
Short-Term Holder Dominance across Exchange Inflows has exploded to 82%, which is now drastically above the long-term range over the last five years (typically 55% to 65%). From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market (and thus classified as STHs).
Live Professional Workbench
If we look at the degree of Profit/Loss realized by Short-Term Holder volume flowing into exchanges, it becomes evident that these newer investors are trading local market conditions. Each rally and correction since the FTX fallout has seen a 10k+ BTC uptick in STH profit or loss, respectively.
Live Professional Workbench
We can see this behavior even clearer by looking at the net profit/loss bias for coins sent to exchanges by the STH cohort. Here, we can see local market extremes see STHs locking in a high degree of profit üü•, or loss üü©, indicated by this metric trading above or below ¬±0.3, respectively.
Live Professional Workbench
Short-Term Holder SOPR üü† is another powerful tool to provide confluence for this local trading behavior in spot markets. SOPR tracks the ratio between the average spending price (disposal) and the acquisition price for Short-Term Holders' coins.
The following chart employs one standard deviation bands (90-day) to periods where excess profit or loss is realized. We can see several instances where these pricing bands were breached around 2023 local market extremes.
Live Professional Chart
Finally, we can combine these observations using Workbench to develop a tool which highlights when both of these conditions are met:
STH SOPR is trading above the mean + 1sd band (90-day).
Relative net STH profit/loss bias to exchanges exceeds 0.3.
This tool can help to identify when the STH cohort is locking in a large degree of profit relative to recent history. There have been several such events throughout 2023, with many establishing local market peaks.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Whale entities for Bitcoin are often cited as being a key influence on market price action. Whilst it is quite challenging to track and monitor these entities, they appear to be increasingly active in recent months. In particular, 42% of exchange inflows are related to whale entities, with a super-majority of these destined for Binance.
We can also deduce that most of the active whale entities are classified as Short-Term Holders. By combining these observations, we can develop a suite of tools to track periods of strong profit and loss realization by this cohort. From this, we can develop a set of tools to help navigate local market extremes using on-chain data."

Several positive developments in the digital asset industry, as well as developments within the DeFi sector has spurred renewed interest from investors in DeFi tokens.
The uptick in DeFi token interest has sparked the interest of market makers, who have increased liquidity in the respective pools, indicating a positive outlook for trading and price activities around these token.
Further analysis of Uniswap's trading volume distribution reveals that a significant portion of trading activity can be attributed to bots, which primarily focus on ETH-Stablecoin pairs.
Altcoins Back in Favour?
During the past few months, altcoin markets have seen a tug-of-war between positive and negative news events, driven by several key developments:
In early June, the SEC labelled 68 cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities, putting a damper on market interest in altcoins outside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many of these tokens had seen poor performance even prior to this news, which we covered in our report
'Dealing With The DeFi Downtrend'
.
The Bitcoin spot ETF filings by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity resulted in an uptick in market sentiment, spilling over beyond Bitcoin and into the wider digital asset space.
Moreover, the verdict of the Ripple Labs vs. SEC case in mid-July, which ruled that the crypto company did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges, sent a positive signal for other US-based crypto projects and the industry in general. The XRP victory provided a degree of hope for altcoin investors regarding robustness against further regulatory action.
In particular, tokens related to the DeFi sector have seen the strongest performance, with our DeFi index price rallying 56% since the low set on 11-June. Other key market sectors such as GameFi and Staking have under-performed by comparison.
Live Workbench Chart
Our DeFi index consists of the top 8 DeFi tokens by market cap, and has established an almost two-month-long uptrend relative to ETH. This is the first outperformance since September 2022, and with very similar performance thus far.
Live Chart
However, if we look at the top eight DeFi tokens separately, two tokens stand out as primary drivers of this trend: MKR and COMP. Upon closer examination, we can seet that the performance may well be closely related to new project fundamentals, rather than wider market developments.
On June 28th, Compound's founder and CEO, Robert Leshner, announced his departure from the lending protocol as well as the launch of a new project that focuses on bringing regulated finance to blockchain networks. Following this announcement, the COMP token surged by up to 83% in one week.
Today, I'm excited to announce the founding of a new company,
@superstatefunds
Superstate's mission is to create regulated financial products that bridge traditional markets & blockchain ecosystems.
‚Äî Robert Leshner (@rleshner)
June 28, 2023
Around the same time, MakerDAO activated its
Smart Burn Engine
, a buyback program which uses excess DAI owned by the protocol to purchase MKR from a Uniswap pool. The prospect of removing approximately $7 million worth of MKR in one month caused the token's price to increase by up to 43% on the week.
Live Workbench Chart
By examining the DEX vs. CEX exchange flows for the top eight DeFi tokens, we can see a renewed interest in DEX activity. The relative share of volume traded on DEXs has increased from 3.75% at the beginning of June to 29.2% today, close to the highs seen during the second half of 2022.
Mixed Types of Uniswap Trading
With this uptick in DEX activity, we can investigate how these recent developments have impacted DEX activity and any potential implications for stakeholders. Our primary focus will be on Uniswap, the leading DEX, which has also been the most significant consumer of gas in the past week.
In terms of Uniswap trading volume on Ethereum, the current level of $5.57B/week remains significantly lower than in previous years. There was a volume surge related to interest around Liquid Staking Tokens earlier in 2023, as well as a brief uptick in 'meme-token' which has since faded out.
From this lens, we can see that the recent excitement around the BTC ETF filings and the Ripple vs. SEC verdict has not sparked an appreciable increase in trading activity on Uniswap.
By examining the distribution of Uniswap trade volume across different Layer 2s, we get a clearer picture. It becomes apparent that an appreciable portion of trading has shifted from the Ethereum mainnet across to Arbitrum, attracting up to 32% of volume in March. This trend has remained elevated in June and July, which provides a degree of reasoning for the lower volume on Ethereum we observed above.
Bots vs. Humans
Another way to contextualize Uniswap trading activity is to look at the type of trader executing it. Since 2019, we have seen the emergence of various types of MEV bots, which are automated programs that monitor the blockchain to detect lucrative trades to exploit. For the purposes of this analysis, we will focus only on two types; Arbitrage and Sandwich bots.
Arbitrage bots
aim to profit from price differences between the same token-pair across various DEXs and CEXs.
Sandwich bots
work by inserting their trades in front of the target trader (assume a buyer) which causes an execution at a wider spread. After this, the sandwich bot will sell the asset again to close the spread, maximising value on both sides.
The chart below displays the proportion of volume on Uniswap (on Ethereum) that comes from bot trading versus human trading.
We observe that Sandwich bots generally account for more than 60% of daily volume. The volume share of Arbitrage bots has decreased from roughly 20% to 10% since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the share of volume created by human traders has increased up to 30% since the beginning of July, aligning with the period of increased interest in DeFi tokens.
Please note that this clustering is the product of a the first iteration of newly developed heuristics at Glassnode, which are still under active development. For this iteration, we have created rather conservative criteria for labelling bots, especially in regards to Arbitrage bots.
Furthermore take note that different types of bots create different amounts of transactions and volume. For example, a sandwich bot executes at least two trades, creating twice as much trading volume in one trading action as a human trader.
Since the volume can be inflated differently by different type of bot attacks, the daily number of trades by trader types provides a another view into the comparison.
We can see that human traders were very active during major events such as the USDC depeg or the meme-token mania. With greater price volatility and an influx of 'target traders', both Arbitrage and Sandwich bots follow suit, becoming up to three times as active during these upticks in human trading.
The interactive chart below displays the preferred token and pool for each type of trader, with all three trader types clearly prefer the largest and most liquid trading pairs ETH-USDC and ETH-USDT.
Liquidity Pools as Information Markets
Since the introduction of Uniswap V3, liquidity providers could distribute liquidity within specific price ranges within the pool. Rather than spreading liquidity across an infinite price range, liquidity could be more efficiently concentrated around price ranges where the investor expects the highest trade volumes (to capture fees).
Source: Uniswap
Since the announcement of the Maker buyback program, the most successful liquidity pool for Maker on Uniswap V3 was the MKR/WETH pool, which has experienced a noteworthy increase in liquidity.
Whilst the pool has traditionally held mostly MKR funds, the liquidity depth of WETH has risen by over 700%. This suggests that liquidity providers are signalling an expectation of higher trade volumes for the MKR-WETH pair.
Upon examining the composition of the pool, we can clearly see an increase in the share of WETH, which now accounts for 21.2% of the total. This is the result of traders increasingly purchasing MKR with WETH, indicating a clear rise in demand for MKR since the start of June.
As a final note, we propose an idea on how the liquidity pools of Uniswap could function as a form of information market for the expected price development of tokens. If we take a closer look at MKR-WETH liquidity which is placed out of range, we can clearly see that liquidity is elevated at price ticks much higher than the MKR/ETH exchange rate.
As liquidity providers move their capital up to higher price ranges, they are in a way expressing a form of out-of-the-money option on fee revenue at higher price points. Under the assumption liquidity providers are rational profit-seeking actors, the movement of their liquidity may provide option-market like insight into the expected volatility and expected range for the token of interest.
Summary and Conclusions
The regulatory environment surrounding digital assets has been back-and-forth in 2023, with a varied split of positive and negative news. Over recent weeks, DeFi tokens in particular have experienced out-performance, led by MKR and COMP. However after examining trading activities on Uniswap, it appears that these price increase have not been reflected in an uptick in DEX trading activities.
An explanation for this is both a growing share of trade volume occurring on L2s like Arbitrum, but also by a lighter presence of human traders. With fewer human trades, there is an equally light degree of arbitrage and sandwich bot activity.
In the case of MKR, there has been a notable uptick in market makers providing liquidity in Uniswap pools, signaling a degree of anticipation for increased trade volumes. From this, we propose a concept whereby the distribution of liquidity may well provide information into the expected trade ranges for the token in question."

Bitcoin prices are infamously volatile, however the market is currently experiencing an extreme volatility compression. Fewer than 5% of trading days have a tighter trade range.
Futures markets are notably flat, with trade volumes for BTC and ETH both probing all-time-lows, and cash-and-carry yields of 5.3% just slightly above the risk free rate.
Implied volatility in options markets is undergoing a significant volatility crush, with volatility premiums trading at less than half the 2021-22 baseline.
Both the put/call ratio, and the 25-delta skew metrics are at all-time-lows, suggesting options markets favour calls, and put options have priced in very light volatility ahead.

A Quiet Patch
Bitcoin markets are experiencing an incredibly quiet patch, with several measures of volatility collapsing towards all-time lows. In this edition, we will explore just how remarkable this quiet period is from a historical standpoint, and then explore how this is being priced into derivatives markets.
To set the scene, we note that the BTC spot price is trading above a number of long-term moving averages (111D, 200D, 365D and 200W) which are widely observed across the industry. These averages range from a low of $23.3k (200DMA) up to $28.5k (111DMA). This chart also highlights similar periods over the past two cycles which tend to align with macro uptrends.
Live Chart
We can see a very similar context using on-chain realized prices which model the cost basis for three cohorts:
üü† Entire market (the realized price).
üî¥ Short-Term Holders (coins younger than 155-day).
üîµ Long-Term Holders (coins older than 155-day).
The spot price is again trading above all three models and demonstrates a strong confluence with the classic technical analysis tools above.
Live Chart
It has been 842-days since the bull market peak was set in April 2021 (see note below). The 2023 recovery is actually faring somewhat better than the last two cycles, trading -54% below the ATH, compared with -64% historically.
We also note that both the 2015-16 and 2019-20 cycles experienced a 6-month period of sideways boredom before the market accelerated above the -54% drawdown level. This is perhaps an indication of the boredom which may lie ahead.
Note: we proposed the idea that the
May 2021 sell-off
was in fact the start of bear market sentiment from observing bearish divergences in
WoC 4-22
and
WoC 8-22
.
Live Chart
After a blazing hot start to 2023, both the quarterly and monthly price performance has cooled off. We can again see many similarities to prior cycles where the initial rally off the bottom is powerful, but leads into an extended period of choppy consolidation.
This period is often referred to as the
re-accumulation period
by Bitcoin analysts.
Live Chart
Volatility Collapses
Bitcoin realized volatility ranging from 1-month to 1-year observation windows has fallen dramatically in 2023, reaching multi-year lows. The 1y volatility window is now at levels not seen since December 2016. This is the fourth such period of extreme volatility compression:
The late stage 2015 bear into the 2016 re-accumulation period.
The late stage 2018 bear which preceded a 50% sell-off in Nov. This was however followed by the Apr 2019 recovery rally, rising from $4k to $14k over three months.
Post March 2020 consolidation as the world adjusted to the outbreak of COVID-19.
The 2022 end of year break as the market digested the FTX failure, and our current market (see
WoC 2-23
for our analysis in January 2023).
Live Chart
The price range which separates the 7-day high and low is just 3.6%. Just 4.8% of all trading days have ever experienced a tighter weekly trade range.
Live Chart
The 30-day price range is even more extreme, constricting price to just a 9.8% band over the last month, and with only 2.8% of all months being tighter.
Periods of consolidation and price compression at this magnitude are extremely rare events for Bitcoin.

Futures Flatten Out
This quiet spell is also visible across derivatives markets for both BTC and ETH. The combined Futures and Options trade volume for the two assets are at, or approaching all-time-lows for Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.
BTC is currently seeing $19.0B in aggregate derivatives trade volume, whilst ETH markets have just $9.2B/day, taking out the Jan-2023 lows.
Live Chart
The market is also maintaining a relatively risk off stance, with Bitcoin dominance within futures markets grinding slowly higher. Throughout 2021-22, Ethereum futures markets experienced a steady increase in both trade volume and open interest relative to Bitcoin, peaking at a 60 BTC : 40 ETH split in H2-2022.
This year has seen the scales tilt back in favour of Bitcoin, suggesting lighter liquidity and a reduced risk appetite remains a force moving capital up the risk curve.

The
Perpetual Futures dashboard
covers several metrics comparing futures leverage, volumes, and liquidations for BTC and ETH.
Live Chart
Open interest Bitcoin in futures markets has also been relatively flat at $12.1B over the last month. These are similar levels to the second half of 2022 when prices were ~30% cheaper than today and the FTX exchange was still active. It is also similar to during the Jan-2021 run-up when prices were 30% higher, the market was less mature, and leveraged speculation was only just heating up.
Live Chart
On a comparative basis, Options markets have seen a significant uptick in dominance and growth, with open interest more than doubling over the last 12-months. Options now rival futures markets in terms of open interest magnitude.
Futures open interest on the other hand has been in steady decline since late 2022 (when FTX collapsed), and has only seen a slightly increase in 2023.
Live Chart
Implied Volatility Crush
With so little trade volume and lacklustre activity in futures markets, the next goal is to identify which opportunities are keeping traders active in the digital asset derivatives space.
In futures markets, the term structure indicates that an annualized yield of between 5.8% and 6.6% is available via a cash-and-carry strategy. This however is only a very slight premium over yields available in short-term US Treasury Bills, or money market funds.
Live Chart
Perpetual swap markets are by far the most liquid trading venue for digital assets, and traders and market makers can lock in a funding rate premium to arbitrage the futures and spot prices. This form of cash-and-carry is more volatile and dynamic, but currently yields a more attractive 8.13% annualized to account for this additional risk.
Of note is the sustained positive uptick in funding rates since January, signalling a marked change in sentiment since late 2022.
Live Chart
Moving across to options markets, and we can see just how severe the volatility crush has been, with implied volatility across all contract expirations collapsing to all-time lows.
Bitcoin markets are infamously volatile, with options trading at an implied volatility between 60% to over 100% for the majority of 2021-22. However at present, options are pricing in the smallest volatility premium in history, with IV between 24% and 52%, less than half of the long-term baseline.
üìä
Related Dashboard:
All options metrics available on Glassnode are available in our dashboard for
Bitcoin
and

markets.
Live Chart
The IV term structure shows that over the last two weeks, volatility premiums are contracting. The December contract has seen implied volatility fall from 46% to 39% over the last two weeks alone. Options with an expiration out to June 2024 carry a volatility premium of just over 50%, which is historically low.
Live Chart
The Put/Call Ratio across both volume and open interest metrics are at, or near all-time lows, trading between 0.42 and 0.48. This suggests that there is a net bullish sentiment within in the market, and demand for call options continues to dominate.
Live Chart
As a result, put options are increasingly cheap relative to calls, reflected by an all-time-low in the 25-delta skew metric. Overall, this indicates that options markets, which now rival futures markets in size, are pricing in historically low volatility on the road ahead.
However, given fewer than 5% of all trading days have seen a similar price range contraction, this suggests Bitcoin is either no longer infamously volatile...or volatility could be mispriced.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Few news headlines proclaim Bitcoin to be a price-stable and non-volatile asset, which makes monthly trade ranges of less than 10% stand out like a sore thumb. The market is arguably the least volatile it has ever been, calling into question whether heightened volatility is indeed ahead.
Futures cash-and-carry yields range between 5.3% and 8.1% which are marginally above the risk free rate of short-dated US T-bills. Options markets have priced in the lowest implied volatility premium in history, with put options in particular seeing the lightest demand.
Given the context of Bitcoin's infamous volatility, is a new era of BTC price stability upon us, or is volatility mispriced?"

The digital asset market continues trading within a historically low volatility regime, with several metrics indicating extreme apathy and exhaustion has been reached in the $29k to $30k range.
There are some indicators that the market is slightly ‚Äòtop-heavy‚Äô as indicated by the concentration of Short-Term Holder supply and cost basis around the current spot price.
We explore several new iterations of SOPR by age band as a tool to monitor profit taking behavior by various cross sections of the market.

The Week On-chain Dashboard
contains all charts covered in this edition.
Modest Capital Inflows
The Realized Cap is one of the most important metrics in the on-chain analysis toolbox, representing the cumulative capital inflow since inception. Both the magnitude and gradient of the Realized Cap are informative, suggesting over $16B in value (+4.1%) has flowed into Bitcoin YTD.
However, we can also see the climb is quite shallow, a far cry from the steep rise seen during the 2021-22 uptrend. This indicates that whilst capital is flowing in, it is doing so at a very modest pace.
Live Advanced Chart
We can decompose the Realized Cap into the Long-Term and Short-Term Holder components. The wealth held by the STH cohort has experienced an increase of +$22B this year, whilst the LTH cohort has seen an approximately equal reduction of -$21B.
This reflects two mechanics:
Short-Term Holders chasing the market higher, creating an elevated average cost basis.
Supply acquired at prices below $24k in Q1 maturing into LTH status, resulting in a declining average cost basis.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can see this within the cost basis estimates for each cohort. The STH cost basis is up +59% YTD, currently trading at $28.6k. The LTH cost basis is trading much lower at around $20.3k.
The separation between these two cost basis is an indicator that many recent buyers have a relatively elevated acquisition price.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can confirm this using the URPD distribution split into these two cohorts. Note how a large cluster of STH coins üî¥ are located between $25k and $31k. On a macro scale, this supply distribution does resembles similar periods during bear market recoveries in the past. However, on a shorter timeframe, it could be argued to be a slightly top heavy market, with many price sensitive investors at risk of falling into an unrealized loss.
Live in the Glassnode Engine Room
We note that the the supply held by Long-Term Holders continues to increase, hitting an ATH of 14.6M BTC. In direct contrast, Short-Term Holder supply has declined to multi-year low of 2.56M BTC.
Overall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings.
Live Advanced Workbench
Apathy, Exhaustion and a Lack of Volatility
As we covered in last weeks edition (
WoC 32
), price volatility for BTC has collapsed to historical lows. The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%, with a tighter spread only seen on two occassions in history:
Sept 2016
- Price was $604 and was early in the 2016-17 run-up.
Jan 2023
- Price was $16.8k and traded within a $52 range to start the year (
WoC 2
).
Live Advanced Workbench
Another lens to observe this volatility compression (investor exhaustion) is via the spending behavior of investors. Here we use Realized Value as a measure under the following framework:
High volatility motivates investors to spend coins
that were acquired at a cost basis much higher (in loss) or lower (in profit) than the spot exchange rate.
Low volatility (and investor exhaustion)
results in most coins moved on-chain having a cost basis very close to the spot rate (and thus realized very small profit/loss).
An ideal tool to monitor this is the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which compares the absolute value of realized profit ¬†loss (the change in asset valuation) to the realized cap (asset valuation). For STHs, we can see this metric is effectively at all-time lows, with fewer than 27 trading days (0.57%) recording a lower value.
This indicates that all investors who sought to take profit or loss at this price range have now done so, and the market must make a move to motivate new spending (i.e. an indicator for impending volatility).
Live Professional Workbench
The Short-Term Holder Profit / Loss ratio shows that profit taking remains dominant for this cohort, however it has cooled off back towards neutral in recent weeks. If sufficient new demand flows in, this ratio should remain above 1. However if losses start to accellerate (P/L Ratio falls below 1), it may indicate that stress within the ‚Äòtop heavy market‚Äô is starting to play out.

If we turn to the LTH cohort, we can also see they‚Äôre also within a profit driven regime, having only just recovered from the severe losses throughout the 2022 bear market. The LTH Profit/Loss Ratio remains small in magnitude, and a far cry from prior bull market conditions.
Only 472 / 4963 (9.5%) of all profitable trading days have recorded a lower value, highlighting the infancy of this uptrend.
Live Professional Workbench
The Long-Term Sell-Side Risk Ratio is also pushing towards all-time-lows, with only 44 trading days (1.1%) recording a lower value. Overall, this suggests that volatility and price expansion (in either direction) is likely required to break this spell of investor apathy and exhaustion.

The Temperature of Supply
Analysis of the Bitcoin supply and demand balance often utilises the dimension of ‚Äòinvestor holding time‚Äô, accounting for the time since a coin last moved on-chain. Often we can relate these age bands to investor conviction as is the case with the Long/Short-Term heuristic at 155-days (
research here
).
We can also consider the supply under a slightly different framework to identify market shifts:
üî¥
Hot Supply (< 1w)
is the most active and liquid portion which has transacted within the last 7-days.
üü†
Warm Supply (1w-6m)
comprises the less active component of Short-Term Holder supply, right through to the start of the Long-Term Holder cohort.
üîµ
Single-Cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-3y)
being the supply which transacted within the last three years, and is therefore reasonably likely to respond to macro market trends (see our
report detailing this cohort here
).
Hot Supply (< 1-week)
Starting with the most active and liquid of coins, we can see that Hot Supply currently accounts for just 2.8% of all invested value held in BTC. This is in line with the extremely ‚Äòilliquid‚Äô hangover periods seen after all late stage bear markets. It describes a market where only the HODLer cohort remain, and trade volumes tend to be extremely low.
Live Advanced
Chart
We recently rolled out Workbench support for the Realized Cap HODL Waves (and similar multi-line style charts). We can use this tool to calculate the cost basis for hot supply and compare it to that of the parent Short-Term Holder cohort. From this we can identify two interesting pieces of market structure:
The STH cost basis tends to provide support in uptrends as investors acquire near their break-even point during corrections.
Large deviations between the Hot Supply cost basis and the STH cost basis often align with local market peaks.
This latter point is a result of speculators chasing the price into local peaks, driving up the Hot Supply cost basis, but increasing the volume of supply at risk of a drawdown. This can create a near-term pause in the rally until sufficient demand returns during the correction.
Live Advanced Workbench
If we look to the SOPR family for Hot Supply, we can see this playing out in their profit taking behavior:
üî¥
< 24h coins
tend to be spent close to their break-even price.
üîµ
1d-1w coins
take profits (SOPR > 1) during rallies and local market highs.
üü¢
1w-1m coins
see a similar profitable peak, although at a larger amplitude due to the longer holding time (and thus larger price delta since acquisition).
This early work on SOPR variants by age bands provides an interesting insight into the supply and demand structure playing out day-to-day.
Warm Supply
Moving onto the Warm Supply group (1w-6m), we can see a slight uptick YTD, accounting for around 30% of the wealth stored in Bitcoin.
Whilst this value is meaningful in magnitude, it is extremely low in a comparitive context. By proxy, the extremely small proportion of wealth held within both Hot and Warm supply indicates that the most significant holdings are within the more mature Long-Term Holder supply.
Live Advanced Chart
Given Warm Supply accounts for the majority of the age range (and coin volume) within the Short-Term Holder cohort, the average cost basis is very similar to STHs. If we look at it through the lens of the Warm Supply MVRV ratio, we can see it is approaching a retest of its break-even level at $27.6K.
This further supports the Sell-side Risk Ratio observations from the prior section, where volatility is likely brewing.
Live Advanced Workbench
Extended breaks above, or below the Warm Supply cost basis have historically aligned with a macro shift in the market trend, with the average uptrend lasting 227 days, and an average downtrend lasting 132 days.
The 2023 rally has now traded above this model for 212-days so far, hovering slightly above it today.
Live Advanced Workbench
The 2023 market strength was successfully capitalized upon, with profit taking visible across all SOPR constituents within the Warm Supply cohort. The average spent coin is locking in between 4% and 9% profit over the last few months.
Single Cycle Long-Term Holders
The final cohort are the Single Cycle Long-Term Holders. This cohort covers investors that weathered the full spectrum of excitement, chaos, and volatility of the 2020-23 cycle.
HODLing remains the preferred market dynamic for this group, accounting for over 63% of the invested capital. This has reached similar heights as past transitional phases between late stage bear markets, and new macro uptrends.
Live Advanced Chart
The cost basis of these single cycle holders is currently at $33.8k, suggesting that this group is still holding an average unrealized loss of -13.3%. This compares to the average LTH with a cost basis of $20.4k and an unrealized profit of +43.6%.
Since the classic LTH cohort includes long-dormant, lost, and deep HODLed supply, much of which carries tremendous unrealized profit, it is likely that it underestimates the true acquisition price of the average high conviction investor. As such, it suggests that much of the Bitcoin market still remains underwater on their holdings, and that the damage of the 2022 bear market still plays a meaningful role in guiding investor decisions.
Live Advanced Workbench
Finally, we see a very interesting divergence between SOPR variants within this cohort:
üü°
6m-12m SOPR
describes investors acquiring coins between Aug 2022 (post LUNA and 3AC collapsing) and Feb of 2023. This group is currently locking in an average profit of +27%
(cycle low buyers)
.
üü§ 1-2y SOPR
describes investors from Aug 2021 to Aug 2022, whom are still locking in losses over -21% on average
(largely cycle top buyers)
.
üü£ 2y-3y SOPR
is oscillating around break-even, and captures investors from Aug 2020 to Aug 2021 with prices ranging from $10k through to $64k
(the bull market buyers)
.
This demonstrates that a great majority of LTHs are actually transacting at a loss, and only those from the 6m-1y age group are in a meaningful degree of profit.
Summary and Conclusions
Volatility in the digital asset space remains historically low, with investors reaching an all-time-low in willingness to spend coins on-chain. The conditions of the Bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders.
However, with this low volatility comes apathy and exhaustion, which often entails a relatively weak influx of demand. The Realized Cap is climbing, but only very slightly, suggesting a very boring, choppy, sideways market may remain on the road ahead. This is likely compounded by the fact a large majority of the Bitcoin market is still underwater on their holdings, and likely to create resistance throughout the recovery."

The market experienced a violent sell-off last week, sending BTC prices below $25k, and ending a period of historically low volatility.
The market has been slicing through several important price support models, putting the bulls on the back-foot.
A primary driver appears to be a leverage flush-out in derivatives market, seeing over $2.5B worth of open interest cleared in just a few hours.
Options markets have sharply repriced volatility premiums from historical lows, although open interest remains remarkably stable.
Spot markets are still relatively 'top heavy', with over 88.3% of Short-Term Holder supply now held at an unrealized loss.
We introduce a responsive experimental indicator which helps identify inflection points in market profitability and trend.

contains all charts covered in this edition.
Technical Damage
The digital asset market experienced a violent sell-off last week, marking a dramatic end to the exhausting lack of volatility that dominated since July. As we covered in the last two editions (
WoC 32
,
WoC 33
), price action for BTC had reached some of the lowest volatility levels on record, and options markets in particular had heavily discounted the possibility of significant downside volatility.
After several weeks trading just above $29.3k, BTC prices exploded lower, slicing through several long term moving averages, including the 111-day, 200-day, and the 200-week. With the market closing the week at around $26.1k, this represents a significant loss of market support, and the bulls now have their work cut out for them.
Live Chart
The sell-off also pushed prices below the Short-Term Holder cost basis, an on-chain price model which has historically provided support during robust up-trends. With the Realized Price and Long-Term Holder cost basis trading some distance below ($20.3k), this puts the market in a somewhat precarious position from a psychological standpoint.
As we noted last week (
WoC 33
), the supply held by the Short-Term Holder cohort is somewhat 'top heavy', with a significant majority having a cost basis above $29.0k. This is a topic we will revisit later in this edition.
Live Chart
The weekly price action traded down -11.3%, which is a significant fall, but is not the most significant in recent years. This performance is slightly shy of the long-term one standard deviation move of -12.6%, a level which was breached during major capitulation events such as the collapse events of FTX, 3AC, and LUNA.
Live Chart
On a daily basis however, this is the largest single day sell-off year to date, falling -7.2% on the 17-August. This did exceed a one standard deviation move to the downside, catching the bulls off guard.

Options Reprice Volatility
Implied volatility in options markets had reached all-time lows by the start of the week, trading 50% below the long-term baseline seen throughout 2021-22. Of course, as this week's sell-off kicked off, volatility was quickly repriced. Implied volatility more than doubled for short dated contracts with an expiry out to the end of September.
Live Chart
Put options naturally experienced the sharpest repricing, with 25-Delta Skew reversing completely, rallying from historical lows of -10% to over +10%. Overall, options traders were shaken violently awake from their sleep, being forced to reevaluate volatility expectations moving forwards.
Live Chart
Interestingly, open interest for both call and put options remained surprisingly stable, with very little net change given the explosive price action. This suggests that whilst volatility was likely mispriced, there wasn't a great deal of forced deleveraging in options markets.
One development we highlighted in WoC 32 is that the magnitude of open interest in Bitcoin options markets is now comparable to futures markets, meaning analysts should keep a close eye on both.
üìä

Live Chart
Options trade volume did spike higher, increasing by 200%+ to $620M/day for calls, and $326M/day for puts. It remains to be seen if this elevated volatility regime sticks around, or whether the prevailing low liquidity environment reverts back to a low enthusiasm market.
Live Chart
Futures Flush-out
Unlike options markets, futures traders did experience a major deleveraging event which has remarkable similarities to the FTX collapse. Whilst smaller in scale, over $2.5 Billion worth of perpetual futures contracts were closed out in a single day. This represents a -24.5% decline, and a complete unwind of all leverage build up through July-August.
Live Chart
A total of $230M in long positions were liquidated and forced closed in a few hours, making for the largest liquidation event since LUNA collapsed in May 2022. This liquidation event was larger in magnitude than the short squeeze which kicked off the 2023 rally in Jan, suggesting it may have trend changing potential.
Live Chart
Futures markets also experienced a negative dislocation due to the forced selling, driving futures prices well below the spot market index. Funding rates went negative to create an incentive for market makers to open long positions and arbitrage price differentials.
This is the deepest negative funding rate since the March sell-off to $19.8k, although the dislocation last week is smaller in magnitude. In general, this suggests that the leverage build-up and subsequent deleveraging in futures markets was a primary factor driving this sell-off.

Live Chart
Top Heavy Spot Markets
A concept we revised last week (
WoC 33
) was the notion of a 'top heavy market', where significant volumes of spot supply has a cost basis near or above the current price. When the BTC price moves suddenly, we can see the magnitude of supply that falls into loss via changes in the Percent Supply in Profit metric.
Here we see that 12.8% (2.48M BTC) of the supply fell into an unrealized loss this week, setting a lower low on this metric. This suggests that 'top heaviness' in spot markets may also be a factor in play.
Live Chart
If we look to the response by Long-Term Holders (LTHs), we can see that there is almost no response. The LTH cohort did not meaningfully increase volume sent to exchanges, and their aggregate balance actually ticked up to a new ATH this week.
Thus, we can conclude Short-Term Holders (STHs) are more relevant to assess.
üìä
Related Dashboard
: We have compiled a dashboard with several metrics that describe LTHs, STHs, Whales, and miner volumes

.
Live Chart
With LTH supply at ATH, we can also see that STH supply remains at multi-year lows. However, the chart below overlays the proportion of STH supply which is held at an unrealized loss.
Note how sharp upticks in STH Supply in Loss tend to follow 'top heavy markets' such as May 2021, Dec 2021, and again this week. Out of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, only 300k BTC (11.7%) is still in profit.
Live Chart
The next chart shows the Profit or Loss Bias (dominance) of STH volumes flowing into exchanges. We can see a steady decline in profit dominance as the 2023 rally progressed, as more STHs acquired coins with an increasingly elevated cost basis.
This week we saw the largest loss dominance reading since the March sell-off to $19.8k. This suggests that the STH cohort are both largely underwater on their holdings, and increasingly price sensitive.
Live Chart
Metric Deep Dive: Realized Loss Momentum
Finally, we will close out with one of the more advanced and responsive tools under development by the Glassnode team. The goal of this tool is to identify significant market inflection points, such as 'top or bottom heavy markets'. It is designed as follows:
During macro up-trends, investors generally become increasingly profitable, with losses becoming less frequent (and vice versa in downtrends).
This results the ratio between Realized Profit/Loss (P/L) remaining above 1.0 for sustained periods of time during market up-trends. Conversely, the Loss/Profit (L/P) Ratio remains above 1.0 during downtrends.
If we compare the P/L Ratio to its 1yr moving average, we can establish a
P/L Momentum
indicator üü¢ which will spike higher when profit dominance increases rapidly. This often occurs following a loss dominant regime (such as near bottom-heavy inflection points). A similar
L/P Momentum
üî¥ can be calculated for identifying top-heavy inflection points.
A dominance oscillator (at the bottom of the chart) can also be constructed to provide another perspective for identifying inflection points.
The variant of this metric shown below is specifically for Short-Term Holders who are the most reactive cohort to market volatility. We can see that after several months of declining profit dominance, Loss momentum and dominance have increased meaningfully. False signals do occur such as during the March 2023 correction, and these have historically recovered quickly.
However, sustained declines have also preceded more violent downtrends such as in May and Dec 2021, making this weeks sell-off one to keep a close eye on.

Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market was shaken violently awake this week, selling off -7.2% on 17-Aug, making for the largest single day down move YTD. Many indicators point to a future market deleveraging as the most probable driver, with options traders also forced to rethink and reprice volatility premiums.
Long-Term Holders remain largely unfazed and unresponsive, which is a typical behavior pattern of this cohort during bear market hangover periods. Short-Term Holders however are of greater interest, with 88.3% of their held supply (2.26M BTC) now held at an unrealized loss. This is compounded by an acceleration in STH realized losses being sent to exchanges, as well as the loss of key technical moving average support, putting the bulls on the back-foot."

On-chain Footprints of Exchanges
The chaos of the FTX failure in Nov 2022 was a stark reminder of counter-party risk within the digital asset industry. Whilst hindsight is 20/20, exchanges remain the centrepiece of trade, and thus risk mitigation and management become critical.
The Glassnode suite currently offers on-chain data covering balances and fund flows associated with 20+ centralized exchanges. In this edition, we will present a few components of a framework for assessing exchange risk using on-chain data.
The supply held on centralized exchanges peaked at 3.203M BTC in March 2020, and has steadily declined since. Total exchange balances reached a five-year low this week of 2.256M BTC. Note that these exchange balances consider the direct exchange-related wallet clusters but do not include dedicated custodians or ETF style instruments (like GBTC, or Microstrategy etc.).
Live Professional Chart
One remarkable aspect of this chart is the dominance of the top three exchanges, which have continuously held around ~1.5M BTC since early 2019. The current supply held on these exchanges is estimated to be as follows:
Binance
691.2k BTC
Coinbase
439.8k BTC
Bitfinex
320.7k BTC
Live Professional Chart
The chart below illustrates the relative supply distribution between centralized exchanges üü° and non-exchange entities üü†. We also show
Entity-Adjusted Transfer Volume
as a form of ‚Äòactive‚Äô layer on top üü£, and excluding the 1.457 million BTC considered
Lost Supply
‚ö´
Exchanges reserves comprise 2.31M BTC (11.8%) of the circulating supply, while 122k BTC (0.6%) worth of economic value is transferred on-chain each day.
Live Professional Workbench
Of this 122k BTC volume, exchange deposits or withdrawals account for over 54% of it (67.3k BTC/day, usually 50/50 deposits/withdrawals). As such, observations of the economic flows in and out of exchanges tend to be quite information dense.
Live Advanced Workbench
Exploring Exchange Flows
With an appreciation for the magnitude of exchange flows, we can dive deeper into the funds flowing between entities and exchanges. In the next chart, we have added Exchange inflow and outflow volumes together to form a single metric,
Exchange Fund Flow
üü¶ (with a 90-day average applied).
Here we can see the dominance of
Exchange Fund Flows
üî¥ has reached 54% of economic volumes, and is in a macro uptrend. Exchange dominance reached 58% in June 2021, before falling sharply as global interest rates started accelerating higher, liquidity started tightening and the bear market set in soon after. Dominance started rising again in October 2022 as both global liquidity and the market recovered from the FTX fallout.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can break down the dominance of on-chain volumes flows into four buckets:
üü† Non-exchange related on-chain volume (Entity-Adjusted).
üîµ All Exchange related flows (inflows and outflows).
üü£ Whale-to/from-exchanges: funds transferred to/from whales (1k BTC+) and exchanges.
üî¥ Inter-Exchange flows: funds transferred from one exchange cluster to another.
Inter-exchange flow have remained relatively stable at around 7.5% of total on-chain volume, setting a peak of 11.7% in ¬†June 2021. Meanwhile, the whale-exchange share has recently reached a new all-time high of 17.9% (covered in
WoC 30
).
As we can see, the overall dominance of exchange related flows (54%) üîµ are currently near the all-time-highs.

An Exchange Risk Framework
The first part of this report established a view over the macro dominance that exchanges play in the Bitcoin ecosystem. However in the wake of FTX, exchanges can also be a source of counter-party risk.
In the next section, we aim introduce a framework which may be used to analyze the associated risk for an individual exchange. Throughout this section, we consider the FTX data-set as a reference point for high-risk instances in the future. Reflecting the dominance of Coinbase, and the recent market commentary around Binance and Huobi, we will present data associated with these exchanges for comparison purposes only.
We will present this framework using three indicator constructions:
The Internal Reshuffling Ratio
- the proportion of the exchange balance which is transacted internally over a period of time.
Exchange Reliance Ratio
- the degree to which an exchanges balance moves to/from other exchanges (inter-exchange transfers).
Whale Withdrawal Ratio
- indicators that large entities are withdrawing at elevated rates.
The Internal Reshuffling Ratio
The first indicator considers the ratio of volume transacted within the exchange cluster, and the total balance reserve for the asset of interest. To deliver a comparable indicator across all exchanges and assets, the output values are capped by a range of 0 to 1.
The core idea is to identify situations where more than 100% of the exchange balance has transacted within the exchange cluster over a 7-day period. If this structure persists over a long time, and/or across multiple asset types, it may be warning sign of mismanagement of funds.
For FTX, we can see that their BTC balance sustained values of 1.0 from March 2021 until failure in Nov 2022. We also show an ‚ÄòAggregated Risk‚Äô score considering four of the largest assets BTC, ETH, USDC and USDT.
Live Professional Workbench
If we compare this to the other three exchanges, we can see there are some exchange specific nuances:
Binance (top left):
During periods of major volatility, the reshuffling ratio experiences abrupt peaks across all assets which quickly cool off. Since these are seemingly a market response and are not sustained, it is likely a result of working through new deposits and withdrawals.
Coinbase (top right):
Very few reshuffling events are noted except for USDC which is sustained at 1.0 for long periods. This is highly likely associated with Coinbase‚Äôs partnership with issuer Circle, and acting as a primary venue for USDC on/off boarding.
FTX (btm left): T
he reshuffling ratio of BTC signalled a high-risk status for 14 months prior to the exchange‚Äôs collapse. This in hindsight, was likely a result of Alameda misappropriating customer funds.
Huobi (btm right):
A similar volatility linked activity to Binance is seen for this exchange.
Live Professional Workbenches (
Binance
,
Coinbase
,

,
Huobi
)
The chart below compares the Aggregated Reshuffling Ratios for the four exchanges across the four assets. Here we use a threshold value of 5% (of aggregate balance reshuffled) to flag potentially high-risk events. From this perspective, Binance and Coinbase see very little internal ‚Äòchurn‚Äô of their balances.
FTX stands out for all the wrong reasons, as we now know.
Live Professional Workbenches (
Binance
,
Coinbase
,
FTX
,
Huobi
)
Huobi can be ranked somewhere in between these cases, with a volatility-linked Reshuffling Ratio similar to Binance, however, amplified given the progressively declining asset balance on the exchange (a decreasing denominator).
Live Standard Chart
Exchange Reliance Ratio
Another potential indicator of exchange risk may be when a significant portion of an exchange‚Äôs balance is regularly transferred to/from another exchange. This may suggest an elevated degree of reliance or co-dependence of liquidity between these exchanges.
Similar to the prior section, we have calculated this ratio for the top four assets in the market and capped output values to a range of -1 to 1. We can also see the direction of funds by whether the ratio is positive (net inflows) or negative (net outflows), as well as investigate the source and destination.
Large negative values in this indicator suggest that assets are rapidly flowing out of the subject exchange and moving towards another exchange counter-party, raising an alert if it lasts for a sustained period of time.
Reviewing the top four assets across the aforementioned exchanges:
Binance (top left):
All assets have a neutral and close-to-zero reliance ratio, suggesting fund flowing from or to other exchanges are small by comparison to the balance on Binance. The USDC reliance ratio has been indicating a high deposit rate regime since September 2022, potentially explained by looking at the USDC on Coinbase.
Coinbase (top right):
Similar to Binance, all assets show a neutral reliance ratio. However, the USDC indicator shows a high withdrawal rate since September 2022. This suggests that a significant relocation of USDC supply has been occurring from Coinbase to Binance over the last 12 months.
FTX (btm left):
The Reliance ratios for all four assets were significantly negative well before the exchange failed. This suggests that investors (and Alameda) were withdrawing all major assets towards other exchange accounts.
Huobi (btm right):
Assessing this risk indicator for Huobi, we can see a relatively large negative Reliance Ratio across all assets, suggesting net transfers from Huobi to other exchanges.
Live Professional Workbenches (
Binance
,
Coinbase
,

We again show an aggregated the Reliance Ratio which shows Binance and Coinbase have a very small reliance of -5% or higher, indicating that their behavior is largely independent of other exchanges.
On the other hand, FTX and Huobi have a highly negative aggregated Reliance Ratios, indicating a sustained regime of entities active on other exchanges withdrawing funds from these entities.
Live Professional Workbenches (
Binance
,
Coinbase
,
FTX
,
Huobi
)
Bitcoin Whale Withdrawal Ratio
The final indicator is a tool to monitor whether bitcoin whales are increasing their withdrawal rate. This parameter is calculated as the ratio between total weekly whale outflows and the bitcoin balance on the exchange. In other words, we are looking for the percentage of supply removed by whales over the last seven days.
Alongside the Whale Withdrawal Ratio üüß, we also present the all-time average of this indicator üî¥ as a benchmark over the long-term.
Both Coinbase and Binance show a very low Whale Withdrawal Ratio over last two years, with a long-term average value remaining below 5%.
For FTX, the jump in the Whale Withdrawal Ratio started when LUNA and 3AC collapsed, and sustained high levels right through to the ultimate failure of the exchange itself.
For Huobi, we can see a relatively low-risk pattern up until June 2023. It is over recent months that whale entities have seen a sustained uptick in withdrawal activity relative to the Huobi BTC balance. We note again that this will in part be driven by the sustained drawdown in Huobi BTC balances, which itself is an indicator for heightened awareness.

Summary and Conclusions
The failure of FTX was a painful reminder for the digital asset industry that counterparty risk remains with centralized exchanges and custodians. With hindsight as our guide, we developed three metrics which provide a limited view on some potential risk vectors within exchange entities, leveraging our on-chain data and labelling clusters.
What we find is that through the lens of the
Reshuffling Ratio
,
Reliance Ratio
, and
Whale Withdrawal Ratio
, Coinbase and Binance share a relatively similar and unalarming overall on-chain footprint. FTX, unfortunately stands out as a prime example of risk indicators to watch out for. For Huobi, the persistent decline in their exchange balance across the four major assets BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC will have an amplifying effect on these metrics, however it does suggest that a degree of caution may be warranted.
Note: This report is limited in scope and only considers a small subset of indicators using lessons learned from the FTX event. We considered only the major four assets and four exchanges for brevity, however the concepts can be reformulated and iterated upon for others."

Event driven volatility has re-entered digital assets markets in recent weeks, with notable indicators of aggregate capital outflows flagged leading into it.
Derivative markets show a continual outflow of liquidity, particularly across ETH futures suggesting capital continues to move higher up the risk curve to relative safety.
We deep dive into how Uniswap liquidity pools have many similarities to options markets, with Liquidity Providers expressing a view on both volatility, and price levels.
Digital Asset Markets Wake Up
Over recent weeks, digital asset markets have been shaken awake from a period of historically light volatility. This was driven primarily by two key events:
The flash crash on 17-Aug
where BTC and ETH sold off -11% and -13%, respectively.
News over Greyscale's legal victory over the SEC broke 29-Aug
, driving prices briefly higher, however all gained ground was lost over the following three days.
Spot prices for both BTC and ETH are currently languishing around the August lows.
Live Chart
A key metric for tracking aggregate capital flows into the industry is the Aggregate Realized Value metric. This tool combines:
The realized cap of the two majors BTC and ETH
The supply of leading five stablecoins USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI and TUSD.
From this, it becomes clear that the market had entered a regime of capital outflow in early August, well before these two major events. Approximately $55B in capital has left the digital asset space through August.
This trend is driven by capital outflows across all three assets Bitcoin, Etheruem and stablecoins.
Live Workbench Chart
Within the Ethereum ecosystem, there has been a mixed reaction across indices for the DeFi, GameFi, and Staking sectors. Each index is constructed from the average supply-weighted price of 'Blue-Chip' tokens in the sector.
We can see that DeFi and GameFi tokens have performed relatively poorly (-17%) and (-20%) compared to the majors, whilst Liquid Staking tokens were somewhat better off (-7.7%). Across the board however, the downside price action was similiar or less severe than the downturns seen in March, April and June.
Live Advanced Chart
Risk Appetite Declines Across Derivatives Markets
One of the key developments over the 2021-23 cycle has been the maturation of derivatives markets, especially for BTC and ETH. The way derivatives markets price these assets can provide information about market sentiment and positioning.
General activity across Ethereum futures and options markets in 2023 is notably below levels seen throughout 2021 and 2022. The average daily trade volume across both markets has declined to just $14.3B/day, which is around half the average volume over the last two years. This week, volume is even lower at $8.3B/day, suggesting liquidity continues to drain from the space.
Live Workbench Chart
This trend is mirrored in derivatives Open Interest. Following the market lows set in the wake of the FTX collapse, Open Interest started to climb in early 2023. For Options, open interest peaked during the March banking crisis when USDC experienced a depeg from $1. Ethereum futures open interest peaked around the Shanghai Upgrade, suggesting this was the last major speculative event for the asset.
Since then the notional value of active contracts in both markets has been quite stable. Similar to our observation for BTC markets (
WoC 32
), ETH options markets are now of a similar scale ($5.3B) to future markets ($4.2B), and are in fact larger in size at present.
Live Advanced Chart
Since the beginning of the year, there has been a notable uptick in Ethereum options markets, with volume rising by +256% to a daily trade of $326M/day. Meanwhile, futures volumes have experienced a steady decline this year, falling from $20B/day in early January, to just $8B.day today. ¬†The only notable exception was a brief uptick to around $30B/day around the Shanghai upgrade.
Given there has been no significant shift in trade volumes for either market in August, it suggests that traders are continuing to move liquidity higher up the risk curve.

Looking to the Pull/Call ratio, we can see a high degree of responsiveness to major news events. For example, after BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF, sentiment became more bullish, driving the Pull/Call ratio lower from 0.72 to 0.40.
However, this changed with the sell-off on 17-Aug, as the Pull/Call ratio increased to 0.50, and with call volumes dropping strongly from $320M/day to $140M/day.

Are Liquidity Pools Options Markets?
To bolster our analysis above, we will now examine the activities across Automated Market Makers like the Uniswap ETH/USDC Pool. Since the introduction of concentrated liquidity on Uniswap V3,
a thesis has circulated
Uniswap Liquidity Positions can be considered in a similar light to pricing put and call options. While we do not believe that options concepts describe these dynamics completely, there are certainly many parallels worth exploring further.
Our analysis will focus on the USDC/ETH 0.05% Pool, which is the most active Uniswap pool, and thus can be expected to provide the highest signal. This pool has a 7-day trade volume of $1.51B, and $260m in Total Value Locked (TVL).
Uniswap V3 has a unique feature of concentrated liquidity. Liquidity providers (LPs) can select a price range where their provided liquidity will be concentrated. Fees will only be earned when the market trades in this range (analogous to strike prices), and the tighter the range, the larger the relative fee revenue. This leads to both a better user experience for DEX traders, as spreads tend to be tighter, and improved capital efficiency for LPs.
In this way, it can be argued that the positioning of LPs capital must factor in an expectation of volatility (spread between upper and lower bound), and the expected price ranges (strike level above and below). The thesis is that assuming LPs are actively managing their position, we may be able to draw similar insights to those from options market data.
Source: Uniswap Whitepaper
We begin by observing the general activity in the USDC/ETH 0.05% pool. For various reasons, we will avoid using the TVL metric as a gauge of activity in a pool or a respective token pair. Instead, we will express activity terms of two metrics:
Mints per Day
representing the number of liquidity positions opened by LPs, and
Burns per Day
representing the number of liquidity positions closed by LPs.
By these measures, activity contracted after the March banking crisis, and the Shanghai Upgrade in April, and then remained relatively low until early June. We then see a spike in new Mints and Burns around BlackRock ETF announcement, and then again during the 17-Aug sell-off.
The chart below also shows the net change in LP position counts as a measure of the balance between positions opening and closing. We note that this metric is less affected by market trends but more so by discrete events suggesting short-term volatility is a key motivator.
When examining the distribution of liquidity across different price ranges in the Uniswap pool, we can see that LPs are currently supplying a majority of liquidity above the current price tick.
The most concentrated liquidity (approx 30.4% of capital) is located within an 11% price range, with expected downside of -2.7% and upside of +8.6%. A second tier of liquidity is positioned with a -8.5% buffer to the downside, and a +23.7% buffer to the upside. It could be argued that Uniswap LPs are expressing an expectation of optimism and market upside for ETH in general.
If we compare this to option strike prices for contracts expiring at the end of September, we can see a similar positive outlook. 70% of calls have a strike price between $1.7k and $2.3k, while 75% of puts have a strike between $1.3k and $1.9k. These price levels largely align with the Uniswap Liquidity pool liquidity distribution.
Live Professional Chart
Turning back to the USDC/ETH Uniswap Pool, we can analyze how liquidity concentrations have adjusted over time. The heatmap below shows the density of liquidity, expressed in increasingly cool-to-hot colors.
With the expansion of automated LP strategies and execution, liquidity providers have become quite successful in arranging liquidity very close the spot price during periods of higher volatility. On 1-June, a large amount of liquidity was expanded just above the price at that time (shown in by a deeper yellow zone). This arguably indicated an expectation for higher fee revenue in this zone by market makers. This liquidity prevailed until the flash crash in August, where liquidity concentrations were adjusted to be increasingly below the $1.8k. This chart provides a remarkable view into how responsive LPs are relative to market events and volatility.
It is also interesting to note how high concentrations of liquidity, represented by red zones, coincides with strong price movements and often times trend reversals. By inspection, is does indicate that Uniswap liquidity pools could indeed be a valuable source of information for gauging market sentiment and positioning.
Summary and Conclusion
The initial optimism surrounding Grayscale's victory over the SEC was short-lived, with Ethereum's value dipping back to the August lows within a matter of days. Spot markets continue seeing capital outflows, and derivative markets are also witnessing a persistent decline in liquidity. Overall, investors appear hesitant to return to the markets, preferring to move capital higher up the risk curve.
We performed a study on Uniswap liquidity pools, seeking to identify if similar pricing information to options markets could be obtained. Our analysis demonstrates that liquidity capital is quite responsive to market events, and that insights can likely be found with respect to the volatility and price expectations of LPs."

Liquidity, volatility, and volumes continue to compress across the digital asset market, with many metrics falling back to 2020 pre-bull levels.
Stablecoins are experiencing a persistent decline in supply as redemptions are made across all major stablecoin assets with the exception of Tether (USDT).
The Long-Term Holder cohort are steadfast in their holdings, spending remarkably little of it.
Short-Term holders on the other hand are teetering on the edge of profitability, with a large majority of their supply acquired above the current price range.
The digital asset market has returned to a remarkably narrow trading range, experiencing a regime of compressed volatility, and exceptionally light volumes. All in all, it can be argued that extreme apathy and boredom best describe the prevailing sentiment. In recent weeks, we have explored how this is being expressed in both derivatives markets (
WoC 32
) and on-chain data (
WoC 33
). In last week's
video report
, we detailed some of the driving factors, primarily related to a regime of net capital outflows.
In this edition, we will further explore this drying up of liquidity, and how we can use on-chain data to better characterize this market structure.

Stable Supply Declines
We will begin our study with a macro view of capital flows into the industry. Here, we consider the aggregate invested capital held within the three major assets, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins.
üü¢ Stablecoins have experienced a persistent decline in supply since April 2022, as redemption commenced following the collapse of LUNA-UST.
Both üü† BTC and üîµ ETH experienced a net inflow of capital since the start of the year, seeing their Realized Cap's climb by up to $6.8B/mth (BTC) and $4.8B/mth, respectively.
Since late August however, all three assets have seen a return to neutral or negtative inflows, suggesting a degree of stagnation and uncertainty has taken over.
Live Advanced Workbench
If we isolate stablecoins, we can see that a total of $43B in capital has been redeemed, representing a total decline of 26% since the high set in March 2022. This can be argued to be a result of both capital leaving due to bear market conditions, but also a reflection of the opportunity cost of higher interest rates, which are not passed onto non-yielding stablecoins.
Live Advanced Workbench
Breaking down the three largest stablecoins, we can that these dynamics are not evenly distributed:
üü¢ USDT supplies have actually expanded by +$13.3B since the current cycle lows set in Nov 2022.
üîµ USDC has seen an almost equal and opposite decline of -$16.7B, likely in part a reflection of US based institutions moving capital towards higher interest rate markets.
üü° BUSD has seen a dramatic decline of $20.4B (-89%), largely due to issuer Paxos moving into a redemption only mode following SEC enforcement.
Live Advanced Workbench
If we look at it through the lends of relative dominance, we can see just how significant the expansion of Tether's market share is. USDT now represents 69% of the stablecoin market, a stark reversal from the 44% low in dominance hit in June 2022.
BUSD dominance has fallen to 2.1%, and USDC to just 21.7%, a significant fall from the peak of 38% reached a little over a year ago.
Live Advanced Workbench
On a shorter term horizon, we can look at the relative buy-side vs sell-side for the three major assets flowing into exchanges. Here we make a set of simple assumptions:
We assume the USD value of BTC and ETH flowing into exchanges is a proxy for 'sell-side' pressure.
We assume the USD value of stablecoins flowing into exchanges is a proxy for 'buy-side' pressure.
The chart below calculates the net USD difference between Stablecoin inflows (+ve) and BTC + ETH inflows. What we are looking for is less the absolute magnitude (as there will be error bars around these assumptions), but more-so any significant regime shifts.
üü¢
Positive values suggest a net buy-side regime
, where buy-side of stablecoins exceed BTC+ETH sell-side.
üî¥
Negative values suggest a net sell-side regime
, where buy-side of stablecoins are less than BTC+ETH sell-side.
The 2021 bull cycle was clearly dominated by net sell-side pressure as investors took profits during the mania of the uptrends. The collapse of LUNA-UST and 3AC in mid 2022 signified a shift back towards net accumulation, as investors worked to establish a market floor.
Since April this year however, the market has returned to a relatively neutral level, aligned with the slow-down in BTC and ETH capital inflows, and the market becoming increasingly apathetic and uncertain.
Live Advanced Workbench
It is Quiet On-chain...
Despite the volatility spike experienced during the recent sell-off to $26k, and then again during following Grayscale's successful challenge of the SEC in the courts, Realized Volatility has remained remarkably low. The market is still in a historically low volatility environment, which is usually a precursor to heightened volatility down the road.
Live Advanced Chart
This low liquidity and low volatility environment is also reflected across Bitcoin network settlement volumes. The total USD volume of coins changing hands (using our entity-adjustment clustering) is languishing around cycle lows of $2.44B/day, and has returned to October 2020 levels.
Live Professional Chart
If we look at the realized value settled on-chain (being the delta between coin acquisition and disposal prices) we see that this remains extremely quiet. There is minimal profit or loss being locked in by the market overall, suggesting a majority of the coins which are transacting are within close proximity to their original acquisition price.
Realized Profit and Loss are similarly at levels equivalent to the 2020 market, highlighting what is arguably a complete and total wash-out of the exuberance from the 2021 bull market.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also track this on-chain illiquidity and apathetic sentiment by observing the proportion of wealth held in the most active and liquid subsection of the market, the ‚ÄòHot Supply‚Äô cohort (coins moved within the last week).
The realized value held in this 'Hot Supply' cohort old resides at historical lows, suggesting that very few coins which are older than 1-week are transacting at present.
Live Advanced Chart
It Is Quiet Off-chain Too...
Moving across to off-chain derivatives markets, we can see that futures trading volumes have succumbed to a similar fate, hitting historical lows of $12B/day. The only period with lighter trade volume was the lull at the end of 2022, where the Bitcoin price traded within a $557 range for over two weeks (
WoC 2
).
Live Advanced Chart
We have noticed an interesting divergence in Options markets however, where trade volumes have increased meaningfully in 2023, currently at $437M/day. This could be a reflection of the market preferring to use the leverage and capital efficiency of options to express their view during a period of tighter overall liquidity conditions.
It is important to note that whilst options markets now have a comparable magnitude of open interest relative to futures markets, options trade volumes remain an order of magnitude smaller.
Live Advanced Chart
Again, despite a few days of sharp volatility over the last month, options markets continue to price in relatively low implied volatility. The initial uptick in volatility premium was short-lived, with 1-month implied volatility trading back at historical lows of 33.9% once again.
Live Professional Chart
The Market HODLs On
With both the on- and off-chain domains being exceptionally quiet, it is of no surprise that the supply held by the Long-Term Holder cohort has reached a new ATH of 14.74M BTC. Conversely, the supply held within the Short-Term cohort, representing the more active portion of the market, has fallen to the lowest supply held since 2011.
HODLing certainly remains the primary market dynamic, which both signals a steady conviction amongst existing holders, but highlights that these investors are likely the only ones who remain.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can find confluence within the Liveliness metric, which elegantly compares the balance of all time Coinday Destruction to Coinday Creation. In other words, Liveliness represents the relative balance of 'investor holding time' across the market.
Aligned with the net sell-side regime we covered above, 2021 saw a significant uptick in Liveliness, as older coins were spent and took profits. As the 2022 bear market set in between May and Dec 2021, a strong downtrend was established. This marked an inflection point from a traders market, towards a HODLer market.
Liveliness has now reset to late 2020 conditions, and is seeing a progressively steeper downtrend. This indicates that aggregate 'investor holding time' is increasing, and investors are increasingly unwilling to spend and part with their held coins.

.
A key insight from this work was the development of the True Market Mean price, which we argue is the most accurate 'cost basis' model for active Bitcoin investors. This model is currently located at $29.6k, and has formed a psychological resistance level since April of this year. The traditional Realized Price is trading at $20.3k, with both models bounding much of the years price action.
Live Advanced Workbench
Market Sensitivity
If we apply these two pricing models as psychological boundaries to the URPD chart, we can better characterize the supply acquired between these two models. At present, over 4.81M BTC have a cost basis between $20.3k and $29.6k.
We can also see that with prices trading just under $26k at the time of writing, Short-Term Holders üî¥ are almost entirely underwater on their position. It could be argued that this puts this more price sensitive cohort a little bit on edge.
Live in Engine Room
The chart below shows the percent of Short-Term Holder supply in Profit. We can see that the vast majority of their supply has been plunged into an unrealized loss, with only 16.3% of their supply still held 'in profit'.
Live Professional Workbench
For the Long-Term Holder cohort, their profitability is gradually increasing, although is still historically low, and has only left the minus one standard deviation band a few months ago. Whilst this is a constructive trend, over 26.7% of LTH supply is underwater relative to their acquisition price, and well below the all-time-mean.
Whilst 2023 has been a fairly reasonable recovery for Bitcoin and digital assets, these findings would suggest there are still several psychological cost basis barriers that must still be overcome.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Volatility, liquidity, trade volumes and on-chain settlement volumes are at historical lows. This reinforces the probability that the market has entered a period of extreme apathy, exhaustion, and arguably boredom.
The Long-Term HODLer cohort remain steadfast, relinquishing very little of their held supply. The Short-Term Holder cohort on the other hand are teetering on the edge of profitability, with many coins holding a cost basis above the current $26k trading range. This suggests that this cohort are increasingly price sensitive, and that many psychological price levels are yet to be overcome."

We review the market position relative to two on-chain pricing models, both of which are intersected during past cycle lows, and in the March 2020 sell-off.
Patterns of accumulation and distribution tend to align with local highs and lows, and we demonstrate how this plays out in on-chain data.
A super-majority of Short-Term Holders are now underwater on their position, with a new indicator suggesting negative sentiment dominates this cohort at present.
Finding Floors
The Bitcoin market continues to languish around $26k, after prices failed to hold above the cycle midpoint level at around $31.4k. Both attempts in April and July effectively set a double top pattern in prices. Amongst other indicators related to Short-Term Holders covered last week (
WoC 37
), this may suggest the market is experiencing an early stage shift in market psychology and confidence.
The chart below presents two pricing models:
üü¢
Investor Price
($17.6k) which reflects the average acquisition price for all coins excluding those acquired by miners (i.e. in secondary markets).
üü£
Delta Price
($11.1k) which is a combined on-chain and technical pricing model, often used to model cycle floors.
Price action across both the 2018-19 and 2022-23 cycles spent a similar amount of time trading within the bounds of these price models at the lows. Of note is that the market revisited the Investor Price level during the chaos of the March 2020 sell-off.

A suite of both technical and on-chain pricing models are available within the

In addition to the duration spent between these models, we can also measure the compression and expansion between these price models as a gauge for the market recovery. The distance between these models will compress near cycle tops as large volumes of capital flow into the market. Conversely, divergence indicates a softer inflow of capital, where declining prices becomes the driving factor.
This model can be used to monitor the transition from the deepest phase of a bear market back towards a market recovery. From this we can see that the prevailing market structure is similar in nature to the the decompression phase seen in 2016, and also in 2019.
Live Advanced Workbench
Capital Rotation Cycles
The Realized HODL Ratio (RHODL) is a market indicator that tracks the balance of invested wealth held within recently moved coins (<1-week) and more mature HODLers (1-2 years). In the next chart, we have applied a 2-year (half cycle) Median üîµ as a threshold value for periods where capital flow regimes transition between bull and bear market structure.
We can see that by this measure, 2023 has seen a modest influx of new investors, however, the RHODL Ratio is only just contesting with the 2-year median level. The influx of new investors is positive but relatively weak in momentum.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can also visualize this positive but soft inflow of capital by leveraging the Accumulation Trend Score. This tool reflects the relative balance change of active investors over the past 30 days.
Here we can see that the 2023 recovery rally was fuelled by significant accumulation into the local tops above $30k. This describes a degree of FOMO üî¥ by investors. This is in contrast to capitulation events in the second half of 2022, where new investors seized the opportunity and accumulated at the lows üü¢.
Live Advanced Chart
Zooming into this behaviour near recent market tops, we can use the Realized Profit and Loss indicators to assess sudden changes in investor profitability. Realized profit and loss metrics measure the change in the the value of all spent coins, comparing the value at disposal to the value at acquisition. The chart below shows the weekly sum of realized profit üü© and loss üü•, normalized by Market Cap to compare across cycles.
Here, we can see that a confluence emerges between these periods of intense accumulation, and elevated profit-taking. Both were present at the local tops in 2023, and a similar confluence exists at the 2021 market peaks in Jan and Dec.

Underwater Holders
In last week's edition, we reviewed a set of metrics exploring how a significant proportion of Short-Term Holders are now holding coins at a loss, shown below as a percentage of STH Supply in Profit üîµ.
During bear markets, when more than 97.5% of the supply acquired by new investors are at loss üü•, the chance of seller exhaustion increases exponentially. On the other hand, when more than 97.5% of short-term holder supply is in profit, these players tend to take advantage of the opportunity and exit at break-even or with a profit üü©.
During the rally above $30k, this metric reached complete profit saturation for the first time since the Nov-2021 all-time high. However, since selling off below $26k in recent weeks, more than 97.5% of STH supply is now held at a loss, being the deepest level since FTX collapsed.
Live Professional Workbench
With so many Short-Term Holders now underwater, we can assess their position using two powerful metrics:
STH-MVRV
which describes the magnitude of
Unrealized Profit/Loss
held, and a gauge on the financial incentive to sell.
STH-SOPR
which describes the magnitude of
Realized Profit/Loss
locked in, providing a gauge on actualized sell-side pressure.
Starting with STH-MVRV, we can assess extremes in this indicator relative to its 155-day averageÔ∏è, as well as an Upper Band (mean plus one standard deviation) üü¢ and a Lower Band (mean minus one standard deviation) üî¥.
We can see that several of the recent market highs and lows occurred alongside significant deviations outside these boundaries. This indicates that recent investors were in a statistically large degree of profit or loss at the time.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can see similar behaviour in the STH-SOPR indicator, which indicates that these investors were also taking action, opting to take profits near the highs and sell coins at a statistically meaningful loss near the lows.
Live Advanced Workbench
Shifting Confidence
Now that we have established a relationship between abrupt changes in implied (unrealized) profitability and the shift in spending by STHs (realized profitability), we will now introduce a method to assess the trend direction of this relationship.
The aim is to gauge the tides of shifting sentiment for new investors, constructed by looking at the deviation between the cost basis of two subgroups; holders and spenders.
üü•
Negative Sentiment
is when the cost basis of spenders is
lower
than holders.
üü©
Positive Sentiment
is when the cost basis of the spenders is
higher
than holders.
From this perspective, we can see that the cost basis of STHs who are spending fell below the cost basis of holders as the market sold off from $29k to $26k in mid-August. This suggests a degree of panic and negative sentiment has taken hold in the near term.
Live Advanced Workbench
To better visualize this indicator, we have normalized this metric by the spot price.
Remarkably, the macro range for this indicator is largely bounded between extremes of -0.25 to 0.25, with occasional out of range spikes at market extreme pivot point. Here we will also disregard the neutral transitional range of -0.05 to 0.05 üüß (which is arbitrary)
The first key insight is that intervals of negative sentiment during the recovery from the bear market typically last between 1.5 to 3.5 months. As noted, the market recently entered the first negative sentiment interval since the end of 2022.
Analysts can consider this tool when monitoring for positive shifts in STH sentiment. Should the trend start rising back towards the transitional and then positive territory (> -0.05), it would suggest that capital is starting to flow back into the market, and holders are back in a more favourable position.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market is experiencing a non-trivial shift in sentiment, with almost all Short-Term Holders now underwater on their supply. This has resulted in a negative shift in sentiment, with investors spending now having a lower cost basis than the rest of the cohort. This suggests a degree of panic is dominating this group, which is the first time since FTX collapsed.
Several metrics suggest that 2023 has seen a positive, but low momentum influx of new capital and new investors. This speaks to the persistent uncertainty coming from the macro-economic conditions, regulatory pressures, and tightness of liquidity across all markets."

Inscriptions act as a form of buyer of last resort for cheap blockspace, and appear to be sensitive to the absolute fee paid.
Inscriptions are best thought of as a sort of 'packing filler' which is stuffed into any remaining space once the higher value monetary transfers are packed into blocks.
Analysis of fees and volume need to consider that there can be a higher perception of 'value' assigned to the inscriptions beyond the BTC volume being transferred and held.
Despite a meaningful uptick in fee revenue for miners, the halving event is likely to put many of them into extreme income stress unless BTC prices increase meaningfully.

Full Mempools
Inscriptions have been a major consumer of Bitcoin blockspace since their introduction in Feb 2023. In this edition, we will explore how Inscriptions have changed the landscape of on-chain activity, Mempools, and miner revenues, and what it may look like on the road ahead.
The 'Bitcoin mempool' can be thought of as a cloud of unconfirmed transactions which are all awaiting inclusion in a block by miners. Every Bitcoin node actually has its own unique mempool, defined by both the rules set by the node operator, but also by the transactions that it 'knows about' from the peer-to-peer gossip network.
The chart below shows the data size of the highest fee paying transactions in the Glassnode mempool over the last year. Of note is the significant uptick in blockspace demand which started in February, aligned with the release of Ordinals and Inscriptions. This elevated demand has been sustained ever since.
Live Chart
Whilst our mempool has been 'data-full' since February, we can see that the number of pending transactions has actually increased significantly since May. This indicates that a majority of these unconfirmed transactions have a very small data-footprint (more transactions fit within the 300MB capacity of the Glassnode mempool).
Live Chart
Inscriptions allow Bitcoin users to encode files into the witness portion of the transaction data structure. The chart below shows that there have been two waves of inscriptions thus far:
üü†
Wave 1: Images and files,
dominated as users used the Ordinal protocol to create Bitcoin native NFTs, and explore the new technology.
üîµ
Wave 2: Text
dominated, as the experimental BRC-20 token emerged using text based JSON files to define asset minting and transfers.
The explosion of text based inscriptions aligns clearly with the uptick in pending transactions within our mempool. This confirms that these small size text inscriptions have become a significant source of demand for blockspace.
Live Chart
Inscriptions take advantage of the split data structure introduced with SegWit, making it possible fit more transactions in the same 4M Wu capped blocksize. Until inscriptions gained popularity, the maximum number of (mainly monetary) transactions which could be fit into a block tended to peak at around 375k to 400k/day, usually hit in bull markets.
2023 however saw and incredible uptick in daily confirmed transaction counts, breaching 550k per day both in May, and again this week.
Live Chart
A similar pattern can be seen in the average number of confirmed transactions per block. In prior years where monetary transfers were the primary use of Bitcoin blockspace, full blocks typically contained between 2.25k and 2.50k transactions.
In 2023 however, that ceiling has been taken out, with the additional space available in the witness data allowing for the average block to contain between 2.80k and 3.50k transactions (with daily spikes even reaching over 4.0k per block).
Live Chart
Out of all confined transactions, text based inscriptions account for between 40% and up to 60% of all transactions since May. This dwarfs the first wave of image dominant inscriptions which typically represented just 7.5% of all transactions.
Live Chart
One notable impact of inscriptions is a rapidly expanding UTXO set. Since February, the total number of UTXOs in the set has increased by +46.2M (+33.8%). This is the largest rate of weekly increase in history, sustaining levels between 300k to 450k UTXOs/wk for the over six months.
Of note is the
BRC-20 token called
SATS
, which was launched in March, but only finished minting out this week. This token alone is responsible for at least 21M new UTXOs, around 45.5% of the increase. It remains to be seen whether mempools start to clear now that this multi-month token mint has completed.
Live Chart
Inscriptions Are Buyers of Last Resort
The percent of blockspace consumed by Image vs Text based inscriptions is almost the exact inverse of the share of transactions. The first wave of Image inscriptions routinely consumed a fairly large 40%+ of the available blockspace. The second wave of text inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens on the other hand has consumed a relatively stable 20% or less, reflecting their smaller data footprint.
This is quite an interesting observation, as it suggests that these text based inscriptions are acting somewhat like 'filler' for blocks.
By way of analogy, think about a Bitcoin block as a moving crate:
Monetary transfers and Image inscriptions represent the the contents of the crate and are fewer in number, but consume the majority of the crate volume and value.
Text inscriptions on the other hand represent a soft newspaper packing which can be stuffed into any remaining space, but on the whole consumes relatively little volume and value.
Live Chart
This analogy is further reinforced by the share of fees paid by Inscriptions. Here we can see that both waves hit a ceiling of around 20% of transaction fees being attributed to inscriptions.
Since Bitcoin transaction fees are paid on a per-data basis (fee per byte), inscriptions tend to be relatively sensitive to the size of the absolute fee. As such, inscription users have tended to set relatively low fee rates, expressing a willingness to wait longer periods of time for confirmation.
Inscriptions appear to be buying and consuming the cheapest available blockspace, and are readily displaced by more urgent monetary transfers.
Live Chart
We can see this by comparing the Mean and Median transfer volumes:
üî¥
Mean Transfer Volumes
are more representative of monetary transfers. We can see that the average tends to follow bull and bear cycles, with consistently higher peaks and troughs over time (currently at $36k).
üîµ
Median Transfer Volumes
are more representative of smaller investors (historically) and in more recent times, inscriptions (in 2023).
Note how the median transfer volume have waterfall collapsed to just $7.30 this year. This is a direct result of inscriptions becoming a dominant transaction type, which are numerous (hence affecting ther median), and transported on a very small BTC volume of just a few hundred to thousand sats (usually less than 0.0001000 BTC ~ $2.60) .
Live Chart
We can also see this dynamic through the lens of
Fee Paid per Unit Transferred
.
The average transaction fee is typically between 0.001% and 0.01% of the volume spent, which is an intuitive and expected result.
For Median fee rates however, we see that high urgency transactions have been willing to pay up to 1.2% fees during bull market peaks, as the market entered a state of euphoria. In 2023, we have seen this translate across to inscriptions, where fees as high as 10% and even over 50%+ of the value transferred becoming increasingly common.
This reflects a willingness to pay a priority fee based on the perceived value of the inscription, and less so relative to the small ~10k sats in value which is transferred.
Live Chart
Do Inscriptions Impact Miner Incomes?
Naturally, as blockspace demand increases, miner revenues will be positively affected. Whilst the fee spike in May was historically large, it has since cooled off, and both total fees and their relative share of miner income remain relatively low.
Both metrics have lifted above their typical 'bear market' levels; total fees have increased by 216% from ~12 BTC/day to 38 BTC/day, and the the proportion of the miner income from fees has increased from 1% to 4%. Both are meaningful increases, however are still small in an absolute and historical context.
Live Chart
Meanwhile, the amount of hashrate competing for these rewards has increased by 50% since February, as more miners, and newer ASIC rigs are established and come online.
Live Chart
This has driven the hashprice, being the BTC or USD reward earned per Exahash, towards new all-time-lows. Miners will now earn just 2.26 BTC (~$60k) per Exahash active on the network.
The endless logarithmic descent of hashprice shows just how cut-throat and unforgiving the mining industry is.
Live Chart
In a prior study, we attempted to estimate the average all-in cost of production for BTC via a regression model between Market Cap and difficulty. Based on this model, the average miner acquisition price is around $24.3k, which is less than a 10% premium to the current spot price.
This suggests that miners may be on the brink of becoming unprofitable, especially with the
halving event now an estimated 206-days away
.
Live Chart
Another approach to estimating the cost of BTC production is via relative issuance to difficulty. By this model, we estimate that the most efficient miners on the network have an acquisition price of around $15.1k.
However, the purple curve shows the post-halving 'doubling' of this level to $30.2k, which would likely put the majority oif the mining market into severe income stress.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
With inscriptions now having several months of history to study, we find that they act as a sort of 'packing-filler' for blocks. There is minimal evidence that inscriptions are displacing monetary transfers, instead acting as a buyer of last resort for cheap blockspace.
Whilst this has improved the base-load demand for blockspace, and increased fee revenue meaningfully, the hashrate competing for it is also up over 50% since February. With extreme miner competition in play, and the halving event looming, it is likely that miners are on the edge of income stress, with their profitability to be tested unless BTC prices increase in the near term."

The rise of liquid staking has reshaped the Ethereum supply composition and the dynamics of ETH emission, with a notable presence of Lido driving these dynamics.
We are witnessing an upward trend in the adoption of stETH, especially when contrasted with ETH, which has experienced a stagnation in demand.
stETH has taken over from ETH as the preferred asset on lending platforms. This shift is mainly propelled by the appeal of leveraged stETH positions, which seem to offer more attractive yields compared to providing liquidity through stETH-ETH pairs on decentralized exchanges.

Liquid Staking on the Rise
Since the introduction of the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to the Ethereum network, a new phenomenon has emerged: Liquid staking.

In essence, liquid staking projects enable individuals to delegate their ETH to the project’s node operators, who in turn stake the ETH on their behalf. In return, the individuals receive a representation of their staked ETH known as Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) or Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).

In the context of these new developments, the composition of the circulating ETH supply has changed. Currently, 23% of the ETH supply is staked, with 32% of that being staked via the largest liquid staking service provider, Lido. This also means that 7% of the ETH supply is being replaced by Lido’s staking derivative, stETH. This shift is showing a rising tendency.

💡
Note: This report is experimenting with interactive charts which may need just a few extra moments to load than usual. They can also be expanded by clicking the square icon in the bottom right corner.

Usually, staked ETH serves as security for validators and is locked up. However, liquid staking derivatives allow users to reuse their staked ETH, for example in DeFi protocols, while still receiving staking rewards. These derivatives are backed by the equivalent amount of staked ETH, and can be redeemed through the liquid staking platform at any time.

This appealing feature of liquid staking is the driving force behind the current trend of increased staking through liquid staking providers, with Lido currently dominating the field with an 86% market share. We therefore continue this analysis by evaluating Lido's staking derivatives stETH and its wrapped version, wstETH.


stETH's Impact on ETH Supply
Since the merge, the issuance of newly created ETH is solely generated from the rewards paid out to validators.

As Lido owns 32% of the staking pool, they subsequently receive 32% of the validator's rewards, and consequently, 32% of the newly created ETH is distributed into the ETH economy via Lido. To understand the impact this might have for the ETH supply, we should take a closer inspection at Lido's reward mechanisms. Lido's reward structure consists of three layers:

🟠 Consensus Layer Rewards in the form of rewards paid on top of the staked ETH account for the largest portion of the protocol rewards at 68.8%
🔴 MEV rewards are a form of extra fee for being included in a certain position within a block and are the second largest at 28.4%.
🔵 Priority Fees paid for transacting on the network constitute the remaining 3.72% of rewards.


The gross annual percentage rate for Lido is determined by the overall consensus layer APR and the execution layer APR, which are based on the rewards received by Lido validators in relation to the total pooled Ether. As of writing, the total Protocol APR is 4.07%.

Lido charges a 10% fee on staking rewards with the fee split between both the node operators and the protocol's treasury. This applies to both execution layer rewards and consensus layer rewards.

When considering Lido's consensus layer reward distribution in terms of the 32% of the newly created ETH, we observe a different emission dynamic compared to what was envisioned by the Ethereum protocol. Unlike solo stakers who receive all validator rewards, and hence newly created ETH, Lido only distributes 1.6% of the newly created ETH to node operators (assuming they are not holders of stETH). Another 1.6% goes into the Lido Treasury, whilst 28.8% is distributed to stETH holders.


Furthermore, Lido compounds the rewards earned by validators, by restaking the rewards earned from Priority Fees and MEV. Currently, around 104k ETH has been restaked, which contributes to a compounding effect of 1.24% of the Protocol APR.

Lido's compounding strategy offsets parts of the ETH emission through the Consensus Layer Rewards. While 3.2% of the rewards are distributed as described above, an additional 0.95% of the total rewards are locked away in the staking pool. In total, this amounts to Lido receiving a total of 221k in newly created ETH (see previous chart), whilst 105k ETH is locked again in the staking pool, resulting in net emission of 116k ETH.


stETH's Impact on ETH Demand
Lido mints stETH for every ETH staked with its node operators, as well as for the rewards received from staking activities. All stETH holders receive an automatic update of their the account based on the rewards they are eligible to making stETH a yield-bearing version of ETH. Due to the attractiveness stETHs yield-bearing properties compared to ETH, there are beliefs circulating that stETH could replace ETH as Ethereum's reserve currency.

To determine if Lido's stETH is tapping into the demand for ETH, we examine the recent adoption of both ETH and its wrapped version, WETH, in comparison to stETH and its wrapped version, wstETH. By comparing the trends using a 30D-SMA, we observe that the number of new addresses using ETH + WETH has stalled since the Terra Luna Collapse in May 2022, whilst demand for stETH + wstETH has increased by 142% during the same period.


When observing the transfer volume, a similar trend can be noted with both ETH + WETH, experiencing an increase in volume ranging from $6B to $10B on average throughout 2022. However, this volume flattened out at the beginning of 2023.

Conversely, stETH reached a peak volume in the spring of 2022 and remained relatively stable for the rest of the year. However, in 2023, it gained momentum again, jumping from $127M, to a range of $450M - $880M.


stETH's Impact on DeFi
When comparing the usage of ETH and stETH in DeFi, we shall primarily focus on the wrapped alternatives of both tokens as proxy for demand due to their support in the majority of DeFi applications.

Since the beginning of 2022, a significant increase in the supply of the wstETH can be observed, with an additional 3M+ tokens issued. This suggests a growing preference amongst users to hold wstETH instead of stETH.

However, it is worth noting that only 70.5% of the wstETH supply is held in smart contracts. The large number of individual wstETH holders can be attributed to tax regulations. With the automatic balance updates of stETH being seen as taxable income, users may prefer to hold the wrapped version that only increases in value without increasing the number of tokens.

In comparison, wETH supply has decreased by 62% within the same period, indicating a lack of demand for the wrapped version of ETH. This provides confluence with the observation of reduced usage of wETH in smart contracts.


When analyzing the breakdown of stETH supply into its token holders, whilst taking into account that wstETH replaces 74% of the stETH supply, we can observe that Lido's staking derivative has found significant adoption within Aave's lending protocol. Approximately 14.4% of the stETH and 25.3% of the wstETH supply are utilized in Aave.

Of note, only a small percentage of Lido's staking derivative is being used on decentralized exchanges (DEX). Among the DEXes, Curve holds the highest amount of stETH liquidity, which represents a mere 1.4% of the total stETH supply.


This is a concerning number, considering that stETH and wstETH are traded primarily on DEXes. In this context, we reiterate the points raised in the previous Week on Chain 27 regarding the receeding liquidity of stETH.

As depicted in the charts below, Curve, the largest trading venue for stETH, has experienced a 90.2% decrease in stETH reserves for the top three stETH pools since May 2022.

Concurrently, Aave has experienced an influx of Lido's staked ETH, with an increase of approximately 53.6%. The stETH reserves have been evenly divided between the two versions of Aave. This transition is likely be driven by the fact that leveraged stETH positions offer more attractive yields compared to providing liquidity for stETH on DEXes.

The shift from DEXes to lending platforms like Aave has reduced liquidity for stETH, which potentially poses risks in terms of stETH depegging as well as the creation of bad debt on Aave. This is because the liquidity available on DEXes may not be sufficient for the liquidation of these loans.


Summary and Conclusion
The rise of liquid staking has brought about significant changes in the composition of the Ethereum (ETH) supply and the dynamics of newly created ETH. Lido, a major player in the staking pool, has altered the flow of new ETH entering the economy through its restaking strategy.

Furthermore, a portion of the newly minted ETH is distributed to sETH holders, who may exhibit different characteristics and behavior patterns compared to validators. Which leads to the assumption that a notable portion of the newly minted ETH from Lido is being directed towards DeFi applications

This shift has also seen stETH replace ETH in Aave, presumably due to leveraged stETH positions offering higher yields than providing liquidity with stETH-ETH pairs on decentralized exchanges. This development carries the potential risk of stETH losing its peg to the underlying asset and could also lead to challenges related to handling bad debt on Aave."

The On-Chain landscape remains extremely illiquid with waning capital flows, low network settlement and HODLing remaining the primary dynamic.

Dormant Coins
We shall start with an evaluation of the current structure of the Realized Cap. Following a brief and modest period of capital inflows to Bitcoin through the first half of the year, the Realized Cap has stabilized, reaching a point of relative indecision.
As the Realized Cap trades sideways, it suggests that very few coins transferred on-chain are experiencing a significant net change in their acquisition price (i.e. minimal profit or loss taking events).
Live Advanced Workbench
We can see this from the perspective of Long-Term Holder Supply, which continues to reach new all-time-highs over 14.859M BTC. This is equivalent to 76.1% of the circulating supply which has not transacted in the last 5-months.
Live Advanced Chart
The HODLer Net Position Change metric tells a similar story, where the market is experiencing a sustained regime of coin dormancy. Over +50k BTC per month are currently being Vaulted by HODLers, suggesting both a tightening supply, and a widespread reluctance to transact.
Live Professional Chart
Supply Tightens
This observation is reinforced by an assessment the the Average BTC Volume Transferred per Active Entity, which has fallen to a value of $12.2k (approx 0.44 BTC). This metric has returned to levels seen in late 2017 (end of the bull run) and again in late 2020 (prior to the last cycle bull run).
Live Professional Workbench
This lull in market liquidity is strikingly apparent when evaluating the ‚ÄòHot Supply‚Äô metric, being the volume of coins which have transacted within the last week. To demonstrate just how quiet the Bitcoin supply is, we compare Hot Supply to its long-term mean minus 0.5 standard deviations.
From this, we construct a framework to highlights periods of low and contracting market liquidity, where Hot Supply is below this Mean - 0.5SD level. These highlighted areas show that the current liquidity conditions remain similar to the 2014-15 and 2018-19 bear markets, having been in this condition for 535-days.
Live Advanced Workbench
The volume of Illiquid Supply is also climbing, moving in the opposite direction to aggregate Exchange Balances.
This divergence is another piece of evidence that coins continue to be withdrawn from exchanges, moving into illiquid HODLer owned wallets, where they are generally ageing into Long-Term Holder status.
Live Professional Workbench
Exchanges
We have established that the on-chain BTC supply remains exceptionally dormant, with both value transferred and the influx of new capital being historically muted. With Exchanges remaining the primary venues for trade, we can profile flows in and out as a gauge for investor activity.
The 30-day and 365-day average of total exchange volumes (inflows plus outflows) is hovering around $1.5B, which is a substantial decline (75.5%) relative to the ATH of $6B set in May 2021.
Live Professional Workbench
The volume of Profit and Loss realized by coins sent to Exchange Addresses has also experienced a complete detox from the 2021-22 cycle, with both measures hitting the lowest levels seen since 2020.
Live Professional Workbench
The average Profit or Loss realized per coin has also reached cycle lows, reinforcing the observation that the majority of coins being traded were last transacted at a similar price to today. We also note that profits are equal to losses, suggesting a state of equilibrium has been reached (an indicator for heightened volatility ahead).
With the majority of coins transacting in close proximity to their original cost basis, this describes a market where active investors are either price insensitive HODLers, or traders jostling for a marginally better position.
Live Professional Workbench
Modelling Altseason
With so little occurring on-chain, this next section will explore a more fundamental concept, being the rotation of capital which often referred to as ‚Äòalt-season‚Äô. From this we will construct a novel tool to assess periods where ‚Äòalt-season‚Äô capital rotation appears to be underway.
Historically, Bitcoin tends to lead the digital asset market, with market confidence then flowing towards Ethereum, and then further out on the risk curve from there.
A powerful tool to visualise this capital rotation is using the 30-day change in the Realized Cap for üü† BTC and üîµ ETH, and the total supply of üü¢ Stablecoins (as a proxy for USD quote capital, often deployed for speculation).
Live Advanced Workbench
In order to normalize these net position change metrics, we convert this 30-day change to a relative percentage of the Realized Cap (BTC and ETH) or total supply (Stablecoins).
Next, we construct a simple model to identify whether the market is within a risk-on, or a risk-off environment, respectively:
üü¢
Risk-on
is defined when all three of these major assets are exhibiting net capital inflows.
üî¥
Risk-off
is defined if any of the three major assets starts to exhibit net capital outflows.
Live Advanced Workbench
With this broad view of risk on/off environments defined, we can apply one more constraint to filter for periods of explosive Altseason mania within a primary uptrend. With all three majors exhibiting positive capital flows, we then filter only for events where capital is rotating towards to Ethereum and Stablecoins.
This model is accomplished by looking for a positive and increasing 30-day change in the ETH Realized Cap and Stablecoin Total Supply (i.e a positive second derivative). This model simulates the waterfall effect of capital rotating from larger caps, into small caps.
The conditions are as follows:
Risk on
remains when all three majors are exhibiting capital inflows
Peak Risk on ‚ÄòAltseason Mania‚Äô
is defined where the capital flows into both Ethereum and Stablecoins is positive and increasing.
Live Advanced Workbench
For a sanity check, we can compare this indicator to the 30-day change in Bitcoin Dominance where we note that peaks in this altcoin mania indicator also align with large reductions in Bitcoin Market Cap Dominance.
Live Advanced Workbench
As a final comparison, we can compare it to the Swissblock Altcoin Cycle Signal, where we can see similar peaks (value of 100) in the indicator aligned with capital rotation towards Ethereum and Stablecoins.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Liquidity continues to dry up across the digital assets as network settlement, Exchange interaction and capital flows reside at cycle lows, heavily underscoring the current acute apathy experienced by the market.
The Long-Term Holder cohort remains resolute as their supply continues to ascend to new ATHs whilst HODLer Growth remains robust, tightening the active tradeable supply.
Despite large fluctuations in valuation for Altcoins, a symptom of the prevailing low liquidity environment, our new Altcoin framework which simulates the waterfall effect of capital rotation suggests a Risk On regime is not in play, providing confluence to the lack of liquidity available to digital assets."

Capital rotation in digital asset markets occurs both between assets (as covered last week), but also internally as coins change hands and trade between investors.
We develop a tool utilizing the Realized Cap HODL waves to track the rotation of capital from longer-term investors to speculators (and back again).
We couple this with a second indicator designed from NUPL variants, with both indicators helping to map out where the market is relative to past distribution cycles.

The Week On-chain Dashboard.
Traditional equity and commodity markets tend to rely on
Market Cap
as the primary valuation tool for an asset. In digital asset markets, we have an alternative metric derived from on-chain data known as the
Realized Cap
(more in this report
).
The realized cap aggregates the acquisition cost for each unit in the supply at the time it last changed hands. This in turn offers superior signal, and a more reliable approximation of the capital invested in an asset.
In this edition, we will continue our exploration of the capital rotation theme in digital asset markets (see last weeks
WoC 41
). However this week, we will shift our focus internally, and review the process of how coins change hands within the Bitcoin holder-base as market cycles progress.
The chart below compares the market cap and realized cap for Bitcoin. Only during the deepest drawdowns of bear markets has the market cap dropped below the realized cap. Other than these extremely painful intervals, the majority of market history involves market cap trading above the realized cap, suggesting the market holds an unrealized profit in aggregate.
The market cap traded below the realized cap for a 6-month period in the second half of 2022, and has since recovered to a value of $524B, compared to a realized cap of $396B.
Live Advanced Workbench
The realized cap tends to plateau, or drawdown slightly during bear markets, as coins change hands and are revalued to lower acquisition prices. During this process, they gradually migrate towards longer-term investor wallets where they start to mature (remaining dormant for longer periods of time).
This trend can be illustrated via the
Realized HODL Waves,
showing shifts in wealth distribution by age cohort (as a percent of realized cap). This tool visualizes the shifting supply and demand forces in the market, as capital rotates between investors.
üîµ
During market uptrends
older coins are spent and transferred from long-term holders to newer investors
(warmer bands expand, cooler bands contract)
.
üî¥
During market downtrends
speculators lose interest and gradually transfer coins to longer-term holders
(cooler bands expand, warmer bands contract).
Currently, the market has reached an equilibrium between these two investor groups, with a slightly positive inflow of newer investors entering the market (demand side). This resembles the conditions seen in both 2016 and 2019, where the market was attempting to recover from a significant bear market drawdown.
Live Advanced Chart
We can also isolate individual age bands to identify groups that best correspond with capital rotation between short and long-term investors.
First will look at age bands which are generally insensitive to market cycles, which are typically coins dormant for at least 3-years. This can be justified by noting this cohort hold a relatively small (<5%) share of the total wealth held in Bitcoin. Most coins in this group fall into the 3y-5y range, suggesting they were acquired during the 2018-20 period.
Live Advanced Workbench
Next, we will consider the cycle-sensitive subset of longer-term investors whom were active during the 2020-23 cycle. These coins are aged 6m-3y old, and the holdings of this cohort historically reaches maximums and minimums aligned with bear market lows, and bull market highs, respectively.
The peak of capital held within in the 1-2 year age band üü¢ often aligns with the deepest points of a bear market when rates of accumulation by high conviction holders is highest, working to establish a market floor. Conversely, capital held by this cohort reaches a minimum near bull market tops, as they exert maximum distribution pressure and eventually overwhelm inflowing demand.
Live Advanced Workbench
Lastly, we look at the youngest age band cohorts attributed to short-term investors and speculators. These bands are more closely related to the inflow of demand, being the actively traded coins that have recently changed hands. These age bands move inversely to the 6m-3y cohort, swelling during uptrends (new buyers), and compressing during bear markets as interest and activity in the asset wanes.
We note that the <1-month cohort is particularly responsive, and is a suitable opposing counterpart to the 1y-2y band to approximate the 'middle' behaviour of these two groups.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can now synthesise this capital rotation process into two dominant cohorts which tend to drive the market:
Short-Term Indicator [<1 month]
üî¥ The realized capital or wealth portion moved in the last 30 days. This cohort corresponds closely to the demand side, including new investors deploying fresh capital into the market.
Long-Term Indicator [1-2 years]üîµ
This portion of the supply peaks during the bear market bottom formation phase. This cohort represents the long-term and price insensitive investors that accumulated during, and held throughout the bear market.
During bear markets, the long-term indicator swells and holds more than 15% of the BTC capital (and also trades well above the short-term indicator). This structure illustrates the dominance of accumulation/holding conviction in the market.
This dynamic ends when new capital flows into the market, providing exit liquidity for long-term holders, and pushing the short-term indicator higher (and above the long-term indicator). This pattern describes an expansion of buy side pressure as prices rally and attract attention in the bull market.
Live Advanced Workbench
To conclude this study, we can measure the difference between these two indicators (1y-2y minus <1m) to map out the market's current status based on the capital rotation between long-term (supply) and short-term (demand) players.
This
Inter-Cycle Capital Rotation Ratio
üü™ is displayed below, and is currently trading at a level of 13%, which is similar to levels seen in 2016 and 2019. This indicates that the Bitcoin supply remains strongly dominated by the HODLer cohort, with a super-majority of coins now being older than 6-months.
Live Advanced Workbench
Sizing Up Investor Pain
Now that we have mapped out ‚Äòtime‚Äô component of capital rotation, we will dedicate the second part of this report to modelling this across another dimension, being the financial pressure on existing investors. We will leverage on-chain cost basis models for three cohorts:
Short-Term Holders üî¥
Long-Term Holders üîµ
Market-wide üü†
As the spot price deviates meaningfully above or below each cohort‚Äôs average cost basis, we can consider this as a growing incentive to take profits, or panic sell when their position is underwater, respectively.
The chart below shows periods where the spot price trades below the cost basis of all three cohorts, depicting a zone of acute financial pain across the market.
Live Advanced Workbench
Another tool to quantify the unrealized losses is using the
Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)
metric. This tool will indicate when a particular cohort is holding unrealized losses (NUPL<0) or unrealized profits (NUPL>0) on average.
Both the wider market, and the Long-Term Holder NUPL are currently positive, indicating the average investor is in profit. For Short-Term Holders however, their cost basis sits at $27.8k, resulting in STH-NUPL trading just slightly above neutral. These active investors are near their break-even level, suggesting that he $28k level is an important decision point for the market.
Live Professional Workbench
In a similar manner to the Realized Cap HODL wave analysis above, we will again take the difference between the long-term and short-term NUPL metrics to compare the financial pressure (or profit incentive) between these cohorts.
This
NUPL Ratio
üü™ provides an insightful indicator for navigating market cycles based on the bias in the Existing Supply (Long-Term Investors) vs New Demand (Short-Term Investors) components. The
NUPL Ratio
has entered the -0.25 range in Q3 2023, which is similar again to the 2016 and 2019 periods, and typical of a bear market recovery phase.
Live Professional Workbench
Conclusion
In this report we expanded on the theme of capital rotation, however this time focused on the cons changing hands within the Bitcoin holder-base. We utilize the powerful set of tools available within the age bands of the Realized Cap, and isolated sub-groups thatbest describe capital rotation throughout the cycle.
By measuring the difference between the wealth held by long-term and short-term investors, we can model the ebb and flow of supply and demand forces. From this, we can see that the current market structure very much resembles the recovery phase from a major bear market, with similarities to both 2016 and 2019."

Bitcoin investors have seen their holdings appreciate meaningfully this week, with BTC rallying from a low of $27.1k to a high of $35.1k. This move started off with a convincing break of several important technical and on-chain pricing levels on the way, making for a noteworthy sign of strength.
A cluster of long-term simple moving averages of price are located around $28k, and have provided market resistance through September and October. After a month of the market grinding higher, the bulls found sufficient strength this week to convincingly break through the 111-day, 200-day, and 200-week averages.
Live Chart
Are Derivatives The Driver?
When significant market moves take place, analysts often consult derivatives data to establish if the move was driven by a leverage wash-out. First we will look at open interest in perpetual swap markets, which we consider in BTC terms to filter out the effects of coin price movement.
Open interest did decline by around 25k BTC on 17-Oct, which is a reduction of around 8.3%. This was followed by a second major leverage washout of 35k BTC on 23-Oct as the market rallied to new yearly highs of $35k. This leverage squeeze is now of a magnitude similar to the short-squeeze in January, and the long-squeeze in August.
Live Chart
Approximately $56M in short positions were liquidated when the rally kicked off on 17-Oct, and followed by an additional $125M on 23-Oct. This is a meaningful short liquidation volume within the context of 2023. It is again comparable to the $155M in short liquidations in January and the $220M in long positions closed in August.
Live Chart
We can inspect futures liquidation volumes another way by taking the 30-day sum of liquidated longs, shorts, and computing the net balance. We can see that most of 2023 (and indeed most history) is dominated by greater long liquidation volumes compared to shorts.
On net, the market has now seen more short volumes force-closed over the last 30-days. The chart below highlights these points of such 'short-dominance', which have historically coincided with local market extremes.
Live Chart
Of note is that funding rates and cash-and-carry basis in futures markets have remained relatively calm all things considered. 2023 has generally seen futures markets yield annualized rates in excess of 6%, which are greater than US treasury rates.
The sell-off in August cooled this long bias substantially, with perpetual funding rates dropping from 7.5%+ to +2.5%. Whilst funding rates have spiked during the short squeezes this week, is has remained relatively low, suggesting the rally may be only partially driven leveraged speculation.
Live Chart
Options markets however continue to be a destination for speculative capital. Open interest in call options has surged by $4.3B, expanding by 80% to reach over $9.7B in total. This suggests that traders and investors continue to use options markets as a preferred instrument for long exposure. This is a relatively new development in Bitcoin market structure, where options markets are now of a comparable scale to futures (
see WoC 32
).
Live Chart
Taking Out Key Cost Basis Levels
Not only did this week's rally clear several long term technical analysis price levels, it has also found footing above two important on-chain cost basis models. Analysts can consider these 'cost-basis' models in a similar light to technical levels in that they reflect zones of psychological importance, and thus an area where investor behaviour may shift.
In our recent Cointime Economics research developed alongside
ARK-Invest
, we established the True Market Mean Price as an ideal candidate for an average investor cost-basis model. This model is currently trading at $29.78k, and has historically, seen the Bitcoin market trade half its time above, and half below this level.
With the market having cleared the 2020-22 cycle mid-point (see
WoC 28
), as well as trading above the True Market Mean Price, this puts the average active BTC investor back into an unrealized profit.

We can see instances in 2021-22 where STH-MVRV reached relatively deep corrections of -20% or more. Whilst the August sell-off did reach a low of -10%, it is noteworthy how shallow this MVRV decline is by comparison, suggesting the recent correction found noteworthy support, being a precursor to this weeks rally.
Live Chart
Whilst MVRV describes the profitability of coins held by Short-Term Holders (unspent supply), it has a sibling indicator called SOPR which describes the profitability of coins that were spent by STHs (spent supply).
We can similarly compute a 'Spent Cost Basis', to ascertain the average acquisition price for the coins transacted by the STH cohort. In other words, we are assessing the price that spent coins 'came from'.
We see a similar pattern to MVRV, with a relatively shallow SOPR drawdown compared to 2021-22, and a swing back into positive territory this week. This suggests that investors did not express the same degree of panic and fear as they did in the 2022 bear market proper, another sign of investor resilience.
Live Chart
If we bring these two cost basis models together, we can establish an oscillator that tracks the trend of Short-Term Holder confidence (explored further in
WoC 38
).
What we can see is that after hitting the most negative value since January (when prices were ~$16k), investor confidence has recovered to neutral, meaning STHs who are spending have a similar cost basis to those who are HODLing. We are also on the verge of a positive cross-over of these cost basis models.
Live Chart
How Did Long-Term Investors React?
The final question we will address is how longer-term investors have reacted to this rally, and how their aggregate positioning has changed.
With the market approaching YTD highs, a significant proportion of the supply has now recovered from being held 'in-loss' to 'in-profit'. The percent of supply in profit jumped by a massive 4.7M BTC, equivalent to 24% of the total circulating supply. This provides insight into the volume of coins which changed hands, and have a cost basis between $27k and $35k.
With 81% of the supply now in profit, the market has now returned to positive gear, with this metric now being above the long-term average for this metric (shown in green).
Live Chart
For the Long-Term Holder cohort, they appear impressively unaffected by this weeks rally, seeing their aggregate holdings break to a new all-time-high of 14.899M BTC. The continued climb of this metric indicates that a larger volume of supply is maturing across the 155-day holding threshold than is being spent out of it.
Approximately 29.6% of LTH Supply is held at a loss, which is actually historically high for this metric given the strong market uptrend since the 2022 lows. This is similar to late 2015 and early 2019, and the March 2020 bottom.
This suggests that the LTH cohort may well be a more hardened and firm handed cohort compared to prior cycles.
Live Chart
Lastly, we will look at a Z-Score (2yr period) transformation of the Revived Supply metric. We are seeking periods where coins which have been held for longer than 1yr are spent at a statistically significant rate compared to the prior 2-yrs (half a halving cycle).
Periods of high expenditure (green) often correlate with maximum profit taking (uptrends) or panic selling (downtrends). However today, this metric suggests we remain within a regime of coin dormancy, with a negative z-score reading, indicative of minimal volumes of revived supply reacting to this week's events.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin prices have reached new yearly highs, breaking back above the mid-cycle price level of $30k, and accelerating to $35k. The market found sufficient strength to break above several important pricing levels including the 200-day average, 200-week average (both technical), True Market Mean Price, and Short-Term Holder cost basis (both on-chain).
A meaningful proportion of supply and investors now find themselves above the average break-even price, located around $28k. This sets the foundation for a resumption of the 2023 uptrend. At the very least, the market has crossed over several key levels where aggregate investor psychology is likely to be anchored, making the weeks that follow important to keep an eye on."

The digital asset market has posted impressive returns in 2023, with both BTC and ETH outperforming traditional assets like gold by 93% and 39%, respectively.
Market corrections for the two majors have been meaningfully shallower than previous cycles, suggesting a investor support and positive capital inflows are in play.
Our Altseason indicator has flagged the first meaningful appreciation against USD since the cycle peak. However it is important to note that this is within the context of Bitcoin dominance continuing to rise, with the BTC market cap rising by 110% YTD.

Bitcoin prices have rallied over +30% in recent weeks, driven in part by positive progress related to the various Bitcoin ETF applications which are sitting with the SEC for approval. Also of note is the relative performance of BTC and digital assets at large compared to traditional asset classes such as commodities, precious metals, equities and bonds.
In this edition, we will explore this impressive relative performance of digital assets through 2023. Thus far, both BTC and ETH have out-performed traditional assets significantly, whilst also experiencing shallower drawdowns compared to prior cycles.
Relative Resilience
The chart below compares BTC and ETH price in gold denomination, demonstrating performance compared to the traditional defensive store of value. BTC has appreciated +93% relative to gold in 2023, whilst ETH is up 39% in gold terms. This strong performance comes amidst increasing global uncertainty, which is likely catching the eye of many traditional investors.
Live Chart
We can see that on a rolling 30-day basis, BTC üüß  and ETH üü¶ returns have been tightly correlated throughout 2023. Both assets have experienced similar magnitude downswings, however Bitcoin has seen stronger performance during upswing periods.
We can also see the relative volatility of both digital assets exceeds that of Gold (in black), which is trading with smaller price moves in both directions.
Live Chart
The relative strength of digital assets can also be observed by assessing the deepest correction during a macro uptrend. Here we will assess this metric for ETH, as it enables us to see performance relative to USD (an external benchmark), but also compared to the market leader BTC (an internal benchmark).
We consider the cycle low for ETH/USD as being set in June 2022 following the collapse of 3AC, Celcius and LUNA-UST. Since then, the deepest ETH/USD correction (relative to the local high) has been -44%, set during the failure of FTX. Today, ETH is trading -26% below its 2023 high of $2,118, which is substantially stronger performance than the -60% or larger drawdowns seen in previous cycles.
Live Chart
Comparable strength is visible for BTC, with the deepest correction in 2023 being just -20.1%. The 2016-17 bull market saw regular corrections exceeding -25%, whilst 2019 pulled back from the July-2019 high or $14k by over -62%.
For assessing capital rotation within the digital asset market, a useful reference is to seek periods where ETH out-performs relative to BTC. The chart below shows the depth of the maximum drawdown of the ETH-BTC ratio, compared to the local high of the prevailing uptrend.
Prior cycles have seen ETH drawdown to depths of over -50% on a relative basis during the bear market recovery phase, with the current drawdown reaching -38%. Of particular interest is the duration of this trend, where ETH has depreciated against BTC for over 470-days thus far. This highlights an underlying trend between cycles, where BTC dominance increases over a longer duration in the hangover period after a bear market.
We can also use this tool to monitor for inflection points in the Risk-on vs Risk-off cycle that we touched on in
WoC 41
(and will revisit later in this edition).
Live Chart
The chart provides another perspective on relative performance, showing oscillators for the rolling Quarterly, Weekly and Weekly ROI of the ETH/BTC Ratio. A barcode indicator (in blue) then highlights periods where all three timeframes are signalling under-performance of ETH relative to BTC.
Here we can see that the recent weakness in the ETH/BTC Ratio is similar to that seen in May-July 2022, with the price ratio having reached the same level of 0.052.
Live Chart
Trends in Investor Sentiment
Diving deeper into Ethereum price models, we note that ETH is trading at $1,800, which is +22% above the Realized Price ($1,475). The Realized Price is often considered the average cost basis for all coins in the supply, priced at the time when they last transacted.
This suggests that the average ETH holder is holding a modest degree of profit, however it remains some distance below the extreme price levels often visited during bull market euphoria.
Live Chart
\
Another way to visualize shifts in investor profitability is via the MVRV Ratio, being the ratio between price and the Realized Price. In this instance, we compare the MVRV Ratio to its 180-day moving average as a tool to monitor trends.
Periods where the MVRV Ratio trades above this long-term mean indicate investor profitability is increasingly meaningfully, and is often a signal of a rising market. However, despite the positive market performance for ETH YTD, by this metric the market is still experiencing negative momentum. It seems that the hangover from the 2022 bear is still being slowly worked through.
Live Chart
Shifting Confidence
We can also leverage the relative performance of ETH investor profitability using the Investor Confidence in Trend indicator we developed in
WoC 38
. The aim is to gauge the tides of shifting sentiment for ethereum investors, constructed by looking at the deviation of the cost basis of two subgroups: holders and spenders.
üü•
Negative Sentiment
is when the cost basis of spenders is significantly
lower
than holders.
üü©
Positive Sentiment
is when the cost basis of the spenders is significantly
higher
than holders.
üüß
Transition Sentiment
is when the cost basis fluctuates close to the holders cost basis.
By this measure, the market is within a transitional zone, being positive, but of a relatively small magnitude.

Altseason In USD...but not in BTC
Building on the prior work conducted in the
WoC 41
, we are able to produce a new iteration for the Altcoin Indicator. In this model, we utilize the previously defined risk-on environment as our first condition, requiring capital inflows into BTC, ETH and Stablecoins. We supplement this with a second condition, being a positive momentum within the Total Altcoin Cap (total crypto cap excluding BTC, ETH and Stablecoins).
Here we look for periods where the aggregate valuation of the Altcoin sector is greater than its 30D SMA. This indictaor flashed positive on 20-Oct, preceding the explosive Bitcoin move from $29.5k to $35.0k.
Live Chart
This heightened level of confidence in digital assets is apparent when assessing the recent performance of the Total Altcoin Market Cap.
The local move upwards recorded a +21.3% increase in the sector valuation, with only six trading days registering a larger percentage change. This highlights a waterfall effect of investor capital, as rising Bitcoin dominance tends to inspire an uptick in altcoin valuations relative to fiat currencies.
Live Chart
However, it is important to recall that Bitcoin dominance is continuing to rise. On a relative basis, BTC now commands over 53% of the digital asset market valuation, with Ethereum, Altcoins at large, and stablecoins all seeing a relative decline in their dominance throughout 2023. Bitcoin dominance has increased from a cyclical low of 38% hit in late 2022.
Live Chart
To close out this perspective, we can compare the YTD increase of the Bitcoin vs Aggregate Altcoin market cap (excl Stablecoins). Bitcoin's market cap has increased by 110% in 2023 compared to Altcoins rising by am impressive, but relatively small 37%.
This highlights an interesting market dynamic, whereby the altcoin sector are outperforming fiat currencies and traditional assets like Gold, but are meaningfully under-performing Bitcoin.
Live Chart
Conclusion and Summary
The digital asset market has posted impressive returns in 2023, leaving the initial recovery phase, and moving once again into an uptrend. Market corrections in 2023 for market leaders BTC and ETH have been significantly shallower than in prior cycle uptrends, suggesting a level of investor support and positive capital inflows are taking place.
Across several indicators, including our developing Altcoin Indicator, we have seen the first substantial increase in altcoin sector market valuations since the last cycle peak. However, it is important to note that this performance is measured relative to fiat currencies, namely the USD. Within the digital asset realm, Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, leading to the BTC market cap increasing by over 110% YTD."

The Bitcoin supply is quite tight with several measures of supply such as Illiquid, HODLed, and Long-Term Holder Supply at historical highs.
The spending behavior of Short-Term Holders suggests a shift in market character has taken place now that the market has rallied above the key $30k level.
Analysis of investor cost basis for various cohorts suggests that this $30k level is an important zone of interest for the bulls, with an 'air-gap' between there and $33k.
The Bitcoin halving is estimated to be ~166-days away, and a spot ETF approval in the US is starting to look increasingly likely. As a result, BTC investor excitement and sentiment is on the ascent. Within this context, a key question for investors is how much of the Bitcoin supply is freely circulating, as opposed to held tightly in investor wallets.
In this edition, we will explore this question, focusing on the distribution of the Bitcoin supply from a macro lens. We will use a variety of on-chain heuristics and metrics to gauge the tightness of the BTC supply.

Price performance of digital assets has been impressive YTD, which as we covered last week (

The Illiquid Supply metric, which measures the amount of supply held in wallets with minimal history of spending is also at an ATH of 15.4M BTC. Changes in Illiquid Supply often move in tandem with exchange withdrawals, suggesting investors continue to withdraw their coins into custody, with over 1.7M BTC doing so since May 2021.
Live Professional Chart
This is reflected in the monthly rate of change for Illiquid Supply which is within a multi-year period of net increase, currently increasing at a rate of +71k BTC per month.
Live Professional Chart
We see a similar pattern within the HODLer Net Position Change metric (also known as Vaulted Supply within the
Cointime Economics framework
). Vaulted Supply has experienced a sustained regime of inflows since June 2021, however with a notable uptick following the June 2022 sell-off when 3AC and LUNA-UST collapsed.
This metric speaks to an aggregate maturation of the BTC supply, as investors accumulate and hold onto their coins, refraining from spending and transacting at an increasing rate.
Live Advanced Chart
A Divergence of Conviction
A powerful divergence continues to form between Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply üîµ, which is just shy of an all-time-high, and Short-Term Holder (STH) supply üî¥ which is at effectively all-time-lows. This insightful dynamic demonstrates a growing tightness within the BTC supply, as existing holders become increasingly unwilling to part with their holdings.
As we covered in our
prior report
, LTHs historically wait for the market to break to new price ATH before ramping up their distribution. This process can be seen by the large scale decline in their supply during the 2021 bull run, which is matched by an uptick in STH Supply, as well as Exchange inflow volumes.
Live Advanced Workbench
If we take a ratio between Long and Short-Term Holder supply, we can see that it has broken out to new highs since July 2023. This clearly shows the magnitude of the divergence between dormant and mobile supply, and highlights an impressive tightness.
Live Advanced Workbench
The Activity-to-Vaulting Ratio (A2VR) is a new metric which elegantly describes this divergence at a macro scale. It compares the all-time balance of coin 'activity' and 'inactivity‚Äô measured through units of investor holding time (usually coin-days or coin-blocks).
Uptrends
indicate that investors with old coins are spending, with steeper ascents indicating aggressive distribution.
Downtrends
indicate that investors prefer to hold their coins in an inactive state, with steeper trends suggesting an acceleration of this behavior.
The A2VR metric has been within a downtrend since June 2021, with the gradient steepening meaningfully after June 2022. This metric has now reached similar lows to that in early 2019 and late 2020, both preceding significant market uptrends. This also suggests that the ‚Äòexuberance‚Äô of the 2021-22 cycle has been completely flushed from the market.
üï∞Ô∏è

Another lens to assess investor activity is via analysis of their spending behaviors. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a great tool to evaluate the absolute value of profit or loss locked in by investors in relation to the size of the asset (measured as the Realized Cap). We consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors in aggregate are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis.
Low values
indicate that the majority of coins being spent are close to break even, suggesting an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô at the current price range.
In this instance, we consider only the Short-Term Holder cohort as they are one of the primary drivers of day-to-day price action. Following the recent rally to $35k, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio spiked from historical lows, suggesting a ‚Äòre-awakening‚Äô of many young coins. This speaks to a near-term profit taking event by this cohort.
Live Professional Workbench
For the Long-Term Holder cohort however, their Sell-Side Risk ratio has increased slightly, yet remains extremely low in a historical context. This metric currently has a similar structure to the 2016 and late 2020 eras, which were similar periods of tight overall BTC supply.
Live Professional Workbench
Accumulation Across The Board
The prior set of metrics largely consider the Bitcoin supply in terms of the aggregate ageing and maturing of coins. Another lens is to consider the supply from the context of wallet sizes. The Accumulation Trend Score metric helps track supply based on entity size, and an unusual dynamic has emerged since late October.
Here we can see a near perfect inflow score üü¶across all cohorts, certainly the most stark example YTD. We can see a pattern where the market has met resistance during periods of increased net outflows üü• across the majority of cohorts, whilst market upticks are met with a general trend of balanced inflows üü¶. This phenomenon appears to speak to a growing investor confidence and an inflection in participant behavior.
Live Chartin Glassnode Engine Room
If we isolate only entities on the smaller end of the scale such as Shrimps (<1 BTC), Crabs (1-10 BTC) and Fish (10-100 BTC), we can see their accumulation pattern is quite significant. The combined rate of balance increase for this sub-group is currently equivalent to 92% of newly mined supply, and has remained in an elevated state since May 2022.
Live Professional Workbench
Cost Basis Clusters
To conclude, we can use the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) to identify areas of densely concentrated cost basis, as well as airgap price zones where relatively few coins have transacted. We can see four areas of interest within close proximity to our current spot price.
Section A: A large cluster of supply was accumulated between $26k and $31k through Q2 and Q3 of 2023.
Section B: An airgap is be noted between $31k and $33k, with price having passed through here quickly.
Section C: A significance amount of supply has recently transacted within the current price range between $33k and $35k.
Section D: Approximately 620k BTC from the 2021-22 cycle have a cost basis just above between $35k and $40k.
Live Professional Chart
Finally, we can add color to this URPD distribution by splitting into Long-Term üîµ and Short-Term üî¥ Holders. We note that the majority of STH coins are now profitable, with the majority sporting a cost basis between $25k and $30k. The uptick in the STH Sell-Side Risk Ratio from earlier aligns with the ‚Äòprofit-taking‚Äô event which transferred coins to new investors at the current price range.
Overall, this suggests that the $30k to $31k range is a key area of interest, being the upper level of the largest supply and cost basis cluster. Given relatively few coins transacted on the road from to $35k, this makes the market reaction in the event price returns to $30k of interest. It would also align with the True Market Mean Price we presented in
WoC 44
being our best estimate of the average ‚Äòactive investor cost basis‚Äô.

Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin supply is historically tight with many supply metrics describing 'coin inactivity' reaching multi-year, and even all-time highs. This suggests that the BTC supply is extremely tightly held, which is impressive given the strong price performance YTD. With the halving expected in April, and positive momentum around a spot ETF in the US, the coming months are shaping up to be exciting ones for Bitcoin investors."

With the fourth Bitcoin halving fast approaching, estimated in April 2024, a tightness is forming within the Bitcoin supply which has reached historical levels.
We assess a variety of measures for both 'available supply', as well as rates of 'supply storage' by longer-term investors which exceeds new issuance by 200%+.
Using a relationship between Market Cap and Realized Cap, we estimate this supply tightness results in capital inflows into BTC is having an outsized impact on valuation.

Assessing Supply Dynamics Into the 2024 Bitcoin Halving
The halving event is one of the most anticipated events on the Bitcoin calendar, occurring every 210,000 blocks, and cutting the rate of new coin issuance by 50%. Whilst the fourth halving is pre-determined to occur at block-height 840,000, the exact date and time is unknown due to the natural variability and probabilistic nature of mining blocks.
Our best estimate given the current average block interval is that the halving is 158-days away, expected on the 23-April-2024.
Live Advanced Chart
Given the high CAPEX and OPEX demands of mining, Bitcoin miners have historically distributed a majority of their BTC income to cover costs. The YTD high of USD value issued to miners via newly minted supply is ~$1B/month, which is a non-trivial capital inflow headwind.
In a post 2024 halving world, this would be cut to $500M/month, which is comparable with the $450M/month distribution pressure around the FTX lows, set one year ago.

Aside from the technical elegance and unstoppable nature of the Bitcoin halving, it is also a point of interest for investors. All prior halvings have experiencing impressive market performance in the 365-days that followed.
This naturally creates a point of intrigue as to whether the halving is the primary driver of these price appreciation cycles, or merely one of many factors. In this edition we will explore this through the lens of supply and investor behavior patterns to add some colour to the debate from an on-chain perspective.
We will break this into three analysis stages:
Assessing the 'Available and Active' Supply
Measuring rates of 'Supply Storage and Saving'

Live Advanced Chart
Assessing Available Supply
Our first port of call is to establish an estimate of the volume of BTC which is mobile, active, and freely circulating. In other words, what is the available supply that investors can reasonably expect to change hands in the near term?
The chart below covers several supply heuristics using 'coin-age' as the main input, measuring the time since a coin was last spent on-chain. Short-Term Holder Supply is currently at multi-year lows of 2.33M BTC, and captures coins up to 155-days old that are statistically the most likely to be spent.
Other metrics which describe 'hotter' supply include coins younger than 1-month (1.39M BTC), but could also consider Futures Open Interest (0.41M BTC BTC) as a form of 'supply exposure' in derivative markets.
Combined, this 'hot supply' volume is equivalent to between 5% and 10% of the circulating supply which is participating in day-to-day trade.
Live Professional Chart
Glassnode developed another supply heuristic that monitors the spending behavior of wallets, classified into Illiquid, Liquid and Highly Liquid buckets. The latter two are shown below which represent wallets that both receive coins and also spend a significant proportion of them.
Of note is the multi-year decline that started in March 2020 when the world experienced a seismic shift brought on by the pandemic and social response to it.
Live Professional Chart
There is significant overlap between Liquid and Highly Liquid supply and Exchange Balances for obvious reasons. This multi-year downtrend is visible again, suggesting coins are moving out of Exchange wallets and towards more Illiquid wallets with little history of spending.
Live Professional Chart
An important nuance of this is the role of both institutional grade custodians, and ETF style products like GBTC (a useful reference for any future spot ETF vehicles). The chart below shows our best estimate of aggregate on-chain volumes for our Coinbase Exchange, Coinbase Custody, and GBTC clusters.
Note again the March 2020 turning point where demand for both GBTC and custody products increased significantly, both of which will classify as Illiquid supply in many instances.
If we compare Short-Term Holder Supply and Exchange Balances, we can see they are of a similar magnitude of around 2.3M BTC. Combined, these two measures of 'available supply' equate to 23.8% of the circulating supply, which is now at an all-time-low.
It could be argued that this puts available BTC supply at historical lows on a relative basis.
Live Advanced Chart
Measuring Rates of Stored and Saved Supply
We have established that the general trend for various measures of 'available supply' is declining. This trend is now a few years old, but has notably accelerated since the market wide sell-off in June 2022 (LUNA-UST and 3AC).
Live Professional Chart
By contrast, when we overlay the inverse measures of 'saved or stored' supply, we can see a remarkable divergence is forming. Here we consider 'stored supply' using the following heuristics:
Long-Term Holder Supply (Coins older than -155-days, dark blue)
Illiquid Supply (wallets with limited spending history, light blue)
Vaulted Supply (deep HODLed and Lost supply, see Cointime Economics, green)
This divergence is meaningful in that it suggests coins are generally migrating away from Exchange balances, speculators, and active trade, and towards cold storage, custody, and wallets of longer-term investors.
Live Professional Chart
To get a sense of scale, we can compare the rate at which coins are being stored and saved relative to new issuance. At present, approximately 81k BTC are mined each quarter which will soon decrease to ~40.5k BTC/qtr after the halving.
If we overlay the 90-day change in Illiquid Supply, we can see there has been a sustained uptick in illiquid balances through all prior halving events. This suggests investor buy-side tends to ramp up in the lead up to and through the halving, often significantly exceeding the rate of issuance both before and after the event.
Illiquid Supply is currently increasing at a rate of 180k BTC/qtr which is 2.2x more than issuance.
Live Professional Chart
Through the lens of 'stored supply' using investor holding time as the input, we see a similar accumulation pattern for Long-Term Holders (blue) and Vaulted Supply (green). Interestingly, this investor behavior seems to come in three waves:
Wave 1 during the middle of the bear
as prices correct sharply from the ATH.
Wave 2 during later stages of the bear
as the cycle floor is established.
Wave 3 leading into and through the halving
as investors acquire in anticipation.

Accumulation rates can also be assessed using wallet size heuristics, where this chart considers all entities holding less than 100 BTC. These Shrimp (< 1BTC), Crabs (1 to 10BTC) and Fish (10 to 100BTC) capture a wide cross section of investors, from retail through to high net worth individuals.
In aggregate, their accumulation rates have exceeded new issuance since Feb 2022, being the longest and most sustained period in history.

To summarise, the chart below shows the net balance change of these various 'stored' supply metrics since 1-Jan-2022. We use the change in circulating supply (orange) as our baseline, and see that the rates of accumulation by investors ranges from between 1.1x through to almost 2.5x new issuance.
Not only are our measures of 'available supply' at historical lows, the rates of 'supply storage' by investors are also meaningfully higher than issuance rates in a pre-halving environment. The cyclical nature of Bitcoin market cycles duirng bear markets and halving events can be described by these investor accumulation patterns, reminding us of a saying in markets;

Analysing Shifting Capital Tides
In several recent WoC editions, we have focused on the rotation of capital throughout the digital asset ecosystem (see WoC
41
,
42
, and
44
). In these editions, we use The Realized Cap as a proxy for capital inflows, outflows and rotation between assets.
At a behavioral level, long-term investors in Bitcoin tend to buy low and sell high, a process which realizes profit, and revalues coins from a low cost basis to a higher one. A coin acquired at $6k in 2018 is sold at $60k in 2021, requiring 900% more capital to flow in and acquire the same coin volume.
An important aside: whilst 'stored supply' is increasing today, the chart below is showing the inverse, where profits are taken, and 'stored supply' is spent back into liquid circulation.

In late stage bull markets (orange zones) more than $0.75, and often over $1.0 in capital inflows is needed to achieve a $1.0 Market Cap change. This has histrionically been found to be a unsustainable condition.
During bear markets, as capital and investor attention drains, this can drop to between $0.10 and $0.30. This leads to more volatile price swings, as small capital inflows or outflows result in an outsized impact.
This metric is close to the long-term median (in red) of $0.25, suggesting Bitcoin supply and liquidity is fairly tight. A capital inflow/outflow of $0.25 is creating a $1.0 change in the market cap. In many ways, this aligns with the supply dynamics discussed above, where 'available supply' is indeed historically low, storage rates are up, and liquidity is thinner as a result.

Summary and Conclusions
The fourth halving event is fast approaching and represents an important fundamental, technical, and philosophical milestone for Bitcoin. For investors, it is also an area of intrigue given the impressive return profile in prior cycles.
In this edition we explored the tightness forming within the Bitcoin supply using a variety of  supply measures and heuristics. There is notable confluence between these metrics suggesting 'available supply' is at historical lows, and rates of 'supply storage' exceed current issuance by a factor of up to 2.4x."

As the market trades at yearly highs, over 83.6% of the Bitcoin coin supply are now held in profit, being the highest level since November 2021 (near the ATH).
However, the magnitude of unrealized profit held, measured as the delta between spot price and the coins cost basis, remains modest.
The degree of unrealized profit held by investors is thus far an insufficient incentive to motivate long-term holder to spend, keeping the overall supply relatively tight.

Bitcoin continues its strong price performance, trading near year to date highs and pushing over $37.9k this week. As a result, over 16.366M BTC are now held in profit, equivalent to 83.6% of the Circulating Supply. This puts the coin volume in profit at levels similar to the 2021 bull market highs.
In this edition, we will explore what this means for investor profitability, and how it compares to past bull market conditions.

Accumulation Across the Board
We will start with a view on investor accumulation behavior, considering the balance change of on-chain wallets. Using the
Accumulation Trend Score,
we can illustrate how this most recent rally is seeing greater accumulation patterns than others this year.
Unlike the first two rallies of 2023, this indicator is signalling a robust accumulation regime (dark colors) during recent price expansion, supporting the price spiking +39% over the last 30 days.

Chart Tip:
This metric applies a 7-day Simple Moving Average to smooth between each daily data point, and improve visualisation.

Considering different wallet sizes, a more detailed assessment can break down this accumulation score by cohorts. A distinct shift has occurred since late October, where investors of all wallet sizes have seen a substantial uptick in their holdings (denoted in üü¶).
We can see that conditions throughout 2023 have seen net outflows üü• across several cohorts, suggesting a non-uniform behavior by different investor cohorts. This broad uptick in accumulation means that strong market performance and increasingly optimistic hopes around a spot BTC ETF are improving investor confidence in the uptrend.

A Profitable Rally
With price retesting yearly highs, the percentage of the supply held in profit has reached 83% of the total circulating supply. From a statistical standpoint, this is historically significant, being well above the all-time mean value (74%) and pushing towards the higher band of +1 standard deviation 90%.
When this indicator trades above this upper band, it has historically aligned with the market entering the early stages of a bull market's ""

To put the current supply profitability into perspective, the chart below highlights three typical cycle phases over the last 5 years.
Bottom Discovery
üü• where less than 58% (-1 std) of circulating coins are in profit.
Bear/Bull Transition
üü® where the market is recovering from the Bottom Discovery phase (or falling from Euphoria) by trading within 58% of supply in profit and 90%.
Euphoria
üü© where most coins are in profit as the price is reaching the last ATH (+1 std).
The market has been within the Bear/Bull Transition phase for the past 10 months, as it recovered from the 2022 bear trend. The majority of 2023 has traded below the all-time average, with the October rally being the first sustained break above.
Live Advanced Workbench
Volume vs Magnitude
It is important to note that the prior charts measured the coin volume held in profit, being coins with a cost basis lower than the spot price. This, however, is different from the magnitude of unrealized profit held, which assesses the delta between the cost basis and the current rate.
For the analysis of investor behavior, often the unrealized profit is a more critical variable as it relates back to the USD-denominated profit of investor positions.
The next chart applies the same mean and ¬±1 std bands to the
Unrealized Profit
indicator. From this, we can directly measure the magnitude of profit held by investors. This metric shows, on average, how much profit is stored in the market for every dollar worth of bitcoin.
Unlike the prior coin volume metrics, the magnitude of
Unrealized Profit
has not yet reached a statistically high level coincident with the heated stages of the bull market. It is currently trading at the all-time mean level of 49%, significantly lower than the extreme levels of 60%+ seen in the euphoria phase of past bull markets.
This suggests that whilst a significant volume of the supply is in profit, most have a cost basis, which is only moderately below the current spot price.
Live Advanced Workbench
A Strong Divergence
Another remarkable phenomena is the increasing divergence between the supply held by long-term holders and short-term holders.
As discussed in
WOC 45
, Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply üîµ has been continuously hitting new all-time highs since November 2022, reaching 14.9M BTC at the time of writing. Conversely, Short-Term Holder (STH) supply üî¥ has declined to 2.3M BTC, which is effectively a new all-time low.
This dynamic indicates the existing holders have become increasingly unwilling to part with their holdings, as they historically wait for the market to break to a new price ATH (
see our prior report
). This can be interpreted as investors requiring a higher unrealized profit (magnitude) before ramping up their distribution pressure.
Live Advanced Workbench
The Road Ahead
We have now established that market profitability is slightly above its statistical midpoint. Next, we will explore how these tools can provide a macro blueprint of the road ahead based on prior cycles.
The first tool focuses on the supply held in Profit/Loss held by Long-Term Holders (LTH). We note that Long-Term Supply tends to be quite cyclical, and we have highlighted various regimes of strong spending üî¥ and strong holding üü¢ patterns on the chart below.
Before reclaiming the ATH, LTH supply goes through a lengthy re-accumulation period, with a generally flat to modest rise in aggregate supply held.
As the market breaks the previous cycle ATH, the incentive to ramp up spending increases significantly. This results in a dramatic decline in LTH supply, transferring coins to newer buyers at increasingly expensive prices.
Throughout the 2022 bear market, the first phase has played out very consistent with past cycles, with LTH supply climbing strongly. This shows a remarkable resilience of BTC holders, despite growing losses held by this cohort last year. However, unlike the 2015-26 and 2018-20 cycles, there have been fewer dips and oscillations due to spending, with LTH supply tending to push higher and higher. This speaks to a degree of supply tightness which we covered in
WoC 45
and
WoC 46
.

Chart Tip:
This chart isolates Long-Term Holders by turning off two traces associated with Short-Term Holders (by clicking the legend items).

Using these observations, we revisit a compass we introduced in
WoC 22
, which gauges spending behavior by LTHs. This tool helps to break the long and rocky road between bear market lows and the new ATHs into three sub-intervals:
Bottom Discovery
üü• where price trades below the LTH Cost Basis.
Equilibrium
üüß where price trades above the LTH Cost Basis but below the previous ATH.
Price Discovery

Workbench Tip:
AND conditionals can be setup in workbench by multiplying two or more if-then statements, where TRUE = 1.
Live Advanced Workbench
To wrap up, we can merge the SBI indicator and the relative position of the spot price, and LTH cost basis to construct a new tool for tracking market sentiment. We consider four sub-categories for spotting shifts in LTH divestment:
Capitulation
üü• where spot price is lower than the LTH cost basis, and therefore, any strong spending¬†is likely due to financial pressure and capitulation
(Conditions: LTH-MVRV < 1 and SBI > 0.55).
Transition
üüß where price trades slightly above the long-term holders' cost basis, and occasional light spending is part of day-to-day activity
(Conditions: 1.0 < LTH-MVRV < 1.5¬†and SBI > 0.55)
.
Equilibrium
üü® after recovering from a prolonged bear, the market seeks a new balance between a light in-flow demand, lighter liquidity, and underwater holders from the previous cycle. Strong LTH spending during this stage is usually associated with sudden rallies or corrections (Conditions: 1.5 < LTH-MVRV < 3.5
and SBI > 0.55
).
Euphoria
üü© as LTH-MVRV reaches 3.5 (historically aligned with the market hitting the prior ATH), LTHs are holding upwards of 250% profit on average. The market enters a euphoria phase, which motivates these investors to spend at very high, and accelerating rates (Conditions:¬†LTH-MVRV > 3.5 and
SBI > 0.55
).
Following the recent rally above $37.1k (LTH at >50% profit), the market experienced an uptick in LTH‚Äôs spending, flagging the first intensive cash out by these players via the ""

Conclusion
With the recent price rally, the volume of coins in profit has reached the levels that last was seen 2 years ago as the market came off the Nov 2021 ATH. However, the magnitude of unrealized profit held within these coins remains modest, and thus far insufficient to motivate long-term holders to lock in profits."
2023,48,2023-W48,2023-11-27,2023-12-03,Bullish,37241.63,39984.81,38406.19,7.37,Agree,"Executive Summary
The Ethereum staking pool has experienced a significant trend change marked by an increasing amount of validators exiting since October. This development correlates with a broader bullish uptrend across digital asset markets.
The increased number of validator exits has contributed to a decline in daily ETH issuance, which is related to the amount of active ETH within the staking pool.
Simultaneously, we have seen increased network activity, driven by renewed interest in tokens and stablecoins. This is reflected by an increase in gas fees being burnt via EIP1559 triggering a deflationary turn the ETH supply.
Undoubtedly, the most significant headline of the past week was the resignation of Binance CEO CZ. The settlement amount reached with the authorities stands at $4.3 billion, with many seeing this pivotal event as a marker for the end of the 'wild-west' years of the digital asset industry.
Following this announcement, the price of BNB experienced a -9.1% decline. However, this market reaction is relatively moderate when compared to previous price drops, such as the -24% fall when the SEC announced charges earlier in the year.
Live Chart
Following this news, the Binance exchange experienced an uptick in withdrawal activity across major assets. The aggregate balance of a range of DeFi 'blue-chips' decreased by -6.7% within the first 24 hours, while BTC, ETH and Stablecoin balances declined by -4.4%, -4.9% and -2.2%, respectively.
However, in the six days following CZ's resignation, these exchange balances saw a recovery, with all four token categories seeing a slowdown of outflows, and indeed a return to net inflows. In many ways this demonstrates a level of trust users have in the Binance platform. It could also be argued that confidence may even improve given the settlement requirement for US regulator oversight over the next three years.
Live Chart
Validator Exits
While not capturing the same headlines as the Binance settlement, the Ethereum staking pool has has experienced a notable shift since the start of October. An increasing number of validators are currently exiting the staking pool.
Shanghai enabled stake withdrawals, and was followed by a surge in validators exiting, claiming rewards, and reshuffling their staking provider and setup. Exiting events averaged 309 validators per day during this time.
Since early October, we have seen a gradual increase in exiting events, reaching an average of 1018 validators per day. This uptick aligns with the recent uptrend in spot prices across digital asset markets.
Live Workbench Chart
Consequently, the Total Effective Balance, representing the ETH in the Staking Pool, that is actively participating in Proof-of-Stake Consensus, has slowed in its growth and is now experiencing the first decline since the Shanghai upgrade.
The gradient of the Total Effective Balance began to flatten out in mid-October, registering an average increase of 0.1% to 1% per day, more than halving the growth rate sustained since May.
Live Chart
Upon closer examination of exiting validators, we can see it is largely driven by voluntary exits over the past eight weeks. Voluntary exits refer to stakers who independently choose to exit the staking pool. This is distinct from slashing, which is a penalty applied to validators which violate protocol rules.
In the same timeframe, only two slashing events have occurred, one of which was substantial, involving 100 newly-entered validators, slashed for simultaneously signing two different blocks of the network.

Live Workbench Chart
Exiting validators can be further categorized by the staker type they belong to. This reveals a few interesting trends:
Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have consistently dominated stake withdrawal events since October, with Kraken and Coinbase seeing the largest outflows.
Liquid Staking Providers have also experienced a modest uptick in withdrawn stake as well, with Lido remaining the largest player in the space.
There are a few points which may be driving this investor behavior:
Investors opting to change their staking setup, for example transferring stake from CEXs to Liquid Staking Providers (perhaps due to ongoing regulatory concerns).
Investors with access to US capital markets may be rotating capital towards safer assets such as US treasuries as interest rates remain elevated relative to ETH staking returns.
Investors may also be seeking greater liquidity for held ETH in anticipation of an imminent market uptrend, rather than less liquid staked ETH.
Kraken and Coinbase stand out as top providers seeing withdrawals, while Lido leads in exits among Liquid Staking Providers. However, these same entities, with Lido taking the lead, are also the primary recipients of stake deposits, showing a net stickiness and dominance of these large pools of capital.
Live Chart
On a net change basis, Lido continues to grow in dominance, increasing its aggregate staked balance by 468k ETH. Across CEXs, Coinbase and Binance have seen a net increase in their staking balances, whilst Kraken has reduced its stake balance by -19.4k ETH. Among staking providers, HTX and Staked.us exhibit the most significant reduction in their staking balances, each decreasing by over ETH -44k.
Live Chart
Aligned with the observed reduction in Effective Balance, there has been a corresponding decrease in ETH issuance. The daily issuance of ETH to validators is contingent on the number of Active Validators, or respectively, the Total Effective Balance within the staking pool.
As the growth rate of validators slows and declines, the daily ETH issuance has experienced a corresponding slowdown. Over the last 7-days, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day. Notably, the rate of issuance has decreased for the first time in recent days.
Live Chart
As issuance rates experience a decline, we now turn our attention to the complementary aspect of the equation‚Äîthe burn rate. Initiated with the London hardfork in 2021, the fee-burning mechanism of EIP1559 involves the burning of a portion of transaction fees, setting the stage for the ETH supply to become deflationary with elevated network usage.
In tandem with rising gas prices, which signify growing transaction demand on the Ethereum network, the daily amount of ETH fees burned has increased as well. In October, we see the amount of ETH fees being burnt reaching 899 ETH per day. Fast forward almost one month, and the accumulated fees burnt has now reached 5,368 ETH.
üìä
Related Dashboard:
We deep dive into the complex ETH Supply Dynamice in our dashboard
ETH Supply and Issuance
.
Live Chart
We can also assess a detailed breakdown of gas usage across various transaction types. These metrics enable us to identify activities that predominantly contribute to the supply burn.
Upon examining the two sectors that historically fuelled Ethereum network adoption, it becomes evident that both NFT transactions and DeFi transactions are contributing relatively little over the past four months, with decreases of -3% and -57%, respectively. Both sectors have seen declining adoption and are contributing little to the latest surge in activity on-chain.
Live Chart
The recent surge in network activities is primarily attributed to token transfers and stablecoins. Gas usage for tokens has risen by +8.2% over the last three months, whilst stablecoin gas usage has increased by +19%. This suggests a potential light capital rotation is taking place towards longer-tail assets as confidence in market strength increases.
Live Chart
Since the London hardfork, the ETH transitioned from net inflationary towards a state of equilibrium and outright or deflation. The network experienced a brief period of net inflation between August and October as a result of lower network activity.
In recent weeks, as a result of both declining issuance rates, and larger volumes of supply burnt, the aggregate ETH supply has turned net deflationary once again.
Live Workbench Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Recent weeks have seen a notable shift in the Ethereum staking pool dynamics, as the number of validators exiting the pool starts to increase. This has resulted in a slowdown of the growth rate for ETH issuance, and the first reducion in the staking pool balance since the Shanghai upgrade.
Furthermore, a recent surge in network activities, particularly driven by token transfers and stablecoins, has led to elevated transaction demand. This has in turn put upwards pressure on gas prices, creating an increase in daily ETH fees burned via EIP1559.
These two forces in combination have resulted in the global ETH supply turning deflationary once again. In this context, the interplay of these factors underscores the dynamic nature of the Ethereum network, supply and its responsiveness to trends in market activity and adoption."

This is on the basis of a very broad spectrum of metrics which signalled that this was the zenith in market sentiment, adoption rates, and investor confidence (see

Another framework for considering the relative strength of this uptrend is to measure the depth of pullbacks from the most recent local high. The deepest correction in 2023 has been a remarkably shallow -20.1%, standing out as the shallowest of any historical macro uptrend.
The 2016-17 bull market saw regular corrections exceeding -25%, whilst 2019 pulled back from the July-2019 high of $14k by over -62%. This suggests a level of underlying demand support in 2023 which aligns with the increasingly tight supply dynamics we covered in

An Uptick in Exchange Activity
Following periods of impressive performance, it becomes prudent to monitor transactions related to Exchanges, seeking any notable deviations in activity or capital flows. Despite a strong year thus far, the number of transactions depositing funds to Exchanges continues to plummet to multi-year lows, making for a counter intuitive observation.
Live Chart
However, unlike prior cycles, we must now consider transaction counts within the context of a new buyer of blockspace: Inscriptions. Since each Bitcoin block has a constrained block-space data limit, periods where Inscriptions are paying higher fees can ‚Äòprice out‚Äô exchange deposits which are paying lower fees.
If we look at Exchange Deposits as a percentage of all transactions üü†, it would suggest they have dropped from around 26% in May to just 10% today. However if we adjust for Inscriptions, comparing deposits only to non-inscription transactions üîµ, we see the decline is more modest to around 20%.
This suggests that Inscriptions are currently willing to pay a higher priority fee than Exchange related deposits.
Live Chart
Looking at this from the on-chain volume domain, we can see that YTD flows in and out of Exchanges has grown considerably from $930M to over $3B (+220%). This underscores an expanding interest from investors to trade, accumulate, speculate and otherwise utilze exchanges for their services.
Live Chart
With a such a large uptick in Exchange volumes, an interesting observation emerges from analysis of the average size of a deposits to Exchanges. This metric has experienced a non-trivial rally, climbing just shy of the previous ATH of $30k per deposit.
From this it appears that exchange deposits are currently dominated by investors moving increasingly large sums of money. This is potentially a sign of growing institutional interest as key ETF decision dates approaches in January 2024.
Live Chart
Whilst the number of transactions to and from Exchanges is relatively low, volumes flowing in/out are responsible for 72.2% of all on-chain volume, on par with the previous ATH. This emphasizes how a substantial proportion of on-chain throughput is related to exchange activity, as investors deposit and withdraw in increasing size and volume.

Supply Moves into Profit
The 2023 rally has pushed Bitcoin‚Äôs price decisively above two key on-chain pricing levels:
The Realized Price in January, putting the average unit of BTC into profit (includes ancient and lost coins).
The True Market Mean Price in October, putting the average active investor back into profit.
With the market now trading meaningfully above the True Market Mean Price ($31.0k), the majority of Bitcoin holders will have seen their portfolios recover from the 2022 bear market. Historically this has signalled a constructive transition towards a more enthusiastic bull market.
üï∞Ô∏è
The True Market Mean Price was developed as part of our
Cointime Economics report
, covering a new framework for Bitcoin on-chain analytics.
Live Chart
From the perspective of Long-Term Holders, the YTD rally has seen the proportion of their holdings held in profit increase from 56% to 84%. This has broken above the all time average value of 81.6%.
Previous breakouts above this level have historically aligned with a transition towards strong up-trending markets, providing confluence with the above observation.
Live Chart
The Short-Term Holder cohort are almost entirely in profit, with over 95% of their holdings sporting a cost basis below the current spot price. This reading is above the long-term +1 standard deviation level for this metric, and is again historically associated with enthusiastic uptrends.
Live Chart
Marginal Profits Realized
Now that we have established that several cohorts of investors are back in profit, the next logical step is to assess if there are any discernible shifts in profit taking and spending by these cohorts. For this, we can employ the SOPR metric which provides a view into the average profit or loss multiple locked in.
Currently, several SOPR variants are trading above 1.0, suggesting the average spent coin is locking in a profit across many cohorts:
üü† Wider Market: SOPR = 1.09 (+9% profit on average)
üî¥ Short-Term Holders: STH-SOPR = 1.01 (+1% profit on average)
üîµ Long-Term Holders: LTH-SOPR = 1.46 (+46% profit on average)
üõ†Ô∏è
Workbench Tip:
Here we use an if-then conditional statement to highlight periods where all 3 variants of the SOPR metric are above the break-even level of 1.0.
Live Chart
We can extend this insight by monitoring the number of consecutive days where all three SOPR variants have traded above 1.0. The current rally has seen this condition persist for 44 days, which is longer than the average duration of 17 days, and is also the longest stretch since the Nov 2021 ATH.
Overall, this indicates that a super majority of Bitcoin holders are in profit, and sufficient demand is flowing in to absorb the distributed supply.
Live Chart
The net USD denominated realized profit locked in by the market has reached $324M/day, which remains an order of magnitude below the peaks experienced during the later stages of the 2021 bull market (which eclipsed $3B/day).
This suggests that whilst market performance is strong, and investors are enjoying meaningful profit, it remains very much within the bounds of an early rather than a late stage bull market.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin continues to lead as one of the best performing assets globally in 2023. Not only has BTC appreciated over 140% YTD, it has more than doubled relative to gold, and still dominates against the rest of the digital asset industry.
With such strong performance, the super-majority of Bitcoin holders are now back in profit, with a small proportion of them realizing those gains. Several on-chain metrics suggest the recent rally has pushing the market out of a 'transitional recovery zone', and now more closely resembles an 'enthusiastic bull market'."

The strong Bitcoin uptrend found resistance this week, breaking to a new yearly high of $44.5k before experiencing the third sharpest selling off of 2023.
Several on-chain pricing models suggest that 'fair value' based on investor cost basis and network throughput are lagging, hovering between $30k and $36k.

The Bitcoin market has performed a round-trip this week, opening at $40.2k, rallying to a new yearly high of $44.6k, before selling off sharply to $40.2k late on Sunday evening. The upside move into the yearly high consisted of two rallies over +5.0%/day (+1 standard deviation moves). The sell-off was equally as powerful, dropping by over $2.5k (-5.75%) making for the third largest one-day down move for 2023.
As we covered last week (

Navigating Cycles via On-chain Pricing Models
A useful toolset for navigating market cycles are investor cost basis, measured from the on-chain transactions for various cohorts. The first cost basis model metric we will consider is the
Active Investor Realized Price
üü†, which computes a
Fair Value
of Bitcoin based on our
Cointime Economics
framework.
This model applies a weighting factor to the realized price in line with the degree of supply tightness (HODLing) across the network. Large-scale HODLing acts to constrain supply, increasing the estimated 'fair value', and vice-versa. The chart below highlights periods where the spot price trades above the classic Realized Price üîµ (a floor model), but below the cycle all-time-high. From this we have a few observations:
The time between a successful break of the Realized Price and making a new ATH has historically been 14 to 20 months (with 11-months thus far in 2023).
The path to a new ATH has always involved major fluctuations of
¬±
50% around the
Active Investor Realized Price
üü† (shown in oscillators for each cycle).
Should history be our guide, it would paint a roadmap of several months of choppy conditions around this 'fair value' model (currently at ~$36k).

The Mayer Multiple is another popular as a technical pricing model for Bitcoin, simply describing the ratio between price and 200-day moving average. The 200-day MA is a widely recognized indicator for establishing macro bull or bear bias, making it a useful reference point for assessing overbought and oversold conditions.
Historically, overbought and oversold conditions have coincided with Mayer Multiple values exceeding 2.4, or below 0.8, respectively.
The present value of the Mayer Multiple indicator is at 1.47, close to the ~1.5 level which often forms a level of resistance in prior cycles, including the Nov 2021 ATH. Perhaps as an indicator for the severity of the 2021-22 bear market, it has been 33.5-months since this level was breached, the longest period since the 2013-16 bear.
Live Standard Workbench
Another lens for assessing 'fair value' for Bitcoin is to translate on-chain activity into the price domain via the NVT Price model. The NVT Price is seeking a fundamental valuation of the network based on its utility as a settlement layer for USD-denominated value.
Here, we consider a 28-day üü¢ and a 90-day üî¥ variants, providing a pair of fast and slow signals, respectively. A typical bear-to-bull transition phase sees the faster 28-day variant trading above the 90-day model, a condition which has been in play since October.
The
NVT Premium
üü† can also be used to assess spot pricing relative to the slower 90-day NVT Price. The recent rally printed one of the sharpest spikes in the NTV premium indicator since the market top in Nov 2021. This suggests a potential near-term 'overvaluation' signal relative to network throughput.

The Marginal Investor
In prior editions of this newsletter (
WoC 38
) we explored the outsized influence that new investors (also called Short-Term Holders) have in shaping near-term price action such as local tops and bottoms. Conversely, activity by Long-Term Holders tends to have more significant influence as the market reaches macro extremes, such as breaking to new ATHs or during painful capitulation events and bottom formation (see
Following the Smart Money
and
Buying High and Selling Low
)
.
To reinforce the impact of STH behavior, the following chart highlights the relationship between price moves (trends and volatility) and changes in the profitability of this cohort of investors:
STH Supply In Profit üü¢:
The number of coins held 'in profit' by STHs, having a cost-basis lower than the current spot price.
30D-Floor
üü®: The minimum 'in-profit' STH coin supply over the last 30-days.
90D-Floor
üü•: The minimum 'in-profit' STH coin supply over the last 90-days.
These 30D and 90D indicators allow us to gauge the proportion of STH capital which is 'in -profit' over different time windows. In other words, we can compare these traces to measure how many STH coins have been held 'in-profit' for under 30-days, 30 to 90-days, and more than 90-days.
Historically, rallies towards new ATHs coincide with the 90-day metric reaching above 2M BTC, suggesting a moderately long hold time by this cohort (a robust investor base). The rally since October has primarily lifted the 30-days variant, suggesting a solid STH foundation has not yet been established since trading above the $30k mid-cycle level (see
WoC 43
).
We also note 2023 traces are relatively low compared to past cycles, reinforcing the relative supply tightness we covered in
WoC 46
.
Live Advanced Workbench
Short-Term Fear and Greed
The next step is to build a tool that identifies periods of heightened fear and greed among these newer investors, focusing on overbuying (tops) or overselling (bottoms) signals. We introduced the
STH-Supply Profit / Loss Ratio
in
WoC 18
, which provides a proportional look at unrealized profit to loss. As shown in the chart below:
Profit/Loss Ratios > 20
historically align with overheating conditions.
Profit/Loss Ratios < 0.05
historically align with oversold conditions.
Profit/Loss Ratios ~ 1.0
signifies break-even and tends to align with support/resistance levels within the prevailing market trend.
Since January, this metric has traded above ~1, with several retests and support found at this level. These conditions are historically associated with 'buy-the-dip' investor behavior patterns common during uptrends.
We also note that the October rally drove this metric well above the overheated level of 20, which signals a higher-risk structure and a similar 'overheated' condition to the NTV-Premium indicator.
Live Professional Workbench
The above oscillator accounts for the
Unrealized Profit/Loss held by STHs
, which can be considered their 'incentive to spend.' The next step is to assess whether these new investors took action and
Realized Profits (or losses)
, bringing supply back onto the market and creating sell-side resistance.
The chart below maps four different measures of realized profit/loss by STHs (all normalized by Market Cap):
üü¢ STH Volume in Profit to Exchanges and üîµ STH Realized Profit
üü† STH Volume in Loss to Exchanges and üî¥ STH Realized Loss
The key insight from this study is identifying periods where there is a reading across both the Realized Profit/Loss, and Volume in Profit/Loss to Exchange pairs. In other words, STHs are both sending lots of coins to exchanges, and the average delta between acquisition and disposal prices is large.
With this in mind, this week's rally to $44.2k provoked a high degree of STH profit-taking activity, suggesting this cohort acted upon their paper gains, taking advantage of demand liquidity.
Live Professional Workbench
We can then distill this observation further by highlighting days where STH realized profit increased by more than one standard deviation over the last 90-day average üü•. We can see that this indicator has flagged local peaks throughout the last three years.
Live Professional Workbench
Using the same workflow, periods of high loss taking by STHs typically reaches one standard deviation level during major sell-off events. This signals when investors panic and send recently acquired coins back to exchanges for disposal at a loss.
Live Professional Workbench
We can of course bring both of these indicators into a single chart, creating a tool to help identify near-term overheated/oversold conditions based on the spending behavior of the STH cohort.
As we can see, the recent rally to $44.2k was accompanied by a statistically meaningful degree of profit-taking by STHs. Alongside the NTV-premium and extended Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, we can see a confluence of factors suggesting a potential saturation of demand (exhaustion) may be in play.
Live Professional Workbench
Conclusion
Bitcoin performed a round-trip this week, rallying to new yearly highs before selling off back towards its weekly open. After such a powerful 2023 thus far, this rally in particular seems to have met resistance, with on-chain data suggesting STHs are a key driver.
We present a series of indicators and frameworks highlighting local over and under-valuation for Bitcoin. These metrics draw on both investor cost basis, technical averages, and on-chain fundamentals such as transaction volumes. We can then seek confluence within (un)realized profit/loss metrics, which show when investors start taking chips off the table."

2023 has been an incredible year for digital assets, with Bitcoin up over 172%, correcting less than 20%, and net capital inflows into BTC, ETH and Stablecoins.
The market has broken above several important technical and on-chain pricing models this year, with October being a major pivot point for institutional capital flows.
Long-Term Holders currently hold a near all-time-high of the Bitcoin supply, and a super-majority of coins are now held in profit.
Major market structure shifts are taking place, such as Tether re-asserting dominance amongst stablecoins, CME futures flipping Binance, and significant frowth of Options markets.

In this last edition for the year, we will do a whirlwind tour of what changed this year, on-chain. We will explore how the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Derivative, and Stablecoin landscapes have evolved in 2023, and how this sets up the space for an exciting road ahead.
2023 has been an exceptional year for digital assets, with Bitcoin's market cap increasing by a peak of +172%. The rest of the digital asset ecosystem has also had a strong year, with Ethereum and the wider altcoin segments seeing +90% growth in their market caps.
This highlights a rising Bitcoin dominance, which is often seen as the market recovers from protracted bear markets, such as 2021-22. Ethereum in particular has had a somewhat slow start on a relative basis, with the ETH/BTC Ratio declining to multi-year lows at around 0.052, despite a successful shipping of the Shanghai update, and growth of its L2 ecosystem.
Whilst digital assets have significantly out-performed traditional assets like Equities, Bonds, and Precious Metals all year, the rally since late in October has been responsible for the lions share of the gains. This started with a break above the psychologically important price level of $30k, as well as numerous important pricing levels.
Live Chart
No Pullbacks Given
One of the standout features of the 2023 market has been the remarkably shallow depth of all price pullbacks and corrections. Historically, periods of bear market recovery, and bull market uptrends for BTC regularly see at least -25% pullbacks from the local high, with many examples exceeding -50%.
However, the deepest correction in 2023 closed just -20% below the local high, suggesting that buy-side support, and the overall supply and demand balance has been favourable all year.
Live Chart
Ethereum has also seen relatively shallow corrections, with the deepest reaching -40% in early January. Despite the more sluggish performance relative to BTC, this also paints a constructive backdrop where reduced supply issuance from the Merge, is meeting relatively resilient demand flows.
Live Chart
The 2022 bear market was marginally less brutal than the 2018-20 bear cycle, with most major digital assets starting off 2023 at a -75% drawdown from the ATH. The strong performance since the lows recovering a large percentage of their losses. The major assets are currently trailing their ATHs by -40% (BTC), -55% (ETH), -51% (Altcoin excl ETH and Stablecoins), and Stablecoin supplies (-24%).
Live Chart
From an on-chain perspective, the Realized Cap for BTC and ETH provides an excellent tool for tracking the recovery of capital flows into the respective asset. The total Realized Cap drawdown during the 2022 bear reached similar levels to prior cycles, reflecting a net capital outflow of -18% for BTC and -30% for ETH.
Capital inflows have been recovering at a much slower rate however, with the Bitcoin Realized Cap ATerH hit ov 715-days ago. This compares to a full recovery of the Realized Cap taking around ~550-days in prior cycles.

Breaking Through $30k Resistance
The Bitcoin market overcame numerous technical and on-chain pricing models this year, all of which help us appreciate just how strong the performance has been.
The year started out with a short squeeze in January which pushed the market above the Realized Price üü†, which had effectively capped prices since June 2022. This upswing also broke through the 200D-SMA üîµ, until it meet resistance at the 200W-SMA üî¥ in March.
Bitcoin prices proceeded to consolidate between the 200D-SMA üîµ and the True Market Mean Price üü¢ until the August, leading into one of the least volatile periods in Bitcoin history (see
WoC-32
and
WoC-33
). Shortly after, a swift deleveraging event brought prices from $29k to $26k in a single day, and below both of the aformentioned long-term technical price averages.
It was the rally in October which really changed the game, recovering through all remaining price models, and breaking through the key psychological $30k level. Bitcoin ha since reached its yearly high of $44.5k, and is consolidating around $42k at the time of writing.
Live Chart
A common thread readers may notice in this article is how capital flows, market momentum, and performance have accelerated since late October. In
WoC-49
, we explored how this was associated with BTC prices breaking above the $30k level, which we characterise as a transition from the 'uncertain recovery' phase into an 'enthusiastic uptrend'.
Notably, the October rally broke through two important levels which have delineated this transition in prior cycles:
The technical market mid-point:
being a price level broady acting as support during the early bear, and resistance in the late bear. This cycle, $30k was the last major area of support before a series of capitulation sell-offs, culminating with the collapse of FTX.
The Cointime True Market Mean Price:
which reflects the cost basis of active investors. This model was developed within our
Cointime Economics research
in collaboration with ARK Invest.
Live Chart
We can also see a marked change in character across our Recovering From a Bitcoin Bear Signal, as all eight indicators have entered positive territory since October. Readings were spotty through most of 2023, displaying a very similar character to the 2019-20 period.
With all eight indicators now firing, this suggests that across several metrics, and areas of Bitcoin market structure, the market has entered positive territory often associated with resilient uptrends.
Live Chart
Upticks in Volume, Fees, and Inscriptions
Supporting the notion that October was somewhat of a market phase shift, we can see that transaction volumes for Bitcoin were relatively stagnant up until that point. The October rally motivated transfer volumes for Bitcoin to double from $2.4B/day to a over $5.0B/day, the highest levels since June 2022.
Live Chart
We can also see Exchange inflow and outflow volumes for BTC and ETH picking up throughout the year, suggesting a general expansion in spot trading interest. Of note is how BTC volumes are increasing significantly faster than ETH volumes, aligned with the observation of rising Bitcoin dominance. It is common for BTC to lead investor confidence out of the doldrums following long bear markets, and this chart helps visualise this phenomena.
Bitcoin transaction counts reached new all-time-highs this year, largely due to the unexpected rise of Ordinals and Inscriptions. These transactions embed data such as text files and images within the signature portion of a transaction.
As a result, we can now assess two types of Bitcoin transactions:
üü† Total Transaction Counts
(unfiltered)
üîµ Monetary Transactions
which have reached a new multi-year, and almost all-time highs of 372.5k/day.
üî¥ Inscription Transactions
which have added an additional 175k to 356k transactions per day ontop of the classic monetary transactions.
üí°
For more information on Inscriptions, please see
our dedicated report
on the topic, as well as
WoC-7
,
WoC-39
for our assessment of market impacts.
Live Chart
The vast majority of inscriptions tend to be text based, and are associated with a novel token standard referred to as BRC-20 üîµ. At the peak, the Bitcoin network has seen over 300k inscriptions per day, well and truly eclipsing the peak of 17.2k/day for Image based inscriptions üü† in April (images are larger and thus more expensive to inscribe as fees increase).
Live Chart
As a result of this new buyer of Bitcoin blockspace, miner revenue from fees has increased significantly, with several blocks in 2023 paying fees which even exceeded the 6.25 BTC subsidy. There have been two major fee spikes this year, with fees now accounting for around a quarter of miner revenues. This is on par with the euphoria phases of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets.
Live Chart
Interestingly, whilst Inscriptions account for around 50% of confirmed transactions, they surprisingly only take up around 10% to 15% of blockspace. This is a result of both the small size of text files, and nuances associated with the SegWit data discount (a topic we cover in
WoC-39
).
Live Chart
Inscriptions have contributed between 15% and up to 30% of the total transaction fee revenue for miners this year. This highlights the unintuitive nature of the SegWit discount, where Inscription transactions consume a minority share of blockspace (in bytes), pay a meaningful proportion of fees, but also account for around half of all confirmed transactions.
In effect, Inscriptions and the SegWit data discount allow miners to fit more transactions, which pay more fees, into the same maximum size block. The impact on miner revenues should demand for Inscriptions persist is likely to improve miner economics meaningfully, especially with the fourth halving fast approaching.
Live Chart
Bridges, Staking, and Shanghai
For Ethereum, on-chain activity has been a little on the sluggish side this year, with October again being a notable inflection point.
Active Addresses has been relatively flat at around 390k/day
Transaction counts have recently increased from 970k/day to 1.11M/day
ETH Volume Transferred has increased from $1.8B/day to $2.9B/day
Live Chart
Whilst the market price of ETH has generally under-performed the wider digital asset space, its ecosystem continues to expand, mature, and grow. In particular, the Total Value Locked into the ever expanding fleet of Layer-2 blockchains has increased by 60%, with over $12B now locked into bridges.
These L2 chains are seeking to scale and expand Ethereum blockspace, whilst anchoring their data and finality into the Ethereum main-chain to maintain their security.
Live Chart
The other key area of growth for Ethereum has been the total volume of ETH staked via the new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Staked ETH has seen a 119% increase in volume YTD, reaching over 34.638M ETH now locked into the staking protocol. The Shanghai update was also successfully rolled out in April, allowing stakers to complete withdrawals, and reshuffle their staking providers and setups for the first time since the Beacon chain launched in Dec 2020.

Taking a Long-Term View
Despite the incredible price performance of Bitcoin, a large portion of BTC remains dormant, and reaching Long-Term Holder status in investor wallets. Out of a total circulating supply of 19.574M BTC, over 14.900M (76.1%) are held off exchanges and have not moved in over 155-days, increasing by 825k BTC YTD. This also puts Short-Term Holder Supply at what is effectively an all-time-low of 2.317M BTC.
üí°
We explore the growing supply tightness of Bitcoin across several pror reports including
WoC-26
,
WoC-45
and

.
Live Chart
As the market rallies, a super-majority of investor coins have returned to being 'in-profit', whether due to changing hands, or by prices rallying above the cost basis. The chart below shows how the total volume of coins held 'in-loss' has declined to around 1.9M BTC, with most held by Long-Term Holders who bought near the 2021 highs.
Live Chart
The flip side is that Supply held 'in-profit' is now over 90% of the circulating supply, with the October rally being the event making it above the all-time-mean. Given 2023 started out with over 50% of supply being underwater, this is one of the fastest recoveries in history (second to the rally in 2019).
Live Chart
The chart below visualises the change in percent supply in profit over each calendar year since 2015. Whilst the delineation by year isn't perfect, the classic four year Bitcoin cycle allows us to spot some interesting patterns:
üü†
Bear Floor/Recovery
sees the largest increase in supply in profit as coins capitulated near the lows return to profitable territory.
üîµ
Early Bull Market
where the general uptrend puts the majority of coins in profit, and rallies to new ATHs.
üü¢
Euphoric Late Bull
where the market is at ATHs, resulting in small positive, to negative readings since all coins are already in profit and the market nears exhaustion.
üî¥
Primary Bear
following the market peak, as significant volumes of coins fall into loss.
Whilst simple in construction, this framework really highlights the similarities between 2015-16, 2019-20, and the progress of 2023 thus far.
Live Chart
Lastly on the topic of investor profitability, 2023 has taken Long-Term Holders, Short-Term Holders, and the average holder from an unprofitable, to a moderately profitable state. The NUPL metric for each cohort is not yet at euphoric highs, but is also comfortably above the respective cohort break-even level.
Live Chart
Maturing Derivatives Markets
A defining feature of the 2020-23 cycle was the emergence of futures and options markets as the preferred venues for price exposure and liquidity. 2023 has proven to be an important year in this maturation, as Options markets have grown to match and even overtake Futures markets in open interest size.
Both now boast between $16B and $20B in open contracts, with Deribit continuing to dominate (90%+) the options space. This alludes to a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, as traders and positions utilize options market to deploy more sophisticated trade, risk management, and hedging strategies.
Live Chart
Within the futures market there has also been a noteworthy dominance shift, with open interest held at the regulated CME exchange overtaking offshore exchange Binance for the first time in history. Once again, October appears to have been an important moment for this phase shift, alluding to an influx of institutional capital.
Live Chart
Futures trade volume for both BTC and ETH saw an uptick in October, with a combined daily volume of $52B/day. Bitcoin contracts dominate around 67% of the trade volume, compared to 33% associated with Ether contracts.
Live Chart
The cash and carry yield available within futures markets have seen three distinct phases throughout the year which also tells a story about capital flows into the space:
January to August with yields fluctuating around ~5%.
This is largely in line with short-term US Treasury yields, and thus is relatively unattractive given the additional risk and complexity of the trade.
August to October with yields under 3%
following the sell-off to $26k, and a surprisingly low volatility environment.
October onwards as yields break above 8%
. With futures basis now maintaining levels 300bps above US Treasuries, market maker capital now has a meaningful incentive to return to the digital asset space.
Live Chart
Stablecoins Supplies
A relatively new phenomena the last cycle was the outsized role that stablecoins have played in market structure, becoming the preferred quote currency for traders, and a primary source of market liquidity.
Aggregate stablecoin supplies had been in decline since March 2022, falling by -26% from the peak, being a major headwind for market liquidity. This is due to a combination of regulatory pressures (SEC charged BUSD for being a security), capital rotation (preferring US treasuries vs non-interest bearing stablecoins), and waning investor interest in the bear market.
Live Chart
However October has been a pivot point, with total stablecoin supplies bottoming at $120B, and supply starting to grow at a rate of up to 3% per month. This is the first expansion in stablecoin supply since March 2022, and a likely sign of returning investor interest.
Live Chart
The relative dominance between various stablecoins has also undergone significant shifts between 2022 and 2023. Previously rising stablecoins like USDC and BUSD have seen their dominance shrink significantly, with BUSD entering redemption only mode, and USDC dominance falling from 37.8% to 19.6% since June 2022.
Tether (USDT) has once again asserted itself as the largest stablecoin, with total supply climbing to over $90.6B, and commanding 72.7% of the market share.
Live Chart
Finally, we can compare the 30-day change in the Realized Cap for BTC and ETH to that of the aggregate stablecoin supply. These three metrics help visualise and measure the relative capital flows, and rotation between sectors.
Once again, October stands out as a key moment where capital inflows into all three assets turning positive, aligning with the market breaking above the key $30k level, institutional interest expanding in derivatives markets, and net capital inflows to the three major digital assets.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
2023 almost couldn't have been more different to the devastating deleveraging and market downtrend of 2022. Instead, this year brought renewed interest in digital assets, significant out-performance, and new on-chain artefacts in the form of Inscriptions on Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin supply is currently tightly held by Long-Term Holders, and the majority of investors are now holding profitable coins. With a US based ETF looking increasingly likely in early 2024, and the Bitcoin halving due in April, the stage is set for an exciting year ahead.

In two short weeks, 2024 has already proven to be a real roller-coaster ride for Bitcoin investors. In what was arguably the most eventful financial product launch in history, the SEC approved ten spot Bitcoin ETF products to trade in US markets.
In many ways, Bitcoin managed to pull the traditional finance world, and US regulators, into its infamous world of chaos and volatility. The ETF approvals had a false start on 9-January, after the
SEC's X-account was compromised
, posting a false notice of positive approvals. BTC prices spiked to $47.2k, before quickly selling back down to $44.5k as reality set in.
A second false start occurred on 10-Jan as genuine SEC approval documents leaked from the SEC website before US markets had closed. Eventually, full confirmation was received for approval of all ten
ETF products
, with trading to commence on 11-Jan.
BTC prices set a new multi-year high in response, reaching just shy of $48.8k. The market then sold off -18% over the weekend, printing new YTD lows of $40.0k whilst traditional markets were closed. Bitcoin once again welcomed Wall Street to its world.

Spot ETFs Go Live
Over the first two days of trading, combined spot ETF volumes reached $7.823B, and with over $1.4B worth of AUM flowing in. This overwhelms the -$579M of outflows from the now converted GBTC ETF product, as investors reallocated after many years of poor performance during its time as a closed end fund (and with the highest ETF fee of 1.5%, lowered from 2.0%).

Despite these outflows, GBTC remains the ETF gorilla in the room, sporting $4.166B in trade volume over the two trading sessions, accounting for ~57% of the total. It is likely that funds will continue to reshuffle in-and-around GBTC over coming weeks.

The sheer scale of GBTC relative to other ETF products can be seen in the chart below by

In total, US spot ETF products now hold a combined 644,860 BTC (~$27.2B) and account for 29.7% of global ETF holdings after just two trading days.
Overall, the trade volumes and AUM make this one of the largest and most significant ETF launches in history, and in many ways marks the end of the beginning of Bitcoin's maturation and growing up phase.

A Sell-the-News Event?
Whether it is the halving, an ETF launch, or just another Thursday, Bitcoin investors love to debate whether the event was priced in, or not. Whilst there was significant volatility along the way, BTC prices remain more or less flat YTD, suggesting this particular event was priced to perfection.
Of course there are key driving factors behind the interim volatility, and both futures and options markets have seen a meaningful uptick in open interest (OI) since mid-October:
üü†
BTC Futures OI
increased by $7.0B (+66%), with $1.1B flushed out this week.
üîµ
BTC Options OI
increased by $6.6B (+70%), seeing $2.3B closed out by both contract expiration and closed positions this week.
Open interest for both markets remain near multi-year highs, indicating that leverage is elevated, and is becoming a more dominant force in markets.

We can see that there was a significant deleveraging event on 3-January where almost $1.5B of OI was closed out in a single day. Conversely, OI increased significantly between 9 and 11 January as ETF speculation peaked, and prices approached $49k.
This was greeted by a weekend sell-off back down to $40k, with new owners of ETF shares introduced to Bitcoin's 24/7 trading environment.
Live Chart
Perpetual funding rates have also maintained a strong positive bias, indicating leveraged traders are net long, and paying the short-side annualized yields exceeding +50% at times. We can also see the distinct phase shift which occurred in mid-October, whereby funding rates shifted from a structure of oscillating around neutral, to consistently positive.
Funding rates have cooled off this week, but do remain positive overall.
Live Chart
Options implied volatility has also reversed since mid-October, spiking higher during the week's chaotic events. Implied volatility has been in a multi-year decline since May 2021, as interest waned during the bear market. It is also noteworthy that options market infrastructure, liquidity and depth has matured significantly in 2023, with open interest now on par with futures markets (see
WoC-51-2023
).
This downtrend appears to have reversed in the near-term, with IV more than tripling since the low of ~30% in October, to over 97% this week. With spot ETF products opening new doors for both institutional and retail capital, it is likely the volatility profile of Bitcoin will also start to evolve.
Live Chart
Old Coins, New Hands
It is common for holders of long-dormant coins to respond during major market events. This includes periods when the market sets new ATHs, around cycle tops and bottoms, and during large shifts in market structure (e.g. Mt Gox, Halvings, and now the launch of spot ETFs).
The degree of Unrealized Profit and Loss held by these Long-Term Holders can be measured by LTH-NUPL. This metric reached 0.55 this week, which is meaningfully positive, and puts the average long-term investor at a 55% unrealized profit.
This is also a level where the Bitcoin bulls have met meaningful resistance in prior cycles.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holder Supply has also come ever-so-slightly off its ATH, declining by ~75k BTC since November as older coins are spent to take profits.
Whilst 75k BTC is a meaningful sum, it should also be viewed within the context of total LTH supply accounting for a whopping 76.3% of the circulating coin supply. The inverse measure, Short-Term Holder supply, is only just ticking up off all-time-lows as this spending takes place (covered in
WoC-46-2023
).
Live Chart
With that said, the amount of spending by these older hands is statistically significant, resulting in a +1 standard deviation increase in Revived Supply (spent coins aged 1yr+).
As we can see in the chart below, such events are relatively infrequent, however often align with up-trending markets meeting meaningful resistance.
Live Chart
As these older coins are spent back into liquid circulation, they contribute to what is now the largest profit taking event since the November 2021 ATH. The Realized Profit peak for this cycle was set on 4-Jan, with over $1.3B/day in profit locked in as coins change hands at a higher cost basis.
Profit taking is par for the course during a market uptrend, and the real question is whether the inflow of new demand will be sufficient to soak it all up.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The last week was historic in both a literal and a figurative sense. The scale of these new spot Bitcoin ETFs set new records, and a decade of hard work by the industry finally reached fruition. After more than a decade of hard work, against a backdrop of significant political, regulatory, and financial headwinds, the spot ETF ball has finally reached the end-zone.
It is somewhat poetic that this suite of spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading 15-years to the day since Hal Finney first tweeted

Several metrics in both on-chain and derivatives domains suggest that a non-trivial portion of Bitcoin investors did treat this as a sell-the-news event. The key question ahead is whether the inflow of demand from the ETFs, or in anticipation of the halving in April, or by the humble and reliable HODLers, will be sufficient to push through this resistance.
The ETFs may have been priced in, but for how long?"

In response to the approval of a suite of Bitcoin ETFs, Ether and Altcoins have rallied strongly last week. ETH managed to outperform BTC for the first time since October 2022.
ETH also has seen increased activity in derivatives market, signalling a possible shift in capital flows. Bitcoin remains dominant in open interest and trade volumes, however ETH has regained some ground since the ETF approvals.
We also assess the relative performance of Solana, scaling tokens, and various sector indexes relative to BTC and ETH as a gauge for risk appetite in a post-ETF world.

The Week On-chain dashboard
.
The digital asset markets experienced an uptick in speculation leading up to the Bitcoin ETF approvals, with a general sell-the-news event playing out over the following days. As we discussed in our last edition (
WoC-03
), the market had arguably priced the event to near perfection. Bitcoin prices have since fallen by -18%, dropping as low as $39.5k as of the time of writing.
Despite this correction, investors continue to look ahead, asking the question: Who‚Äôs next? Will there be new round of speculation regarding a potential ETH ETF approval? Will Solana continue to outperform ETH and BTC? Or is there now an appetite for risk and smaller market cap tokens?
Live Workbench Chart
Post ETF Speculation
Digital asset markets have experienced very strong performance since mid-October as ETF speculation and capital rotation narratives dominated.
Bitcoin's market cap has increased by +68.8% since BlackRock first filed for their ETF, and the aggregate Altcoin Market Cap followed suit, rising by +68.9%. However, Ethereum has seen more sluggish relative momentum, underperforming the wider altcoin space by -17%.
Live Workbench Chart
Zooming out, we can see that Bitcoin has generally been increasingly dominant over the past few years. Since the FTX Collapse in November 2022, BTC has increased its market cap dominance from 38.9% to 49.8%.
On the other hand, ETH has maintained its market cap dominance, ranging from 18.9% to 18.2%. It is mainly Altcoins that have lost market share in the crypto markets with their market cap dominance dropping from 28.3% to 24.2%, while Stablecoins have also decreased their share from 13.9% to 7.8%.
Live Chart
Shortly after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, several issuers have filed or suggested a willingness to advocate for a spot ETF for Ethereum. Although obtaining approval for an ETH-based ETF might be more challenging due to the SEC possibly considering Ether as more of an investment contract, the markets appeared to express optimism.
ETHs prices have surged by over +20% relative to BTC in recent weeks, making for the strongest performance since late 2022 on a quarterly, monthly, and weekly basis.
Live Workbench Chart
This coincides with a small rebound in the market cap dominance of both ETH and Altcoins in general. Compared to Bitcoin, ETH has gained 2.9% in market cap dominance.
Live Chart
Concurrently, the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors has reached a new multi-year high. While profits taking has increased taken since mid-October, the peak on 13-Jan reached over $900M/day, aligned with investors capitalising on the 'sell-the-news' momentum.
Live Workbench Chart
Positive market sentiment for ETH is supported by another indicator: Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for short-term token holders. STH-NUPL has crossed above 0.25 for the first time since the Nov-2021 ATH.
This suggests both a degree of optimistic market sentiment is creeping in for ETH but is also a level where markets tend to take a pause and digest profit taking distribution pressure. Historically, this type of sentiment shift for short-term holders has coincided with local peaks during a macro uptrend.
Live Advanced Chart
Derivatives Shift Focus
Given Ethereum's recent rally, it's worth examining its derivative markets to assess how leveraged markets are responding. In recent weeks we can see a meaningful uptick in trade volume for both futures and options contracts. Combined, ETH markets experienced a total trade volume of $21.3B/day, surpassing the average volume of 2023 ($13.9B), but it is still far from the typical levels seen in 2021 to 2022.
Live Workbench Chart
We can also compare the relative scale of ETH derivative markets to BTC, considering the dominance of futures open interest. BTC perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in Jan-2022, which has since risen to 66.2%.
Conversely, ETH open interest dominance decreased from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024. However, following the ETF approval, ETH regained some market share, with its dominance rebounding to ~40% by this metric.
Live Workbench Chart
There is also a relatively larger funding rate premium for ETH futures, indicative of a relatively higher risk premium compared to Bitcoin. For the past three months, ETH funding rates have surpassed those of BTC, but did not increase meaningfully in recent weeks. This suggests that there is not yet a substantial rise in speculative interest betting on relatively higher price movements for Ether.
Interestingly, when the ETH-BTC funding rate spread spikes above its 1y average, it typically aligns with local peaks for ETH prices.
Live Workbench Chart
ETH or Altcoins?
Digital asset markets are extremely competitive, and ETH is not only fighting for capital flows vs Bitcoin, but also relative to other layer 1 blockchain tokens.
Solana (SOL) has been a major stand out in 2023, seeing outstanding price performance last year, despite significant setbacks due to its association with FTX. SOL has gained considerable market share over the last 12-months, with the SOL/BTC ratio fluctuating between 0.0011 and 0.0005 SOL/BTC.
The SOL/BTC ratio has increased by 290% since October 2023, and significantly outperformed ETH during this period. Interestingly, unlike ETH, SOL's price did not experience any significant upwards revaluation after the BTC ETF approvals.
Live Chart
As stated at the start of this report, the Altcoin market cap has risen by nearly 69% since the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF filing. When we break down the Altcoin market into different sectors, it becomes clear that this trend has a primarily driver associated with tokens related to Ethereum scaling solutions such as OP, ARB, and MATIC.
Staking and GameFi tokens have also outperformed BTC since late last year. The Staking-Token/BTC Ratio rose by 103% in early 2023 but then fell by -65% until finding a bottom in December. Similarly, the GameFi-Token/BTC Ratio increased by +55% in Feb-2023 and has since decreased by -75%.
Scaling tokens reached their peak performance later in the year, seeing the Scaling-Token/BTC ratio rise by +95% in Q2 and Q3 2023. It is important to note that the Arbitrum token only launched in March 2023, being a likely trigger point for this outperformance.
All indexes experienced a slight increase after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, another indication of some risk appetite as BTC sold off after the news.
Live Chart
However in comparison to ETH, Altcoins simply have not held up in recent weeks. ETH outperformed Altcoins generally, gaining +4.2% in global dominance. This makes ETH the biggest winner in the post-ETF approval market movements.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
The approval of the new Bitcoin ETFs has bcome a classic sell-the-news event, leading to a tumultuous few weeks in the market. ETH has seen a burst of outperformance, emerging as the short-term winner. ETH investors have recorded a multi-year high in net realized profits, suggesting there is some willingness to sell-the-speculation on a potential ETH ETF capital rotation.
Solana has also become a strong competitor in the Layer 1 blockchain competition through 2023, although did not see any appreciable strength in recent weeks. The general Altcoin sector has also gained some momentum from the ETF excitement, with investors starting to front-run another speculative wave on the road ahead."

Bitcoin price performance since the 2022 lows shows striking similarity to prior cycles, albeit recovering somewhat slower, but in a more resilient manner.
Despite a modest uptick in older coin spending following ETF approvals, the majority of long-term Bitcoin investors remain unwilling to part with their coins at current prices.
Network activity remains low in terms of entities, but monetary volume transferred on-chain, and specifically to exchanges remains robust, and resembles prior bull market cycles.

Live charts are available within The Week On-chain dashboard.
Cycle Positioning
The first chart assesses BTC price performance since the previous ATH. In this instance, we consider April 2021 (the Coinbase direct listing) as the ATH for a better read on duration, since we argue that was the peak in terms of investor sentiment (WoC -4-2022).

The notion of history rhyming rings strikingly true, with the last 3 cycles experiencing eerily similar performance. Our current cycle remains marginally ahead of both the 2016-17 and 2019-20 periods, due in part to an extremely strong year in 2023.

🔴 Cycle 2: 45.7% below ATH

🔵 Cycle 3: 43.6% below ATH

⚫ Current Cycle: 37.3% below ATH


Live Workbench
However, a heightened level of resilience can be noted across our current cycle, with corrections from the local high remaining relatively shallow. The largest drawdown thus far has been -20.1% set in August 2023.

This insight becomes increasingly pronounced when we count the proportion of days which traded at a deeper correction by comparison:

🟠 Genesis to 2011: 164-of-294 days (55.7%)

🔴 2011 to 2013: 352-of-741 days (47.5%)

🔵 2015 to 2017: 222-of-1066 days (20.8%)

🟢 2018 to 2021: 514-of-1056 days (48.7%)


Live Workbench
Despite this resilience, price momentum has been to the downside over recent weeks, as the market digests the new dynamics of the spot ETFs.

Here, we consult two key on-chain levels:

🔴 Short-Term Holder Cost Basis ($38.3k), describing the average acquisition price of new demand.
🔵 True Market Mean Price ($33.3k), a cost basis model for active investors.
Retests of the STH Cost basis as support are typical during market uptrends, however, a decisive loss of this level would bring the True Market Mean into consideration. The True Market Mean Price is very much a ‘centroid’ of the Bitcoin market, often distinguishing bull markets, from bear markets.


Live Workbench
Recovery Meets the GBTC Overhang
We can assess both the severity of capital outflows across cycles, as well as the recovery duration by utilzing the fundamental Realized Cap metric.

The Realized Cap remains just -5.4% shy of its previous ATH of $467B, and is currently experiencing strong capital inflows. That said, the duration for this recovery to accelerate has been markedly slower than prior cycles, arguably due to the significant supply overhang from challenging trades like the GBTC arbitrage.

The current cycle has seen the Realized Cap recover at the slowest pace on record

🥇 2012-13 Cycle 0.22% per day
🥉 2015-16 Cycle: 0.09% per Day
🥈 2019-20 Cycle: 0.17% per Day
🐢 2023-24 Cycle: 0.05% per Day

Live Workbench
This phenomena can in part be attributed to the significant redemptions taking place from the Grayscale GBTC product. As a closed end trust fund, GBTC amassed an extraordinary 661.7k BTC in early 2021, as traders sought to close the NAV premium arbitrage.

After many years of trading at a severe NAV discount (with a very high 2% fee), conversion to a spot ETF has triggered significant a re-balancing event. Around ~115.6k BTC have been redeemed from the GBTC ETF since conversion, creating significant market headwinds.


Live Workbench
HODLers Won’t Let Up
Amidst strong rallies, sell-the-news events, and dynamic markets, the vast majority of HODLers appear to be calmly riding the market waves. This set of Supply Last Active metrics measure the proportion of the circulating supply which has been held for multi-year time horizons.

We can see a slight downtick across the 1y and 2y bands specifically, with many, but not all being associated with GBTC. This indicates that a non-trivial volume of older supply has been on the move in recent weeks.

However, in absolute magnitude, the vast majority of the BTC holder base remains steadfast, with the percentage of held supply across multiple age bands residing just below ATHs:

🔴 1+ Years Ago: 69.9%

🟠 2+ Years Ago: 56.7%

🟢 3+ Years Ago: 43.8%

🔵 5+ Years Ago: 31.5%


Live Workbench
In the WoC-46-2023, we introduced and compared several measures of “Stored Supply” and “Active Supply”. At the time, we noted a large divergence was in play between the two, with a significant dominance towards coins being dormant, inactive, and illiquid.

This year we see the first signs of a potential closing of this divergence, a notable increase across all measures of “Active Supply”. This provides confluence with the aforementioned uptick in older coin spending.


Live Workbench
This has triggered the largest increase in liveliness since the Dec-2022 capitulation event. This again supports the above analysis, denoting an increase in Coinday Destruction as some investors part ways with a portion of their long-held coins.

However, when viewed in a macro context, Liveliness remains near multi-year lows, suggesting that the dominant majority of the supply remains tightly held, arguably waiting for higher spot prices, or perhaps increased volatility as a motivator to spend.


Live Workbench
On-chain and Exchange Activity
Assessing on-chain activity for Bitcoin can provide great insights into the health, adoption, and growth of the network. However, despite strong price performance, a counter intuitive observation has emerged with the number of Active Entities declining to cycle lows of 219K per day.

At face value, this might suggest that despite the significant price appreciation, growth in Bitcoin users has not followed suit.

This is largely a result of the uptick in activity related to Ordinals and Inscriptions, where many participants are re-using Bitcoin addresses, and reducing the number of measured ‘active entities’ (does not double count).

💡
We detailed how analysts can better interpret Bitcoin on-chain activity metrics in WoC-28-2023 for further reference.

Live Chart
Transfer volumes on the other hand remains extremely robust with around $7.7B/day in economic volume processed. This divergence between ‘active entities’, and increasing transfer volumes highlights an elevated presence of large size entities active in the market, with the average Volume per Entity soaring to value of $26.3k/transaction.

This alludes to a growing presence of institutional investors and capital flows.


Live Workbench
Exchanges, remain the primary venue for trading activity, and deposit and withdrawal volumes have experienced a significant expansion, hitting $6.8B/day. Exchange related deposit and withdrawal activity accounts for approximately 88% of all on-chain volume at present.

The current volume flowing in and out of exchanges rivals peaks set during the 2021 bull market, with only 68 trading days (1.5%) recording a higher value (30D-SMA basis).

This again underscores an expanding interest in Bitcoin from market participants.


Live Workbench
Alongside increasing exchange flows, a regime of realized profit taking has followed suit. The chart below shows the average profit (or loss) per coin sent exchanges.

At the height of ETF speculation, this metric reached an average profit of $3.1k, a level reached at the peak of the April 2023 rally. This remains a far-cry from the $10.5k average profit at the zenith of the 2021 bull market, and is starting to cool off meaningfully.


Live Workbench
Conclusion
The approval of nine spot Bitcoin ETFs is a landmark event for digital assets, with institutional flows now openly gravitating to the asset class. Capital inflows are now accelerating, despite the significant supply overhang as investors rebalance out of the long challenged GBTC ETF product.

Exchange flows on-chain have also reached values equivalent to the peak of the 2021 bull market, and the average size of value transferred is highting a growing presence of institutional and large capital investors."

A benefit of this transparency is that it allows for analysts and investors to monitor market trends and momentum through a very wide range of metrics and indicators.
In this article, we will explore how on-chain data can be used to identify inflection points, and sustained periods of positive market momentum for Bitcoin. We will explore this concept through the lens of four on-chain analysis categories:
üü¢
On-chain Activity
: Using network activity and adoption to identify periods of growth and user-base expansion.
üîµ
Market Profitability:
Identifying periods where the unrealized profit held by investors is improving.

On-chain Activity and Adoption
Increasing usage of the Bitcoin network is a typical characteristic during periods of growth, where the user-base expands, network activity increases, and price tends to appreciate. As such, we can identify periods of positive momentum via metrics describing an uptick in on-chain activity.
Rising Fee Pressure
The first example utilizes on-chain fee revenue as a proxy for blockspace demand. Fee pressure will increase when users are expressing heightened urgency and a willingness to pay elevated fees for inclusion in the next block.
In this instance, we have applied a 2-Year rolling Z-Score to the proportion of miner revenue earned from fees. This metric selection and Z-score transformation achieves two goals:
Standardizes the data set across cycles.
Spots inflection points relative to the last 2yr half-cycle (e.g. an uptick in fees relative to a waning bear market, or a decline in fees after a cycle peak).

Exchange Inflow Volume Momentum
It is also typical for exchange related volumes and trading activity to climb during periods of network growth. Here we consider Exchange Inflow Volumes as it benefits from Glassnode‚Äôs entity-adjustment heuristics, and is a more direct proxy for spot trading activity.
We will use a simple fast/slow moving average cross-over transformation for this metric, seeking periods where the 30D-SMA is above the 365D-SMA. This indicates that near term activity is higher than the slower long-term baseline.
Analysts may also consider the magnitude of the deviation between these moving averages, as well as their gradient for identifying more advanced indications and divergences.

Unrealized Profit and Pricing
A primary advantage of on-chain analysis is the ability to monitor the cost basis of each coin considering the pricestamp at which it last transacted. We can use this toolkit of Unrealized Profit/Loss to identify price zones where a large volume of the supply has changed hands.
Supply in Profit Trend
During sustained market uptrends, the spot price continues to climb above the cost basis of increasing volumes of the coin supply (putting that supply ‚Äòin-profit‚Äô). To smooth out daily fluctuations, we have applied a 90D-EMA to the total Supply in Profit [BTC] metric.
We can then identify periods of positive momentum as those where the 90D-EMA of Supply in Profit is increasing. Here we use a 30-day difference function and display it as a üîµ oscillator. Positive values signify that the total supply in profit has increased over the last 30-days.
More advanced analysis can consider the magnitude and divergences of this oscillator, especially as it relates to cycle extremes (100% of supply in profit at ATHs, and when large volumes change hands near cycle lows).

MVRV and AVIV Inflection Points
Another powerful tool to monitor inflection points in investor profitability is the MVRV Ratio. In our prior report,
Mastering the MVRV Ratio
, we established an indicator for tracking market momentum based on a 365D-SMA cross-over methodology.
Live Workbench
More recently, we developed the AVIV Ratio alongside ARK Invest as part of the
Cointime Economics framework
. We consider AVIV to be a more representative unrealized profit/loss oscillator for active investors. From this, we can identify market inflection points:
Positive Momentum:
AVIV crosses above its 365D-SMA as investor profitability improves, often indicating many investors hold coins with a now favourable cost basis.
Negative Momentum:
AVIV crosses below its 365D-SMA as investor profitability worsens, often indicating many investors are trapped with an elevated and underwater cost basis.

Short-Term Holders In Profit
We can also leverage the Short-Term Holder MVRV to specifically track the unrealized profit or loss of new demand entering the market. Comparing the STH cost-basis to the spot price provides insight into the degree of pressure new market participants are experiencing to either capitulate at a loss, or to take profit.
A very simple momentum indicator can be achieved by tracking periods where STH-MVRV trades above or below 1.0.
This particular variant will be quite responsive (relative to MVRV and AVIV) as it only considers coins moved within the last 155-days. As such, it is quite sensitive to  periods when lots of coins have recently changed hands within a specific price range. As price trades away from that cluster, it dramatically changes the unrealized profit/loss position of STHs.

Realized Profit/Loss and Spending Activity
In the previous section, we assessed the unrealized profit/loss incentives which drive market participants to make decisions. These observations are well paired with metrics that describe whether investors actually take action in response to these incentives.
Thus, the next logical step is to evaluate the realized market response to these pressures.
SOPR Momentum
The first metric we consider is the SOPR indicator, which assesses the average magnitude of participant profit and loss taking events on any given day. The objective is to identify periods when profit taking is increasing relative to a longer term baseline.
To achieve this, we again utilize a fast/slow momentum cross-over strategy applied to the SOPR metric. We will also employ our Entity-Adjusted SOPR variant to ensure we capture only economically meaningful transactions, and exclude internal transactions and self-spends.

The second metric to consider is the ratio between Realized Profit and Realized Loss. This tools is particularly sensitive during regime shifts such as:
During strong uptrends there are relatively few coins in loss. However this changes rapidly during corrections, as recent buyers panic and spend previously profitable coins in loss.
Near bear cycle lows, many investors capitulate at steep losses, and there are relatively few coins in profit. As the market starts to recover, there is a dramatic uptick in realized profit relative to the preceding bearish trend.
We will again employ a momentum cross-over methodology to highlight periods where the Profit/Loss Ratio is experiencing rapid acceleration in either direction. This aides in identification of trend inflection points.

Wealth Transfer
SLRV Ribbon Momentum
The final charactestric we shall discuss is the transfer of wealth from longer-term investors, to newer and often less experienced investors. Typically, cycle bottoms are distinguished by a disproportionate amount of wealth held by Long-Term Holders. Conversely, cycle tops are often punctuated by a significant saturation by Short-Term Holders.
The balance of wealth held between these two cohorts can then be used to provide insight into the position of the current cycle.
To model this phenomena, we shall utilize the SLVR metric, which compares the wealth held by coins aged 24hrs to coins aged 6m-1y. A momentum cross-over of 30days to 150days is used, as originally proposed by the metric author

Constructing a Composite Momentum Indicator
Finally, a composite index of several of the aforementioned conditions can be constructed to produce a holistic model. The goal is to assess confluence across various categories;
Profitability
,
Spending Behavior
,
On-chain Activity
and the
Transfer of Wealth
.
Here we have weighted each individual component evenly, and applied a simple condition to flag when 4-of-8 conditions are met in blue. This has historically identified periods when the Bitcoin market is in a sustainable uptrend. We can also flag when all eight conditions are met in purple, indicating periods with extremely strong positive momentum across all categories.

Conversely, a composite index value of less than 4 denotes that on net, the majority of these momentum conditions are negative. This suggests the market is experiencing overall negative momentum, and is typically experienced throughout bear markets, including the initial inflection points.

Long-Term Holders have spend approximately 300k BTC since their supply peaked in Nov 2023. Just over half of these reflect GBTC outflow volumes.
With the market trading at multi-year highs above $50k, the volume of supply held in loss is thinning out, reaching just 13% of the global total.
The ETF sell-the-news correction in Jan-Feb has many characteristics of a classic 'bull market correction' through the lens of Short-Term Holders.

Thinning Supply
Bitcoin investors continue to enjoy a positive and strong year, with BTC market trading to new multi-year highs of $50.2k, and putting the YTD return at +18.5%. Only 141-days during 2021 have seen a daily closing price higher than $50.2k, representing just 2.84% of Bitcoin trading history.
Bitcoin is also up +130% over the last 12-months, and over +207% since the Nov 2022 lows, and is now trading just -28.6% below its ATH. With the market getting ever closer to the 2021 highs, the BTC supply which has a cost above this level is getting thinner and thinner.
This puts a super-majority of investors, and their held supply into profit, edging the market closer to yet another transitional phase, where Long-Term Holders start to take chips off the table.
The market saw a meaningful uptick in speculation in the lead up to the spot ETF approvals in January. In response, many Long-Term Holders (LTH) transacted their coins, whether to take profits, or perhaps to re-balanced their holdings into one of the new ETF products.

In total, LTH Supply balance has decreased by approximately 299.5k BTC since the metric peaked in November last year (at 14.996M BTC).
However, we must also consider the GBTC product, which saw over 661k BTC flow in during 2021, classifying its held supply as 'Long-Term Holder' status. Given GBTC has experienced around 151.5k BTC worth of outflows, this indicates that the remaining 148k BTC worth of LTH Supply can be attributed to LTH investors spending their coins. This aligns with
our prior research
showing that LTHs tend to commence distribution as the market approaches the ATH price.
Live Chart
Supply Discovery
As the market marches higher, a super majority of BTC has now moved into a profitable state. In fact, only 13% of the total supply were acquired above $48k and are therefore held in a state of loss.
The chart below presents a breakdown of the BTC supply by the cost basis at which it was acquired. We can see that the vast majority of coins (87%) were acquired below $48k, with a very large cluster of Short-Term Holder supply located between $40k and $45k. Long-Term Holders dominate this 13% of supply held in loss, reflecting 'top buyers' from the aformentioned 141 trading days in 2021.
GN Engine Room
We can see that the total volume of LTH Supply held in loss is currently 777.8k BTC, and is trending towards the zero bound as prices rise. Just 6.5% of the aggregate LTH supply is therefore held in loss.
Previous instances where the LTH cohort held a similar coin volume in loss corresponds with early bull market conditions (with 2019 as an arguable outlier).
Live Chart
Another way to visualise this is via the proportion of all supply held by LTHs in loss. At the bottom of bear markets, LTHs tend to carry the majority of unrealized losses, as speculators are flushed from the market, and the final capitulation results in a major transfer of coin ownership to high conviction holders.
By contrast, during the early phases of a bull market, this metric tends to reach consistently lower lows as the rising market rises and puts all LTH supply into profit. This metric appears to be following a similar pattern thus far, briefly falling below 60% during the recent correction to $38k.

contains several metrics for tracking market profitability.
Live Chart
Short-Term Reset
For the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort, the 'sell-the-news' correction after the ETFs launched has resulted in a healthy reset of several metrics.
First, we can see that the percent of STH supply in profit fell from its peak at ~100%, to retest its all-time-average of 57.5%. This means that almost half of all STH supply experienced prices falling below their acquisition price, making for a healthy correction. Historically, this tends to correlate with local lows being established when the market is within a macro scale uptrend.
Live Chart
We can also see this within the next chart, which presents STH Supply broken into the volume held in profit (orange) vs loss (red). This helps us visualise and distinguish periods of heightened risk, from the more 'garden variety' corrections and pull-backs.
Typical Correction Conditions
- When STH Supply in Loss increases, but does not exceed ~60% of their holdings. This suggests some portion of new investors are trapped with an unfavourable cost basis, but they are balanced by many who acquired and still hold coins from lower prices.
High Risk Conditions
- When STH Supply in Loss increases dramatically, often to a super-majority of their total, it suggests a 'top-heavy' market. Many investors are now trapped with an unfavourable acquisition price.
By this metric, the ETF 'sell-the-news' correction appears to have more characteristics aligned with a 'garden variety' correction.
Live Chart
Finally, if we take a ratio between STH Supply in Profit/Loss, we can again identify a near text-book retest of the break-even level of 1 (50:50 Profit/Loss split). During robust and resilient uptrends, these points of balanced STH supply profitability tend to form support.
Analysts can keep an eye on any deep breaks below this level, and in particular points where it flips to resistance, suggesting higher risk conditions are in play.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Long-Term Bitcoin investors have been rewarded for their patience and conviction, with both 2023, and the year to date thus far being remarkably positive. Whilst BTC prices are still 28% below their ATH, the amount of supply held at a loss is thinning quickly, with just 13% falling into this category.
If we account for GBTC behaviour, Long-Term Holders have transacted around 148k BTC since November last year. This potentially alludes to a transition in investor behaviour, as some coins are spent and profit taking starts to ramp up."

Since October last year, our Altseason Momentum Indicator has flagged a growing appetite from investors to move capital further out on the risk curve.
Whilst Bitcoin dominance remains significant, there are early signs of more capital rotation into the Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos ecosystems.
By investigating Uniswap liquidity pools, we can see that most capital remains in the most mature assets, and whilst TVL is moving out on the risk curve, trade volume has been slower to follow.
Anticipating Altseason
With the new spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining momentum, a bull market in the digital asset space is arguably in play. With this backdrop, we will continue exploring the question of capital rotation into altcoins we covered in
WoC 04
. In this edition, we will focus on how assets are performing further out on the the risk curve.
The goal is to assess how capital rotates and flows into the altcoin markets. We will again consult our
Altseason Indicator
as a macro indicator (see
WoC-41-2023
). This indicator assesses whether positive momentum is building within the Total Altcoin Cap, alongside continuous capital inflows into BTC, ETH, and Stablecoins.
Our Altcoin Indicator has signalled positive momentum since October last year, with a brief pause during the sell-the-news event after the Bitcoin-ETFs went live. It re-triggered on the 4-Feb.
Live Chart
In terms of market cap dominance, Bitcoin continues to lead with over 52% market share of the total digital asset market cap. In contrast, ETH accounts for 17%, stablecoins 7%, and 24% by the remainder of the Altcoin sector.
In terms of asset performance, BTC and ETH are leading the pack, with YTD gains of +17.6% and +18.2%, respectively. We note that following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, ETH has started to outperform BTC, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023.
On the other hand, the aggregate Altcoin market cap has not experienced the same performance, with YTD growth being less than half of the two majors.
Live Chart
Another lens to track performance is using the Realized Cap for each sector, which aggregates the cost basis value of all coins transferred on-chain. From this perspective we can better assess the movement of capital within digital asset markets:
Bitcoin is again clearly leading, seeing almost $20B in capital inflows per month at present.
Ethereum inflows tend to lag relative to Bitcoin, suggesting investors look for confidence and confirmation that digital asset markets are growing. In the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into BTC occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ETH.
Altcoins tend to see capital flows with a similar lag after ETH sees strength, with a duration of 46 days in mid-2021, and 14 days in late-2021.
It is evident that capital moves down the risk curve into Altcoins at a slower pace compared to the rotation between the two major cryptocurrencies, a trend which appears to be in play once again.
Sector Rotation
With signs of capital flows into the two majors, the next question is to observe how it flows further out on the risk curve over time. Over the course of the last cycle, several new Layer-1 ecosystems have emerged. Many of these compete with ETH for market share, not only in terms of innovation and user attraction, but also in terms of investor capital.
We therefore examine the top five tokens of some select ecosystems: Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Solana, to assess which are attracting the most investor interest.
Here we compare the weekly change in the aggregate market cap of the top five tokens in each ecosystem. Over the past 18-months, Solana has exhibited relatively high volatility, with upside performance being a standout. Polkadot and Cosmos have similar volatility, but with the Polkadot ecosystem outperforming latter.
Within the Ethereum ecosystem, we can specify three major sectors: DeFi, GameFi, and Staking. Since the beginning of this year, all three sectors have seen inflows, however the DeFi and GameFi sectors have seen relatively large capital outflows throughout 2022 and 2023.
This year has seen a reversal in the GameFi sector, with notable inflows starting in October, which coincides with the point when our Altcoin Indicator triggered. In contrast, Staking tokens have consistently experienced positive capital inflows, although less in absolute magnitude.
Out on the Risk-Curve
To determine whether, and to what extent investor interest is shifting out on the risk curve, we can refer to data sourced from Uniswap liquidity pools. Since Altcoins are often traded by more crypto-native traders via decentralized exchanges, activity on the most established DEX can serve as a proxy trends in Altcoin trading (note: this data reflects Uniswap trading on the Ethereum mainnet).
Altcoin trading interest was very low during the 2022 bear market, but has started to increase in mid 2023, driven largely by a bust of 'Meme-Coin mania'. Currently, Altcoin trading accounts for nearly 12% of Uniswap trade volume, approaching the 17.4% peak seen during the last bull run. In comparison, trading for WBTC and WETH makes up 47% and Stablecoins 40% of trade volume.
Liquidity Providers on Uniswap tend to closely monitor the markets, and changes in the distribution of liquidity across pools can provide an indication for prevailing market trends. By examining the composition of the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Uniswap, we observe that during Altcoin Season, there is increased liquidity profile for tokens outside the Top 50. This trend is indicative of growing investor interest in long-tail tokens.
During bear markets, liquidity is predominantly provided for the Top 50 tokens, as this is where the majority of trade volume occurs. The Top 10 tokens are mainly comprised of WETH, WBTC, and Stablecoins.
By looking at the percent change in TVL for each token category, we can detect an increase in liquidity provided for the Top 10 (5.14%) and Top 20 (10.9%) tokens, whilst liquidity has been removed for tokens ranked ranked 20 to 50. This suggests that the market appetite for long-tail assets has not yet picked up meaningfully.
We will now examine the pools for the top token in each Ethereum sector. This includes assessing the distribution of liquidity across various price ranges, and observing the evolution of market depth (similar to our hypothesis established in
WoC 36
).
The distribution between Altcoin and WETH reserve is well-balanced, with a slightly higher expected upside volatility accross the board. This indicates a generally bullish outlook from Liquidity Providers for these tokens. The exception is the GameFi token IMX.
When observing the rate of change in liquidity distribution, we see an increase in market depth for the -5% and +5% ranges, suggesting that Liquidity Providers are preparing for a period of elevated price volatility.
An exception to this is UNI, where Market Makers have increasingly concentrated liquidity closer to the current price range. This suggests less price volatility is expected for the UNI token, which is not surprising given it is one of the most established and mature tokens.
We now contrast this with the behavior of traders, where we can observe an increase in trading volume on Uniswap since October 2023, including tokens outside the Top 10. Trading activity is also rising for the Top 10 to 20 token pairs.
However, trading activity for the Top 20-50 token pairs and those ranked 50+ remains unchanged, which reaffirms our previous hypothesis: While liquidity provision is moving further out on the risk curve, trade volume has yet to follow.
Summary and Conclusion
The market momentum following the new Bitcoin ETFs, and the anticipation of a bull market in digital assets is starting to create shifts in capital flows towards Altcoins. Our Altcoin Indicator suggests a more mature and possibly sustained uptick in Altcoin markets, however it remains relatively concentrated in higher market cap assets at this time.
The digital asset landscape has evolved significantly over the last cycle, with new ecosystems emerging to challenge Ethereum's dominance. Solana has seen the strongest returns over the last year, however some movement is starting within the Polkadot and Cosmos ecosystems also. Within the Ethereum ecosystem, the Staking sector is showing the most consistent capital inflow for its top tokens.
A resurgence in Altcoin trading on Uniswap, alongside liquidity and trading volume patterns, underscores a cautious yet growing interest in longer-tail assets. This is initially showing up in changing liquidity provision, and an expectation of heightened volatility. This however is particularly present TVL within the pools, and investor trade volume has yet to follow."

Bitcoins recovery is near completion as capital continues to pour into the asset class, propelling the Realized Cap to $460B, and only 3% shy of its ATH.
Exchange inflow volumes are near all-time-highs, with Short-Term Holders dominating the flows. This suggests a relatively strong demand for speculation and trading activity.
Open interest in both futures and options markets are also near all-time-highs, and directional short-sellers continue to bet against the uptrend, resulting in over $465M in liquidation volume over the last 30-days.

Capital Flows
The Bitcoin price continues consolidating just below $52k, having held onto the majority of its gains since mid-February. Supporting this performance is what appears to be a steady and healthy inflow of capital into the asset, with the Realized Cap climbing by over $30B YTD. This places the total valuation of the Realized Cap at $460B, which is just 3% shy of the previous ATH.

Live Chart
As a result of this strong performance, the profitability of Bitcoin investors has improved markedly, with the average investor now holding an unrealized profit of +120% per coin.
The MVRV Ratio allows us to measure this, with values of this magnitude often seen during the early innings of prior bull markets. Around 1126-of-4965 trading days (22.7%) have seen MVRV record a larger unrealized profit. The air above the market is certainly getting thinner, but it is by no means uncharted.
Live Workbench
With the market largely in a state of unrealized profit, it becomes prudent to evaluate how participants have responded. For this, we can employ a suite of SOPR metrics, which assess the average magnitude of realized profit or loss by cohort.
üü†
Market Average SOPR
: 1.13 (+13% profit)
üîµ
Long-Term Holder-SOPR
: 2.07 (+107% profit)
üî¥
Short-Term Holder-SOPR
: 1.02 (+2% profit)
All cohorts are currently locking in meaningful realizing profits, which is typical of an uptrending market (highlighted in üüß). We have also flagged periods of time where all three SOPR variants exceed their current value in the past (in üü•). We can see these align with the most euphoric phase of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, a similar observation to MVRV above.
Live Workbench
Exchanges
With market momentum intensifying, and investors holding their largest unrealized gains since the Nov 2022 ATH, we can turn to inflows into the major exchanges as a measure for trading activity and speculation.
The total volume of deposits and withdrawals has continued to expand, reaching a staggering $5.57B in daily volume flowing in and out of exchanges, rivalling activity seen during the Nov 2022 market ATH.
Live Workbench
We can increase the granularity of the above observation by segrating inflows to Exchanges by on-chain cohorts, allowing us to characterize the source of the deposits. The breakdown of total exchange deposit volume is as follows:
üî¥ Short-Term Holders +$2.1B
üîµ Long-Term Holders +$120M
üü¢ Inter Exchange Volume +$354M
The STH Cohort have consistently deposited over $2B per day in volume since mid-January, whilst also setting a new ATH of $2.46B in volume deposited overall. This underscores a high degree of speculative interest within the current market structure.
Live Workbench
Further confluence can be found by evaluating the percentage of the overall STH balance sent to exchanges. Since Oct 2023, the STH cohort have been depositing upwards of 1% of their supply per day, peaking at a value 2.36% during the recent ETF led speculation. This is largest relative deposit since the March 2020 sell-off.
Live Workbench
The degree of speculation within the current market can also be seen by the extraordinarily high dominance of exchanges related in/outflows with respect to all on-chain volume. Currently, 78.3% of all economical on-chain volume is being directed to/from exchanges, which is coming off a new ATH.
Note, economical volume is defined as our entity-adjusted on-chain volume, which filters out internal transfers, wallet management, and self-spends to our best estimate.
Live Workbench
The new spot Bitcoin ETF products have also created a new source of demand for BTC, with an incredible +90K BTC in net flows migrating into the ETFs. These inflows account for a staggering $5.7B, and bring the total AUM of the ETFs to nearly $38B.
These ETF products have for the first time allowed institutional investors to gain exposure to the BTC asset via traditional rails, opening a new degree of freedom for demand and speculation.
Live Chart
Derivatives Overview
Alongside the uptick in speculation visible in on-chain flows, we can also see that derivative markets have responded similarly. The total Open Interest in futures markets has risen to a value of $21B, with only 84-of-1195 trading days (7%) recording a higher value.
The USD denominated value of open futures contracts is approaching the highs seen during the most euphoric periods of 2021.
Live Chart
Options markets have also experienced significant growth, with open interest hitting $17.5B. This is on a comparative footing to the $21B in futures markets, which is a relatively new development since 2023.
The growth in options markets suggests that Bitcoin derivative markets are becoming increasingly mature, with investors, traders, and miners now having deeper and more liquid options to hedge and manage risk.
Live Chart
The decisive breakout through $30k in October last year was a key point of interest, with notable changes across many parts of the Bitcoin market.
Prior to this rally, the yield available via a cash-and-carry strategy in futures markets was barely above 3% on a sustained basis, being less than the risk free rate available in US treasuries. Since then however, cash-and-carry yields have increased to 14.7%, providing a few indications:
Traders are willing to pay much higher interest rates to take on leveraged long positions.
The short-side is now able to capture 2x-3x the ‚Äòrisk-free‚Äô rate available in short term US Treasuries.
The yield available in futures markets is likely to start attracting market makers back into the digital asset space, deepening market liquidity.
Live Workbench
The spread between BTC and ETH funding rates is also is widening. Prior to October-2023, a relatively neutral regime can be observed, where the spread oscillated between positive and negative state.
However, since the October rally, funding rates for ETH have been consistently higher than for BTC, inferring an increased appetite by traders to speculate further out on the risk curve.
Live Workbench
We have also seen a regime of heavy short liquidation dominance during the rallies into ETF approvals. Whilst market neutral cash-and-carry traders are being attracted to the short-side, the market is still seeing directional short-sellers being liquidated at a higher rate than longs.
It is worth noting that at both ATH peaks in 2021, long traders dominated liquidation volumes, as leveraged positions were force closed within the intra-day volatility. As such, seeing such a strong dominance of directional short traders being liquidated suggests many traders have been betting against the prevailing uptrend since October.
Live Chart
This has led to a substantial growth in the the total short-side liquidations over the last 30-days, with over $465M in closed positions. The chart below highlights periods where short liquidations exceed those of longs, many of which align with powerful uptrends fuelled by short-squeezes.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
In lieu of the highest spot prices since Dec-2021, risk appetite amongst market participants has returned in style. This is highlighted by an acceleration of capital inflows, and a increasing activity amongst the Short-Term Holder cohort, whom are depositing over $2B of volume to exchanges per day.
Speculation activity is also present across derivative instruments, with both options and futures open interest being just shy of ATHs. With perpetual funding rates now providing yields in excess of 2x to 3x the risk free rate of US treasuries, there has been an uplift in liquidity and short-side interest. However, much of this appears to be directional, as many traders continue to bet against the prevailing uptrend (being liquidated as a result)."

Spot ETFs Demand
Many observers anticipated strong demand after the SEC approved Spot ETFs for US markets. At the same time, many were sceptical, and believed that the ETF news was already priced in, and thus expected a sell-the-news correction. With Bitcoin now trading at $68.0k, 58% higher than $42.8k at the time of ETF approvals, the sell-the-news camp have found themselves offside.
To better gauge the aggregate demand inflows, the chart below presents the weekly average of the USD flows via the following areas:
Network Issuance
üü™: The daily network reward to miners (assumed sell side), which has increased from $22M/day in September 2023, to $49M/day today.
All Exchanges Netflow
üüß: Focusing on the months leading up to the ETF approval date, centralized exchanges witnessed significant swings between positive (sell-side) and negative (buy-side) waves of capital flows. Since the ETFs started trading, this metric has shown a consistent outflow or buying pressure of up to $246M/day. At the end of last week, the aggregate exchange netflow was experiencing a $17M/day outflow.
US Spot ETFs Netflow
üü©: Despite an initial and significant sell-side pressure exerted by existing GBTC holders, the aggregate net flow into US Spot ETFs averaged $299M/day.
Overall, this represents an on-balance, and back of the envelope net capital inflow into Bitcoin of around $267M/day (‚àí49+17+299). This represents a meaningful phase shift in market dynamics and a valid explanation for the market's rebound towards new ATHs.

Diamond Hands in Profit
With the market getting near ATHs, both the unrealized profit held by long-term investors and the magnitude of their distribution pressure have increased accordingly.
One way to gauge the profitability of the market for any specific cohorts of investors is to leverage their on-chain cost basis (or the average price at which each cohort acquired their coins) and compare it with the spot price.
Long-Term Holders üîµ
= $20.7K
Short-Term Holders üî¥
= $45.8K
Market Realized Price üü†
= $24.4K
With price trading at $68k, the long-term holders are, on average, sitting on an unrealized profit of ~228%.
Live Advanced Workbench
We can plot the unrealized profit multiple held by long-term holders using the LTH-MVRV metric, which is a ratio between price and their cost basis. This ratio currently trades at 3.28, which falls between two historically significant threshold levels separating the following phases of a typical cycle.
Bottom Discovery
üü© (LTH-MVRV < 1): means, on average, these investors are at a loss.
Bear-Bull Transition üü® (1 < LTH-MVRV < 1.5)
: means long-term holder profitability is between break-even, and +50% profit.
Equilibrium üüß (1.5 < LTH-MVRV < 3.5):
means long-term holders have an average unrealized profit of +50% to +250%.
Euphoria üü• (3.5 < LTH-MVRV)
: means, on average, long-term investors are in more than +250% profit.
Based on the current value, these investors are approaching their Euphoria state with an elevated incentive to spend and take profits. Historically, this cohort ramps up their spending as new market ATHs are reached, with distribution accelerating until they help form the cycle macro top.
Live Advanced Workbench
Long-Term Players in Action
Now that we have established the magnitude of unrealized profit attributed to long-term holders, we must evaluate how these entities are reacting this shift in profitability.
A quick and straightforward method is to look at the Long-Term Holder Supply. As shown below, long-term investors have distributed approximately 480k BTC since December 2023, when LTH-MVRV was still in the Equilibrium phase. This means some of these investors began to spend at +50% to +200% profit on average, even before the ETF launch date.
Live Advanced Workbench
To assess distribution regimes by long-term holders, we consider two pillars: the distribution rate, and the continuation time.
The following chart displays the monthly change in the long-term holder supply. Zooming in on the last two major market expansions in mid-2019 and early 2021, we can see the distribution rate for LTHs reached peaks of 319k BTC/month and 836k BTC/month, respectively.
The distribution rate of this cycle has thus far peaked at 257 BTC/month, with outflows from GBTC accounting for approximately 57% of this.
Live Professional Workbench
As LTH distribution increases, so too does the magnitude of realized profit locked in. To monitor this dynamic, we have measured the proportion of LTH transfer volume in profit/loss relative to their overall balance.
At the time of writing, this indicator shows that LTHs are realizing profit at rates equal to 0.14% of their aggregate supply daily. This metric is approaching levels coincident with the early Euphoria phase and prior breaks of the market ATH.
Live Professional Workbench
In the last part of this investigation, we have created a binary indicator which identifies periods when LTH spending is of a magnitude sufficient to deplete their aggregate balance over a sustained 15-day period. This spending represents a release of long-dormant supply back into liquid circulation, which acts as a counterweight, offsetting new demand.

In the chart below, we have used several threshold values to categorize the spending regimes. Since late January 2024, the market has entered a phase where the binary indicator has flagged long-term holder supply decline for at least 8 of the last 15-days.
If we study the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops, A similar structure was sustained for between 123, and 225 days. With the current phase having been in this state for 42 days thus far, it may suggest that demand inflows could offset LTH spending for several months ahead, should history be any guide.

Conclusion
Once again, Bitcoin has surprised investors by rallying to the last ATH before the halving event, being the first such time this has occurred. The new US Spot ETFs have introduced a significant new source of demand into the market, offsetting the daily issuance and recent sell-side pressure deposited to exchanges by some margin.
Long-Term Holders are spinning up their distribution cycle, which is a trend we have seen in all prior cycles as the ATH is challenged. This allows us to compare these new demand vectors via the ETFs, with the distribution pressure from existing holders and explains Bitcoin's meteoric rise back to all-time highs."

Numerous metrics indicate a striking similarity to past ATH breaks, where a wealth transfer from old HODLers to new investors and speculators is well underway.
Realized profit metrics and futures funding rates have also spiked to significantly positive levels, suggesting elevated profit taking and demand for long side leverage.

Entering The Euphoria Zone
Bitcoin has broken to new all-time-highs relative to the USD this week, clearing the $69.2k level, and rallying over $72.3k. If we only consider the major breaks above the prior cycle ATH, this would be the fourth new cycle ATH in history.
In this edition, we will examine this phase shift into the 'Euphoria Zone' which tends to accompany new ATHs. From an on-chain data perspective, this moment has historically triggered a distinct shift in investor behaviour patterns, particularly in the relative balance between HODLers and the Speculator cohorts.

New Dashboard Released

A new dashboard is available exploring a the on-chain market mechanics of a Euphoric Bitcoin Bull Market.

The price is not the only metric to have recently reached a new ATH. The Bitcoin Realized Cap, being a measure of the total wealth stored in BTC on-chain, has also marched to set a new high of $504B, adding over $40B in capital inflows since 1-March alone.
The Realized Cap is currently increasing at a rate of $54B/month, approaching levels last seen during the run-up in early 2021. This highlights just how significant the capital inflows have been for Bitcoin, driven in part by the tremendous success and demand for the new US ETF products.
Live Chart
A Steady Transfer of Wealth
One of the classic patterns observed during Bitcoin bull markets is a transfer of wealth from old to young. Investors who accumulated BTC at cheaper prices several months to years in the past, tend to accelerate their distribution pressure as new ATHs are reached (see our
prior report
).
This wealth transfer is once again in play, with the proportion of wealth held by 'Young coins' (moved within the last 3-months), increasing by 138% since October 2023. This reflects a net expenditure by longer-term investors who had previously held their coins for at least 3-months.
Live Chart
We can see this dynamic play out over prior cycles through the lens of Short-Term and Long-Term Holder Supply. Here we can see that LTH supply has declined by -660k BTC since the peak in Nov 2023. As we covered last week (
WoC-10
), approximately 57% of this decline can be attributed to redemption from the GBTC ETF product.
Conversely, STH Supply has increased by +810k BTC over that same period, absorbing coins from two regions:
660k BTC transferred from Long-Term Holders.
150k BTC withdrawn from Exchange Balances we monitor.
Overall, this transfer of wealth appears to be following a very similar path to all prior Bitcoin cycles, and represents both a shifting ownership structure, but also the dynamic balance between supply, demand, and price.
Live Chart
As LTHs distribute coins, their sell-side must be absorbed by an influx of new demand. The challenge for analysts is to identify periods when this distribution pressure may be reaching a point of over-saturation and exhaustion of new demand. The chart below shows two traces:
üîµ The percent drawdown of LTH Supply from its peak.
üî¥ The percent uptick of STH supply from its cycle low.
At previous bull market peaks, LTH supply had declined by between -14%, and up to -25%, suggesting a relative degree of distribution pressure each cycle. Conversely, STH Supply tends to reach a maximum around the cycle top, increasing by more than 83% from its cycle low.
If we make the overly-simplistic, ballpark-grade assumption that these drawdown/uptick magnitudes reflect a point of supply/demand inflection at cycle peaks, it would indicate that the current market has experienced around 30% of the typical distribution cycle.
Live Chart
The RHODL Ratio is another popular metric for tracking this transfer of wealth from old HODLers to new investors and Speculators. It is constructed as the ratio between wealth stored within in 1-week old vs 1y-2y old coins.
The chart below has highlighted in üîµ where the RHODL Ratio crosses above its current value of 6.3k. We can see that this indicator is in a very similar position to all prior ATH breaks, suggesting the transfer of wealth is firmly in line with historical precedents.
Live Chart
By isolating traces for the wealth stored in each age band component (üî¥ 1wk and üîµ 1y-2y), we can visualise this transfer of wealth over the course of the cycle.
At the lows of bear markets
, the HODLer cohort holds a dominant proportion of the wealth, with the 1y-2y curve üîµ reaching its cycle peak.
At the tops of bull markets
, the Speculator cohort now dominates the supply, with the 1-week curve üî¥ peaking, alongside prices reaching their cyclical top.
Once again, a market break to new ATHs corresponds with a switching of dominance, where the capital held by new investors and Speculators overtakes that held by longer-term HODLers.
Live Chart
Taking Profits
This distribution pressure by Long-Term Holders is of course balanced by an equal magnitude of inflowing demand from the Short-Term Holder cohort (since every seller is matched with a buyer). The revaluation of older coins from a lower cost basis to a higher one necessitates a capital inflow, as the new buyer must acquire those coins at a higher aggregate value.

We can therefore relate capital inflows to both upticks in the realized cap, but more directly with the Realized Profit metric. This week, the magnitude of Realized profit locked in via on-chain spending reached statistically high levels, trading more than one standard deviation above its long-term mean.
This also reflects very similar conditions to the start of prior 'Euphoria' phases, such as the 2017 and 2021 bull markets.
Live Chart
In this final chart, we highlight quite an intriguing observation, relating a popular on-chain metric, SOPR, to the funding rates observed in futures markets. The chart below has two traces:
üîµ
Entity-Adjusted SOPR (minus 1)
, reflecting the average profit/loss multiple locked in by economical on-chain spending (filters out internal transfers and similar). Higher values indicate that the average coin being spent are locking increasingly large profit magnitudes on average.
üü†
Futures Funding Rates (Annualized)
, which reflects the interest rate paid from longs to shorts (when positive, and vice versa when negative). Funding rates can help measure both the magnitude, and direction of leverage in futures markets, as well as the incentive for market makers to add liquidity to orderbooks to arbitrage the premium (via a cash-and-carry trade).
The similarity between these traces is quite striking, suggesting they are telling analysts a similar story, but from a different lens. Both metrics have increased to levels coincident with the late-2020 to early-2021 bull market. This indicates that profit taking is elevated, ans so is long biased leverage in futures markets.
More specifically, the average on-chain spend is locking in a profit of +27%, whilst speculators in futures markets are willing to pay an interest rate in excess of 35% to 45% for access to leverage. Both metrics have reached and persisted at much higher levels in the past, but are certainly now well within 'Euphoria Zone' territory.

Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin has broken to its fourth new cycle ATH this week, trading above $72k for the first time. This move is supported by massive capital inflows to the asset, with the Realized Cap climbing at a rate of around $54B/month, in line with the 2021 bull cycle highs.
Across numerous metrics, the current cycle is surprisingly and eerily similar to previous ATH breaks, with the transfer of wealth from HODLers to new investors and speculators well under way. This dynamic reflects a healthy balance between distribution pressure, and new demand, but also gives us a glimpse into the mechanics which, eventually, go on to establish cyclical tops."

The Dencun Upgrade on Ethereum introduces new data storage capacities, aimed at reducing fee costs of its Layer-2 scaling solutions.
The upgrade also implements a fixed limit for entering validators to manage the growth of the validator set and maintain efficient node communication.
This change could influence Ethereum's monetary policy by reducing the rate of new Ethereum issuance. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the Ethereum supply.
Reducing Costs for Scaling Solutions
On Wednesday, March 13, Ethereum underwent another major update. The Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, which introduced significant changes to Ethereum's rollup infrastructure. The upgrade also implements several modifications to Ethereum's staking pool to improve node communication, and network stability.
Over the recent years, various solutions have emerged to help the Ethereum network process more transactions in aggregate. Roll-ups are a blockchain which executes transactions externally to the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing a separate execution environment. They aggregate batches of transactions occurring on the roll-up, and anchor them into a single transaction, which is then submitted to, and verified by the Ethereum blockchain.
Roll-up solutions have gained popularity over the last 2 years, with the two major scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, seeing usage increase by up to 150k, and 100k daily active addresses, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum's mainnet still has the largest activity count, with more than 400k active addresses per day.
The major feature of the Dencun upgrade is to create additional data storage capacity on the Ethereum network. It introduces a new type of transaction capable of carrying large data packets which are referred to as blobs.
Blobs are temporarily stored on the consensus layer instead of the execution layer, which leads to decreased fee costs for both the Ethereum network, and the roll-ups themselves. As displayed in the table below, transaction costs have decreased significantly after the upgrade, with Optimism and StarkNet even recording fees below 1 cent.
Normalizing into USD allows us to understand how roll-up fees behave differently relative to mainnet fees. Since their inception, roll-ups have offered cheaper and less volatile fees, ranging between $0.10 to $0.30 per transaction for both Arbitrum and Optimism. In contrast, Ethereum mainchain fees range from $2 to $7 over the same period.
During high-activity events where there is an influx of demand for Ethereum blockspace, fees can escalate to over $30. Prior to Dencun, fees on roll-ups were somewhat dependant on mainchain fees, and have seen their fees increase up to a maximum of $2.50 during similar situations.
The co-dependence of roll-up fees on the high volatility of the Ethereum fee market tends to result in more expensive and challenging user experience overall. These layer-2 solutions also impacted the Ethereum fee market by adding a new source of demand for blockspace. According to a
report by Fidelity
, the transaction fees that the various Layer-2 chains paid, typically account for around 10% of all total fees paid on Ethereum's mainnet.
Source:
Fidelity Digital Assets
With the Dencun upgrade, the separation of Layer-2 anchoring transactions into blobs is largely in line with improving user experience, reducing fees, and aligned with the rollup-centric roadmap of the Ethereum Foundation. The hope is that lower transaction fees will encourage more users to move onto roll-ups, thereby increasing the aggregate Ethereum based transaction throughput. This strategy aims at improving scalability without compromising the decentralization and security of the mainchain.
Shortly after the introduction of the first set of scaling solutions for Ethereum, we observed an increase in average transaction throughput in mid-2021 was 105 Transactions per Second (TPS). Of this, roll-ups accounted for around 46 TPS, or 44% of the total.
This provided an initial indication of success for the roll-up centric roadmap, and similar Layer-2 scaling solutions. However, when compared to Ethereum's biggest competitor,
Solana
, which averages around 2.6k TPS, there's remains a significant difference, largely a function of the design architectures of Modular (e.g. Ethereum) vs Monolithic (e.g. Solana).
Adjustments to The Staking Pool
The Dencun upgrade also introduces new technical changes which impact stakers on Ethereum, largely aimed at improving user experience:
Perpetually valid signed exits
enhance the user experience for delegated staking participants (such as liquid staking pools). At present, the signing-key required to authorize exit of a user's stake from a staking pool resides with the validator operator. This arrangement makes the stake owner reliant on the goodwill of the validator operator when they want to exit their position. After the Dencun upgrade, validator operators can pre-sign voluntary exits, allowing the stake owner to unilaterally exit their stake.
Increasing the attestation window
extends the time validators have to vote on a block's correctness from 6.4 minutes to 12.8 minutes. This allows for more attestations to be gathered, which can accelerate the block confirmation process. The attestation count currently stands at approximately 759k attestations per day.
A fixed limit for new validators
has also been added,
seeking to slow down the growth of validator set. At the moment, the churn limit regulates how many new validators can enter of exit the staking pool each day. This limit increases by one step at defined increments of total active validators.
After the Shanghai upgrade, the number of active validators saw a large increase, averaging +1347 new validators per day. However, as the number of validators increased, it was noticed that a side-effect was a slowing down of node communication.
The Dencun upgrade has now introduced a limit of 8 new validators per ~6.4min epoch in place of the churn limit function.
A slowed growth in the validator set and effective staking balance has a secondary effect on Ethereum's monetary policy. The current rate of ETH issuance is based on the number of active validators, and as fewer can now enter the staking pool, it may slow down the rate of new ETH issuance.
Since the Shanghai Upgrade, the issuance increased from ETH 1183/day to ETH 2554/day as the validator set grew. Whilst early, we have seen issuance rates decrease for the third time shortly after the Dencun upgrade.
A potentially slower issuance may also act as a net decrease for the Ethereum supply, as more ETH is burnt via transaction fees than the amount of new ETH issued. Since the Merge, we have observed a net reduction in the total circulating supply of -410k ETH.
The combined impact of the Dencun upgrade on the ETH supply remains to be seen as there are now a few changes which impact each other:
Layer-2 anchoring transactions have now moved into the blob data structure, removing around 10% of the fee congestion pressure. This may result in a slight reduction in ETH burned.
The reduced fees on Layer-2s may entice more usage of both the Ethereum mainchain and the scaling solutions, which could add to fee pressure.
The rate of issuance growth is likely to reduce as fewer new validators are able to enter the staking pool.
Throughout its history, Ethereum has undergone six major updates, not all of which have directly targeted a change to the ETH supply. However, it's apparent from the last four upgrades that the growth of the ETH supply has slowed. After the Merge, it has even turned slightly negative. The chart below shows these different upgrade events alongside the relative change in the circulating supply of ETH.
Summary and Conclusion
The Dencun Upgrade introduces significant enhancements to the Ethereum network, by creating additional data storage capacity via blob transactions. This upgrade effectively reducess fee costs for its various scaling solutions, which improves user experience, and potentially increases aggregate transaction throughput by encouraging the use of roll-ups.
The upgrade could also impact Ethereum's monetary policy by capping new validator entry, which acts to slow the growth of the validator set and, consequently, the rate of new ETH issuance. While reduced issuance suggests a potential decrease in supply, the new blob structure may also lead to fewer transactions on the execution layer, reducing ETH burned, and possibly mitigating the effect of reduced issuance.
All in all, this development continues Ethereum's trend toward slowing the growth of its supply, and executing on the roll-up-centric roadmap. It can be seen that the last four upgrades resulted in a deceleration and even a slight reduction in the ETH supply since the Merge."

Bitcoin prices have pulled back -15.4% from the new $73k ATH, reaching as low as $61k. This price action aligns very closely with the prior 2018-21 cycle.
Several on-chain indicators have flagged an uptick in profit taking events, with over $2.6B in realized profit taken as the market reached resistance.
The overall Bitcoin market has several similarities to prior ATH breakouts, specifically related to distribution pressure by the Long-Term Holder cohort.

The Bitcoin market has taken a breather from the powerful uptrend over the last two weeks, and has corrected and consolidated above $61k. BTC prices pulled back -15.4% from the new $73.1k ATH set on 13-March, trading down to a local low of $61.8k on 20-March, before recovering back to $70k.
If we index price performance (black) since the April 2021 ATH (where we argue bear market sentiment set in), we can see a remarkable similarity to the prior cycle (blue). By both duration and distance from the April 2021 peak, the market is in a near identical spot to December 2020 relative to the 2018-21 cycle.
Live Chart
In our
video report from last week
, we explored how the Bitcoin market had reached several statistically significant levels with respect to Unrealized profit held within the supply. Metrics like MVRV and the AVIV Ratio reached +1 standard deviation from their long-term means.
Past instances have historically been points of interest, where the market finds a degree of resistance, and some investors start to take profits and chips off the table.
Live Chart
As prices traded down from the ATH and to recent low of $61.2k, a total of 2.0M BTC switched from a status of being 'in-profit' to being 'in-loss'. This provides an indication of the volume of coins that have transacted at a new elevated cost basis.
As the market bounced back to $66.5k, around 1.0M coins returned to 'in-profit' status. From these two observations, we can determine that:
Around 1.0M BTC have a cost basis between $61.2k and $66.5k.
Around 1.0M BTC have a cost basis between $66.5k and the ATH at $73.2k.
This is one of the larger 'supply clusters' encountered during pullbacks since the 2022 lows, suggesting an acceleration of on-chain coin volumes over recent months.

Taking Chips Off the Table
A majority of these 2.0M BTC which now have a cost basis above $61.2k have recently changed hands, with the prior owner spending them to lock in a profit. The chart below presents a suite of variants for the SOPR metric which describes this realized profit behavior.
SOPR describes the average realized profit/loss multiple locked in by the cohort considered, and is the 'spent' sibling of MVRV (which is 'unspent', measuring the average unrealized profit/loss). All four variants have pushed to relative highs, with our Entity-Adjusted variant approaching levels seen at the height of the 2021 bull market.
This indicates that the market is accelerating their volume and magnitude of profit taking in spot markets.
Live Chart
As the market reached the $73.2k ATH, over $2.6B in Realized profit was locked in  via on-chain spending. Approximately 40% of this profit taking can be attributed to the Long-Term, Holder cohort, which includes investors divesting from the GBTC Trust.
The remaining $1.56B in Realized profit was locked in by Short-Term Holders, as traders take advantage of the inflowing liquidity and market momentum. Realized profit by both cohorts has reached a similar magnitude to during the 2021 bull market peak.
Live Chart
We can also see the dominance of Long-Term Holders is increasing relative to all profit taking events. This aligns with our prior report (
WoC-11
) where we noted an uptick in LTH spending as the market broke to new ATHs.
This behaviour pattern is typical of all prior Bitcoin cycles which we documented in a prior report;
Following the Smart Money
From this, analysts can start to consider LTHs as an increasingly important cohort when assessing the magnitude of sell-side supply pressure moving forwards.
Live Chart
Finally, we can consult a somewhat attractive chart which plots out supply clusters over time and by coin age. We have highlighted in blue previous breaks to a new ATH price, catalysing a distinct transition towards 'red hot supply'.
These warmer colors indicate that a large proportion of older supply has started to transact, change hands, and be revalued up to the current spot price. We can see that this tends to characterise the 'Euphoria Phase' of prior Bitcoin bull markets, and thus far very similar patterns are playing out.
From this, we can conclude that higher prices tend to active more dormant supply, bringing older illiquid supply back into liquid circulation. This reflects a wealth transfer event, where long-term holders distribute supply for a profit, and satisfy the new inflowing waves of demand.
Live Dashboard
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market has rallied to a new ATH above $73k, triggering an uptick in profit taking events by the Long-Term Holder cohort. The market is currently seeing over $2.6B/day in realized profit, suggesting many investors have started to take chips off the table. This is not atypical market behaviour however, and aligns very closely with market patterns observed during all prior cycle ATH breakouts."

A Rising Tide of Liquidity
Bitcoin‚Äôs price action decisively broke above the previous cycle ATH in early March, triggering a transition into price discovery. As we covered last week (
WoC-13
), this has motivated a significant volume of supply to be spent and take profits.
This results in spent coins generally being revalued from a lower cost-basis, to a higher one. As these coins change hands, we can also consider this to be an injection of fresh demand and liquidity into the asset class.
This mechanic is elegantly expressed by the Realized Cap metric, tracking the cumulative USD liquidity ‚Äòstored‚Äô in the asset the class. The Realized Cap is now at a new ATH value of $540B, and is increasing at an unprecedented rate of over $79B/month.
Live Chart
We can break down the age bands of the Realized Cap using the Realized Cap HODL Wave metric. This tool is particularly useful for distinguishing the distribution of USD denominated wealth held across various age bands.
If we segregate for coin-ages younger than 3 months, we can see a sharp increase over recent months, with these newer investors now owning ~44% of the aggregate network wealth. This uptick in younger coins is a direct result of Long-Term Holders spending their coins at higher prices to satisfy the wave of inflowing demand.
Live Chart
It is typical in prior Bitcoin cycles that an uptick in new demand tends to come alongside an elevated appetite for speculation. This tends to result in increasingly volatile markets, which is characteristic of macro up-trends in prior Bitcoin cycles.
90-day realized volatility has nearly doubled from 28% to 55% since October 2023, which marked the point where Realized Cap inflows started to accelerate higher.
Live Chart
Dormant Supply Reawakens
Following a historical tightness in supply (see
WoC-46-2023
), the divergence between Long and Short-Term Holder supply has started closing. As prices rise, and unrealized profits held by investors increase, it entices Long-Term Holders (LTHs) to part with their holdings.
LTH Supply has declined by -900k BTC since the peak of 14.91M BTC set in Dec 2023, with the GBTC trust outflows responsible for around one third of this (approx. -286k BTC).
Conversely, the Short-Term Holder Supply has increased by +1.121M BTC, absorbing the LTH distribution pressure, as well as acquiring an additional 121k BTC from the secondary market via exchanges.
Note: LTH and STH Supply are displayed here on separate y-axes for ease of visualisation.
Live Workbench
We can supplement this observation by assessing the ratio between the Long and Short-Term Holder supply. Once more, a pronounced decline is visible in all macro up-trends as the dominant investor behavior moves from Long-Term HODLing, towards distribution, profit taking, and speculation.
üí°
A key takeaway from these observations is the distinct phase shift in investor behavior patterns as new market ATHs are reached. The distribution pressure by Long-Term Holders tends to accelerate to satisfy new demand at higher prices.
Whilst the new US ETFs are an important new component of market structure, these trends are visible in on-chain data throughout all prior cycles.
Live Workbench
The chart below breaks down the BTC supply by on-chain cost basis, as well as by Long/Short-Term Holder cohort.
We can see that approximately 1.875M BTC (9.5% of circulating) have been acquired above $60k, with a majority designated by the Short-Term Holder cohort üî¥. This will include new spot buyers, and approximately
508k BTC now held in US Spot ETFs
(excl. GBTC).
Live in Engine Room
We can bolster the aforementioned observations using the Liveliness metric, which describes the aggregate balance of ‚Äòholding time‚Äô stored within the supply.
Liveliness is experiencing a sustained uptick which indicates that in aggregate, the expendature of long-dormant coins is outpacing the accumulation of ‚Äòholding time‚Äô by HODLed coins. This reiterates the thesis that the market has transitioned into a regime where spending and profit taking is now the dominant market mechanic.
Live Chart
Tools for Assessing Uptrends
Analysing markets is always seeking the balance between supply and demand, with two sides to every coin. For example, profit taking by Long-Term Holders is both a measure of sell-side pressure, but also a read on new demand inflows by Short-Term Holders.
Furthermore, with the market trading at or near new ATHs, coins which are realizing a loss, especially those from the STH cohort, are explicitly sourced from buyers who acquired near the ‚Äòlocal top‚Äô.
üìä
Related Dashboard
: Many of the concepts explored in this section relate to our
Analysis Framework for Bitcoin Bull Markets
dashboard.
With this as context, we can use several powerful on-chain metrics to compare the profit and loss taking events of these two key, but fundamentally opposite market cohorts (LTHs and STHs). We will use a set of three core metrics:
Realized Profit and Loss
- Being the total change in the value of spent coins from their original cost basis, to the spot price when they were moved.
Realized Profit/Loss Ratios
- which oscillate around an equilibrium value of 1 in logarithmic scale, and is an ideal tool for spotting market inflection points. An example is where Realized Losses accelerate in an exponential manner during uptrends, increasing from ‚Äònot much‚Äô to ‚Äòsomething meaningful‚Äô (indicating trapped local/global top buyers are starting to panic spend).
Sell-Side Risk Ratio
- being a ratio between total Realized Profit + Realized Loss divided by the Realized Cap. In other words, this metric describes a ratio between total change in coin value (the disturbing force) and the total size of the market (the object being moved).
Starting with Short-Term Holders, we can see that their Profit / Loss ratio remains well within a profit dominated regime, with profit taking outsizing losses by 50x. Regular retests of the equilibrium level of 1.0 suggests that profits are being absorbed, and investors are generally defending their cost basis during corrections.
Live Workbench
We can also see that STH Realized losses spike during dips as local top buyers panic spend on expectations the market may go lower. The magnitude of realized loss is also increasing for each successive correction, which suggests a growth in the volume and size of top buyers for each leg higher.
Live Chart
Next, we will assess the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for STHs to evaluate the relative scale of their profit or loss taking events.
High values
indicate that STHs are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis, and the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium (usually follows a volatile price move).
Low values
indicate that the majority of coins being spent are close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached, and an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range (usually describes a low volatility environment).
Following the rally above $70k, the STH Sell-Side Risk Ratio spiked meaningfully, which typically occurs around market inflection points (global and local). This generally suggests that a new equilibrium has not yet formed, and the metric is correcting sharply as the market corrects and consolidates.
üí°
Hint for Analysts:
Sell-Side Risk Ratios
tend to behave in a similar manner to Realized Volatility and Options Implied Volatility, providing an on-chain measure of volatility.
Live Workbench
Moving onto our assessment of LTHs, we can see their Realized Profit / Loss Ratio has gone exponential and vertical. By definition, this is a result of there being no LTHs in Loss when the market has only recently broken above the last cycles ATH. This is further fuelled by the aformentioned uptick in LTH profit taking.
Live Workbench
Whilst it is quite useful to track the Realized Losses of STHs during up-trends, it is more useful to monitor the Realized Profit of LTHs, as this acts as a key component of distribution pressures. To illustrate this point, we can see that LTH Realized Losses have tailed off to just $3,500 per day, compared to the $114M by STHs during the recent correction.
Live Chart
As LTH Realized Profits accelerate, their Sell-Side Risk Ratio has started to rally, particularly since October 2023. This metric is increasing well in line with historical ATH breaks suggesting that the distribution pressure and profit taking by the LTH cohort are similar to prior cycles on a relative basis.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Across a wide variety on-chain tools and metrics, we can see a distinct shift in investor behavior patterns. Long-Term Holders are well into their distribution cycle, realizing profits, and re-awakening dormant supply to satisfy new demand at higher prices.
Using on-chain cohorts, we can also develop a suite of tools and indicators to identify local and global inflection points, leveraging profit / loss metrics in particular. The combination of LTH and STH cohorts, alongside their profit / loss taking behaviors, provides a relatively unprecedented look into investor psychology, sentiment, and capital flows."

Bitcoin‚Äôs strong performance over the last 12 months is supported by a surge in both spot trade volume but also exchange deposit and withdrawal volumes.
By inspecting the cumulative volume delta (CVD), we can see that a majority of 2023 saw net selling activity on the taker side, even though corrections have been historically mild and less than 20%.
Profit taking by long-term holders spiked meaningfully into the $73k ATH and is cooling down in recent weeks. This comes alongside an uptick in new demand brought on by the US spot ETFs.

It continues to be an impressive year for Bitcoin, with prices consolidating between $64k and $73k over the last week. Bitcoin markets have seen a surge in spot trade volume since the US Spot ETFs went live in early January 2024, with daily volumes peaking at ~$14.1B in mid-March as the market reached the $73k ATH.
This magnitude of spot trade volume is equivalent to the height of the 2020-2021 bull market, although it has started to cool down in recent weeks, currently at $7B/day.
Binance still commands a 37.5% market share in spot markets; however, this dominance is declining relative to the prior cycle. In 2021, Binance accounted for around 50% of trade volume in 2021, but also an incredible 85%+ in the deepest phase of the 2022 bear market.
Live Professional Chart
To assess overall market momentum, we can employ a simple slow/fast-moving average model applied to spot volumes. Here, we compare the 180D-MA (slow) and 30D-MA (fast) to assess whether spot trade volumes are warming up or cooling down.
Price action since October 2023 has seen the faster average trade significantly higher than the slower one, indicating that the YTD performance is supported by strong demand in spot markets. A similar structure is apparent during the 2021 bull run.
Live Professional Workbench
To bolster this observation, we can apply a similar fast/slow momentum indicator to the on-chain transfer volumes deposited üî¥ or withdrawn üü¢ from all exchanges wallets we monitor.
We can see a similar positive momentum signal to what has been in play since July 2023, suggesting the flow of coins in and out of exchanges is also heightened. The monthly average of total Exchange Flows (inflows plus outflows) is currently at $8.19B per day, significantly higher than the peak in the 2020-2021 bull market.
Overall, Bitcoin‚Äôs YTD price action is supported by a significant uptick in spot trade volume, and exchange flows onchain.

Our recent newsletter (
WoC 10
) showcased how the new US Spot ETFs have become a dominant force in the market. These new instruments introduced a significant source of new demand into the market, more than offsetting the daily issuance, as well as sell-side pressure from GBTC and existing holders.
This conclusion can be reinforced by comparing spot trade volumes üüß and ETF trade volumes üü¶. There is strong correlation between these markets, with ETFs trading around 30% of the size of global spot markets. We can also see the seasonality impact of weekends, where ETF markets are closed, and spot trade volumes are notably lower.
Buy Side vs Sell Side Volume
Another tool that enables us to characterise spot markets is the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD). This metric describes the net bias in market taker buy vs sell volume, measured in USD.
Suppose we isolate the major positive peaks üü©, where the taker buy volume minus the taker sell volume exceeds $60M. In that case, we can see a remarkable similarity between market sentiment in Q1-2021 and the post-ETF market.
By mid-March, the spot volume delta reached +$143.6M, which is slightly lower than the peak in February 2021 ($145.2M) but indicates a major shift towards a net buy-side bias. Notably, most of 2023 experienced a net sell-side bias in spot markets despite the fact that markets had minimal pullbacks, and steadily climbed higher.
Live Professional Chart
We can break this Spot CVD metric into individual volume deltas at specific exchanges. The chart below represents the following traces:
Binance
üü®
Coinbase üü¶
All Other Exchanges
üü•
During the 2020-21 bull market, Coinbase and Other Exchanges experienced a net buy-side bias, while Binance saw the sell-side dominate. Much of 2023 saw a net sell-side bias across all exchanges until October, when this flipped into a net buy-side.
One interpretation would be that the significant sell-side bias by takers in 2023 was met with a comparatively larger bid on the maker side. This patient buy side throughout last year could be a key reason for the relatively light pullbacks (max -20%) seen since the FTX lows (stay tuned for a chart showing this later in this report).

Navigating The Cycle
We have established that the strong performance of Bitcoin over the last 12-18 months is supported by a meaningful uptick in trade volumes. Next, we will explore charts that can help us navigate the market cycle during price discovery.
A vital tool for mapping bitcoin cycles is the Supply Profitability State, which considers the percentage of the total coin supply which are held in profit. The chart below represents the Percentage of Supply in Profit alongside two statistical bands, set at +1 SD üü¢ and -1 SD üî¥.
Periods when supply in profit trades above +1SD (~95% in profit) are naturally aligned with the market rallying towards the prior cycle ATH (Pre-Euphoria), as well as breaking beyond it (Euphoria).
We can see a common pattern in this tool in the prior cycle, where an initial Pre-Euphoria rally tests the upper band and puts a super-majority of coins into profit. After a period of correction and consolidation, the market finally rallies up to and through the prior ATH, driving the oscillator well above 95% in profit status.
Live Advanced Workbench
As a result, the unrealized profit held by market participants increases significantly. This of course, creates a growing incentive for investors to ramp up profit-taking (realizing profit). The following chart shows the weekly sum volume Realized Profit, normalized by market cap to compare across cycles üü©.
As the market reclaimed the 2021 cycle high, this metric peaked at 1.8%, suggesting 1.8% of the market cap was locked in as profit over a 7-day period. This is significant but remains comparatively lower than the profit-taking intensity during the January 2021 rally (3.0%.)
In terms of market mechanics, this dynamic provides us with a few pieces of information:
Profit-taking, typically by long-term holders, tends to ramp up around ATH breaks.
Local and global market peaks are often established after major profit-taking events.
Profit taken by one investor is matched by inflowing demand from the buying party on the other side. This gives us an insight into the magnitude of new capital flowing into Bitcoin.
Live Advanced Chart
If we return to the magnitude of drawdowns we alluded to earlier, we can see that despite the large-scale profit taking by existing holders, the magnitude of pullbacks remains historically small.
If we compare the ATH break in prior cycles, it could be argued that current Euphoria phase (market in price discovery) is still relatively young. Previous Euphoria phases have seen numerous price drawdowns exceeding -10%, with the majority being much deeper, with 25%+ being commonplace.
The current market has seen just two ~10%+ corrections since the ATH was broken.
Live Standard Workbench
An Influx of New Investors
There are always two sides to a market; for every investor taking profits, another investor acquires those coins at a higher cost. We can visualise this influx of new investors by the rising share of wealth held by coins younger than 6-months in the Realized Cap HODL Waves.
During the last two bull markets, the aggregate share of < 6-month-old wealth reached between 84% and 95%, indicating a saturation of newer holders. This metric has increased dramatically since early 2023, rising from 20% on 1-Jan-2023 to 47% today.
This suggests that the capital held within the Bitcoin holder base is roughly balanced between long-term holders and new demand.
Live Advanced Chart
This also means that analysts should start to pay more attention to the behaviour of these new investors as their share of the capital increases.
By definition, there are no Long-Term Holders with coins held at a loss shortly after a new ATH break (at least 155 days after the event). As such, Short-Term Holders (STHs) will dominate all onchain metrics describing supply or volume ‚Äòin-loss‚Äô. Accordingly, STH now represents ~100% of the Total Realized Losses on spent coins üî¥.
If we consider this ‚ÄòSTH Loss Dominance‚Äô across prior cycles, we can see that this condition has lasted for between 6.5 and 13.5 months until the bear market sets in. The current market has only entered this condition for around 1-month so far.
Live Professional Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The strong market performance of Bitcoin over the last 12 months is supported by a remarkable uptick in both spot trade volumes and onchain flows associated with exchanges. By analysing the Cumulative Volume Delta, we can also gauge that the demand side has been remarkably strong, albeit with bids patiently taking the maker side rather than the taker side.
With the market now above the 2021 ATH, profit-taking has ramped up but is cooling down in recent weeks. The balance of wealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the ‚ÄòEuphoria‚Äô phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective."

The Ethereum community is currently engaged in a heated debate regarding the ETH monetary policy following proposals to reduce the ETH issuance rate.
New innovations such as Liquid Staking, Restaking, and Liquid Restaking have introduced additional yield opportunities, significantly boosting staking demand.
Concerns are that the increasing prevalence of staking derivatives may dilute Ethereum's function as money, and shift the governance power of the network.
This weekend saw an uptick in geopolitical tension in the Middle East, culminating in drone attacks on Israel last Saturday. Given cryptocurrency markets are the only assets that trade over weekends, this triggered a notable downturn in digital asset markets. BTC fell by -8%, while ETH prices declined by -13%. Markets recovered slightly, but have continued trading sideways to downward, with investors cautious of longer term impacts.
In the Ethereum ecosystem, there has also been a significant ongoing debate regarding potential changes to its issuance rate. This discussion was sparked when proposals from two Ethereum researchers were made, suggesting to slow ETH issuance, and hence reduce staking rewards.
The overarching aim is to reduce the growth of the staking pool, in a bid to manage the rising dominance of new innovations such as Liquid Staking and Restaking, and protect Ethereum's function as money.
Staking on Ethereum has experienced unexpectedly high demand, with the amount of ETH actively participating in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake currently stands at 31.4M ETH (~26% of the total supply). We can see that the growth rate of staked ETH is picking up in recent months. This is particularly following the introduction of new innovations such as the Eigenlayer Restaking protocol in June 2023, and the Liquid Restaking protocols in early 2024.
Live Advanced Chart
Distorted Incentives
Originally, the Proof-of-Stake protocol was designed such that as more ETH is staked, the marginal revenue for each validator declines. This mechanism self-regulates the size of the staking pool, and with 31.4M ETH currently staked, the estimated annual APY per validator stands at around 3.2%.
Live Advanced Chart
However, new developments such as yield sourced from MEV, Liquid Staking, Restaking, and Liquid Restaking have introduced additional opportunities. As a result, the incentive and demand for users to stake is increasing beyond the original vision.
If we categorise staked deposits by their origin, it reveals a notable increase in ETH staked by Liquid Restaking providers since the beginning of the year. These protocols now account for 27% of newly staked ETH, whilst new deposits by Liquid Staking providers have dwindled since mid-March.
Restaking was introduced last year by the protocol EigenLayer. EigenLayer enables users to deposit their staked ETH or Liquid Staking Tokens into EigenLayer smart contracts. These assets can then be used as security collateral by other services such as rollups, oracles, and bridges. Restakers earn additional fees from these services, in addition to their native staking yield from the Ethereum mainchain.
Staking on Eigenlayer has surged since the protocol's launch, with the total value locked (TVL) now over 14.2M ETH (~$13B). These high levels of demand for restaking is also partly due to the anticipation of an Eigenlayer airdrop campaign.
Over 61.1% of Eigenlayer's TVL comes from native staked ETH, while the remainder is made up of Liquid Staking Tokens, with Lido's stETH leading the pack, making up for 21.5% of the total TVL.
The Rise of Liquid Restaking
Liquid Restaking operates much like Liquid Staking, allowing users to restake their tokens and receive a liquid representation of their restaked assets in return. This is an option that seems to be preferred by Eigenlayer users, with 63% of deposits into Eigenlayer made through Liquid Restaking providers.
Researchers at the Ethereum Foundation have raised concerns about the high and growing staking rate. Whilst staking more ETH yields a lower reward rate per validator, the total rewards paid out may still contribute to inflation if the total amount of staked ETH becomes substantial. Currently around 1.01% of the total ETH supply consist of newly issued tokens since The Merge, although this is offset by ~3.55% of the supply burned over the same time.
Live Advance Chart
As more ETH moves into staking pools, the impacts of inflation starts to impacts an increasingly small number of ETH holders. In other words, there is a wealth transfer taking place from a shrinking pool of non-staked ETH holders, towards a growing pool of staked ETH holders.
Over time, this 'real yield' component risks making holding ETH less appealing, and could erode ETH's function as a monetary asset within the Ethereum ecosystem. Instead, the role of 'money' could migrate towards Liquid Staking Tokens like stETH, or even to Liquid Restaking Tokens, which function as supercharged yield-bearing instrument. A side-effect of such a development would be the projects which issue these derivative tokens gaining an outsized influence over the governance and stability of Ethereum's execution and consensus layers.
Today, we already note that half of the staked ETH is provided through those derivative projects. 42% of the staked ETH is re-liquified by Liquid Staking Tokens, and an additional 8% through Liquid Restaking derivatives.
The Ethereum researcher;s concern that also applies to Ethereum's moneyness. Of the total ETH supply, 11% is held in Liquid Staking Tokens and 2.2% in Liquid Restaking Tokens.
The proposals made by the Ethereum Foundation aim to limit and constrain annual issuance, thus reducing the incentives for new stakers to enter the pool, and hopefully slowing staking growth rates.. The proposals have received significant pushback from the community, with many arguing that no change is currently necessary, and challenging the need to update the ETH monetary policy once again.
However, he growth of the staking pool was already constrained slightly during the last Decun upgrade. The hardfork introduced a limit of 8 new validators per 6.4-minute epoch, and replaced the churn limit function. This effectively capped the number of validators and the amount of stake that can enter the staking pool, providing very mild relief for the time being.
Summary and Conclusion
The Ethereum ecosystem is debating proposed changes the ETH issuance rate, aimed at slowing down the expansion of the staking pool. The goal is to mitigate the influence of innovations like Liquid Staking and Restaking, which are acting to enhance the yield opportunities, and thus demand from users.
The surge in staking‚Äînow at 31.4M ETH or roughly 26% of the total supply‚Äîhas been driven by Restaking protocols like Eigenlayer. These developments are increasingly leading to the proliferation of of liquid staking tokens, which over the long-term may start to undermine Ethereum's role as a money asset. The Ethereum Foundation has suggested capping annual issuance to slow the growth of the staking pool, however these proposals have been met with significant resistance from the community."

The Fourth Bitcoin Halving has occurred, reducing the annualized inflation rate of the Bitcoin Supply by 50%, and decisively surpassing Gold in terms of issuance scarcity.
When measuring across Halving Epochs, diminishing growth rates are noted across multiple network statistics, whilst the absolute value of these measures continues to climb to new ATHs.
Investor profitability has been bolstered by a rising spot price and a decisive ATH break, which has dampened the 50% reduction in revenue for miners relative to the start of the year.

A Disinflationary Supply
The Bitcoin supply curve is deterministic due to the ingenious mining algorithm called the Difficulty Adjustment. This protocol adjusts the difficulty of the Bitcoin mining process such that no matter how few, or how many mining rigs are applied, the average block interval remains anchored at around 600-seconds (10mins).
Every 210,000 blocks (roughly a 4 year time period), a pre-determined reduction in issuance occurs, reducing the newly minted BTC coins by 50%. The fourth Bitcoin Halving took place over the weekend, seeing the block subsidy decline from 6.25BTC to 3.125BTC per block, or an approximate issuance of 450 BTC per day (for 144 blocks mined).
Live Chart
Entering the Fourth Epoch, 19,687,500 BTC has been mined and issued, equivalent to 93.75% of the terminal supply of 21M BTC. Thus there remains only 1,312,500 BTC to issued over the next 126 years, with 656,600 (3.125%) being issued across our current Epoch. Interestingly, each halving represents a point where:
The percent of supply remaining equals the new block subsidy (3.125 BTC/block vs 3.125% remaining).
50% of the remaining supply (1.3125M BTC) will be mined between the fourth and fifth halving.
Live Workbench
With the block subsidy halving every 210,000 blocks, the inflation rate is also halved roughly every 4 years. This puts the new annualized inflation rate of the Bitcoin supply at a value of 0.85%, down from 1.7% in the prior epoch.
The fourth halving also marks a significant milestone in the comparison of Bitcoin to Gold as for the first time in history, Bitcoin‚Äôs steady-state issuance rate (0.83%) becomes lower than Gold (~2.3%), marking a historic handover in the title of scarcest asset.
Keeping Perspective
It is important however to keep the scale of the halving in perspective. When assessing the relative impact of the halving on market dynamics, the volume of freshly minted coins does remain very small compared to the global trade volume within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Issuance is a fraction of the on-chain transfer volumes, spot volume and derivatives volume we see today, and is currently equivalent to less than 0.1% of the aggregate capital moved and traded on any given day.
Thus the impact that Bitcoin halvings have on the available traded supply is diminishing across cycles, not only due to the reduction in mined coins, but also as the size of the asset and ecosystem expand around it.
Live Workbench
Grounding Expectations
The Halving is an important and well publicised event, naturally leading to heightened speculation around its impact on price action. It can be a useful to balance our expectations against historical precedence, and create loose boundaries based upon past performance.
The price performance of Bitcoin across various halving epochs has a very wide spread, and we argue the earlier epochs are too different to today to be much of a guide. We do see both a diminishing returns, and shallower total drawdown effect over time, which is a natural result of the growing market size, and the scale of capital flows required to move it.
üî¥ Epoch 2 Price Performance: +5315% with a max drawdown of -85%
üîµ Epoch 3 Price Performance: +1336% with a max drawdown of -83%
üü¢ Epoch 4 Price Performance: +569% with a max drawdown of -77%
Live Workbench
Assessing the price performance since the cycle low up until the Halving, we note a stark similarity between the 2015, 2018 and our current cycle, all experiencing an increase of around ~200% to ~300%.
However, our current cycle has been the only one on record to decisively break the previous ATH before the halving event.
Live Workbench
Another lens is to check market performance is in the 365-days following each halving. Epoch 2 saw a substantially larger performance, but we must consider that the dynamics and landscape of the market today has evolved significantly relative to the 2011-2013 period.
Therefore, the two most recent Epochs (3 and 4) provide a more informative depiction of the impact of asset size.
üî¥ Epoch 2 Price Performance: +7,258% with a max drawdown of -69.4%
üîµ Epoch 3 Price Performance: +293% with a max drawdown of -29.6%
üü¢ Epoch 4 Price Performance: +266% with a max drawdown of -45.6%
Whilst the year following a halving event is historically strong, it has come with some serious gut-check drawdowns along the way, ranging from -30% to -70%.

History Rhymes, Sometimes
During the bear market of 2022, a common narrative was that prices would never drop below the previous cycle ATH ($20k set in 2017 at the time). This was of course invalidated as prices collapsed more than 25% below the 2017 cycle high during the widespread deleveraging in late 2022.
A similar narrative circulated of late that prices could not break to a new the ATH before the halving had occurred. Once again, this was invalided in March this year. The ATH we saw in March comes off the back of both a historically tight supply (
WoC-46-2023
), and the remarkable demand interest brought online via the new spot ETFs.
Live Workbench
This price increase has also had meaningful effects on the unrealized profit held by investors. Currently, unrealized profit held within the coin supply is the largest it has ever been moving into a Halving event (as measured by MVRV).
In other words, investors are holding the largest paper gains relative to their cost basis as of a halving date. With the MVRV Ratio is trading at 2.26, this means the average unit of BTC is holding a +126% paper gain.

Fundamental Growth
In the previous section we assessed historical price performance centred around the Halving. In the next section, we will shift our focus to the growth of network fundamentals, ranging from mining security, miner revenues, asset liquidity and settlement volumes over halving epochs.
Hashrate is a network statistic for evaluating the collective ‚Äòfirepower‚Äô of the mining cohort. Across halving epochs, the rate of growth in hashrate has slowed, however the absolute Hashes per second continues to expand, now at 620 Exahash per second (equivalent to all 8-billion people on earth completing 77.5-billion hashes every second).
Interestingly, hashrate has been at or near a new ATHs entering each halving event, which suggests two scenarios could be occurring;
More ASIC rigs are coming online and/or,
More efficient hashing ASIC hardware is being produced.
The conclusion drawn from both of these scenarios is that despite issuance being reduced by 50% each halving, the aggregate security budget has been sufficient not only to sustain current OPEX costs, but also to stimulate further investment across both the CAPEX and OPEX domains.

Miner revenues are similarly seeing a diminishing growth rate when denominated in USD, but a net expansion in absolute size. Cumulative miner revenue topped a staggering $3B over the past four years, increasing by an order of magnitude over the prior Epoch.

The Realized Cap is a powerful tool to measure the capital invested and stored within Bitcoin over time, and can be used to compare USD denominated liquidity growth across cycles.
A net total of $560B worth of USD value has been ‚Äòstored‚Äô within Bitcoin by this measure. The realized cap increased by 439% over the last epoch, which supports the now $1.4 trillion dollar market cap of the asset. It is also noteworthy that Bitcoin continues to see capital inflows despite the infamous volatility, bad headlines, and cyclical drawdowns.
Live Workbench
Finally, if we evaluate transfer volumes settled across halving epochs, we can see that over the last four years, a staggering $106T worth of economic value was transferred and settled by the network. Now it is important to note that this is considering raw unfiltered volumes, and does not adjust for internal wallet management.
Nevertheless, each transaction was settled without intermediaries, and highlights the incredible value throughput capacity of the Bitcoin network at scale.
Live Workbench
Conclusions and Summary
With the highly anticipated Halving complete, the issuance emission per block has been halved and the scarcity of the asset hardened, with the Bitcoin asset decisively overtaking gold in terms of issuance scarcity.
Comparing across Epochs, a contraction in growth can be noted across Hashrate, Network Settlemend, Liquidity and Miner Revenue. However, the absoloute value of these metrics has increased by an order of magnitude, an incredibly impressive feat when observed in relation to the size of the market.
Of note, network profitability across all walks of market investors has largely imrproved in relation to previous Halvings. This includes the fundamental Miner class, who have entered the Halving with an ATH in Hashrate, suggesting a sufficient security budget to stimulate OpEx and CapEx requirements."

Distribution in Fear
The Bitcoin market is still consolidating in the mid-$60k range, where prices have been constrained since the $73k ATH was reached in mid-March. In this edition, we will assess whether the behavior of investors during this consolidation is more heavily weighted towards distribution, or accumulation patterns.
First, we will employ the
Accumulation Trend Score
to illustrate how investor accumulation patterns have shaped local tops and bottoms since the FTX crash.
During the early stages of both the 2020-21 and 2023-24 bull runs, we can see a confluence between local regimes of distribution (light colours) and intervals of price contraction. As the market rallies to new highs, sell pressure is re-activated, as investors bring dormant supply back into the market to satisfy the inflowing demand.
As spot price reached new ATHs in mid-March, the same pattern of local distribution occurred, which was intensified as news around the conflict in the Middle East broke, causing a correction to $60.3k.
Live Advanced Chart
If we inspect the breakdown of this metric by wallet sizes, we can complete a more detailed assessment. Here we see a distinct uptick in net outflows üü• across all cohorts throughout April, suggesting a consistent sell-side pressure across the board.

Unrealized Pain & Gain Cycles
A unique characteristic of the prevailing bull market has been the positive effect of US Spot ETF momentum on price action. The impact the ETFs have had on investor behavior can be explained via the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric, which measures the magnitude of net paper profits (or losses) held by the market (normalized by the market cap).
Using NUPL, we can identify the classic Euphoria phase of a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half the market capitalization size (NUPL > 0.5).
In the 2020-21 cycle, this phase was triggered 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving, and saw sustained upside for almost 10.5 months afterwards. However, in this cycle, NUPL breached 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the halving. This distinct shift highlights the significance of US ETF in shaping and accelerating price action by introducing powerful demand into the market.
Live Advanced Chart
By this metric, the Euphoria phase (NUPL>0.5) of this bull market has been in effect for last 7 months. Even the mightiest up-trends experience corrections however, and these events offer valuable information about investor positioning and sentiment.
To dive into the dynamics of bull market corrections, we have used two conditions.
Relative Unrealized Profit üü¢> 0.5
, showing the market is broadly shouldering a large magnitude of paper gains.
Relative Unrealized Loss üî¥ > 0.01
, meaning investors are experiencing significant financial pressure, holding large unrealized losses during the market correction
As shown in the following charts, these correction events are common and expected during all bull markets. Since touching the ATH at $73.1k, this structure has appeared across three separate retraces down to ~$60k zone.

Navigating Local Bottoms
Having confirmed that we are within the Euphoria zone, and with an expectation of corrections, the next part of this report focuses on building a compass for navigating these contractions when they happen.
The first step is to identify the aggressive side of the market during a correction, which we define as the cohort contributing the most to the duration and depth of each pullback.
We can use the Realized Loss breakdown metric (denominated in USD) to identify that short-term holders (recent buyers) are displaying a marked dominance at the moment.
Live Professional Chart
Having established that Short-Term Holders in Loss is a cohort of interest, we will use Glassnode‚Äôs new Breakdown metric suite to dissect the cost basis of these recent buyers.
Among these younger age bands, the cost basis of 1m-3m üü† and 3m-6m üü° cohorts emerge as valuable tools for distinguishing the bull and bear market structures. The 1w-1m üî¥ cost basis, however, has shown to correspond with market inflection points, helping us spot potential local bottoms (in bull markets) and local tops (in bear markets).
Live Professional Chart
The spot Price frequently reacts to the 1w-1m cost basis, which is an idea we initially explored in our
research article
on short-term holder and long-term behavioural analysis. This is due to recent buyers being more price sensitive and having a higher probability of spending in the short term.
Therefore, during bull market corrections, short-term holders tend to ramp up their spending as the market starts to sell-off. As the market price approaches each sub-cohort's cost basis, their pace of spending can be anticipated to slow down (seller exhaustion).
Here, we have chosen the 1w-1m realized price (cost-basis) as a compass for identifying points of potential seller exhaustion in the near-term.
Live Professional Chart
We can use the ratio between the spot price and each cohort cost basis via the MVRV ratio to gauge the typical deviations during corrections.
The following chart shows that the MVRV (1w-1m) ratio usually drops into the 0.9-1 range during the bull market pullbacks. This means the market typically falls 0% to -10% below the 1w-1m investors' average cost basis.
Live Professional Workbench
Having now sized up the implied pressure on 1w-1m investors, we can directly trace the intensity of their panic and fear (measured via realized loss). Our approach is to highlight regimes of aggressive selling pressure by the subgroup of investors in question.
Here, we have presented the realized loss by 1w-1m old entities, denominated in USD. Next, we have identified points of high-loss realization intervals using some simple statistical means ( > 1 standard deviation).
Note that realized loss for this group tends to peak near local market lows, as recent buyers panic sell their coins.
Live Professional Workbench
If we combine both of these conditions we described above, we can formulate a conditional toolkit for spotting potential local low inflection points:
MVRV (1m-1w) is below 1, but above 0.9 and,
Realized Loss (1w-1m) exceeds +1sd on a 90-day window
We now have a compass to uncover structures where the short-term holders potentially reach seller exhaustion.
At the time of writing, the cost basis of 1w-1m holders is $66.7k, while their realized loss has surpassed the 90-day +1sd level on multiple occasions since mid-March. Since the price resides within the $60k to $66.7k range, the MVRV condition is met, and it could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation. That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.
Live Professional Workbench
Conclusions and Summary
In this piece, we established that the Bitcoin market transitioned into a regime of widespread net distribution since the March ATH at $73k. The NUPL metric indicates we are within a Euphoria phase, however it has cooled off meaningfully since the correction started.
Corrections offer valuable information regarding the sentiment and sell-side activity of investors. We derived an example procedure for identifying a sub-set of Short-Term Holders who are influencing the market with the greatest sell-side activity. From this, we developed some simple rules using Glassnode‚Äôs new Breakdown metric suite, which may help in identifying that seller exhaustion within this cohort is becoming a factor at local lows."

The Fourth Bitcoin Halving initially led to a sell-off, with BTC prices falling to $57k before recovering swiftly. This is now the deepest pullback since the FTX lows.
Ethereum exhibited similar price performance, experiencing its maximum drawdown of this cycle which was twice as severe as Bitcoin's.
Ethereum's under-performance this cycle relative to Bitcoin is reflected in a measurable lag in speculative interest from the Short-Term Holder cohort.
Both assets still have a relatively low Realized Cap associated with Long-Term Holders, suggesting the market is likely within the early stages of a macro uptrend.

Price Performance
Bitcoin halving events are well publicised in advance, and have historically been a choppy sell-the-news event in the immediate term. The fourth halving was no exception, with the BTC price selling off by -11%, and trading into the $57k region. This is the lowest price over the last 2 months, although the market has recovered to be flat since the halving date.
Strangely enough, both of the prior two halving cycles saw price flat after two weeks, with only the first halving seeing an +11% gain. In general, the 60-days after halving events tend to be choppy, sideways, with a slight downwards drift to the of around of -5% to -15%.

Live Workbench
Measured from the $73k ATH, Bitcoin prices corrected by -20.3%, which is the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows in Nov-2022. That said, this macro uptrend still appears to be one of the more resilient in history, with comparatively shallow corrections thus far.
Of note, we can also observe a strikingly similarity in drawdown structure between our current cycle, and the 2015-17 Bull Market (blue). The 2015-17 uptrend occurred during Bitcoin‚Äôs infancy, with no derivative instruments available for the asset class. As such, this rally was entirely a spot driven market, which perhaps gives some indication that the current market structure may bear some similarities.
A great deal of the leverage from the 2020-22 cycle was washed out in 2022, and the new US ETFs have added a non-trivial new vector for demand in spot markets.
Live Workbench
For Ethereum, we can see a similar drawdown structure, with notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows. This hits to a degree of resilience during pullbacks, as well as a net reduction in volatility across the digital asset space.
However, it is worth noting that Ethereum's deepest drawdown of the cycle has been -44%, which is just over twice as severe as Bitcoin‚Äôs at -21%. This highlights Ethereum's relative under-performance over last 2 years, which is manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio also.
Live Workbench
Investor Positioning
In order to compare relative performance between BTC and ETH, we can turn to the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric. Comparing NUPL allows us to see how the profitability of BTC vs ETH investors has fared relative to the average on-chain cost basis for each asset.
A major threshold for this indicator is NUPL > 0.5, which generally aligns with the breaking to new ATHs, and the beginning of the Euphoria phase. A NUPL value above 0.5 signifies that the unrealized profit held by investors exceeds 50% of the asset market cap value.
Amidst the hype and market rally surrounding approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the unrealized profit of Bitcoin holders expanded considerably faster than that of Ethereum investors. As a result, the Bitcoin NUPL metric crossed 0.5 and entered the euphoria phase three months before than equivalent metric for Ethereum.
Live Workbench
The Short-Term Holder cohort consists of investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days, and are often considered a proxy for new investor demand. Typically, the average acquisition price of the cohort has acted as strong resistance during bearish trends, and a region of support during bullish trends.
This thesis has held up so far this week, with the Bitcoin market correcting down below the STH-Cost Basis at $59.8k, where it found support and rallied higher. Historically speaking, retests of the STH Cost Basis are common during up-trends, and provide a key level for monitoring potential inflection points should it fail to hold.
Live Workbench
We can assess the STH Cost Basis for Ethereum as well, which has provided support on several occasions in this uptrend already. Ethereum's STH-MVRV is trading at a very slight premium at the moment, which could suggest that spot prices are very close to the cost basis of recent buyers, who may panic should the market experience downside volatility.

A Growing Divergence
In the run-up to Bitcoin's all-time high (ATH) on 14-March, there was a noticeable increase in speculative activity. Specifically, capital accumulation has been observed among short-term holders, with the USD wealth held withing coins moved within the last 6 months approaching $240B, near ATHs.
Live Workbench Chart
However, this trend has not been mirrored for ETH, which has not yet seen price break above the 2021 ATH yet. Whilst Bitcoin's STH-Realized Cap is nearly on par with the last bull run peak, ETH's STH-Realized Cap has barely lifted off the lows, suggesting a markedly lacklustre inflow of new capital.
In many ways, this lack of new capital inflows is a reflection of the under-performance of ETH relative to BTC. This is likely in part due to the attention and access brought about by the spot Bitcoin ETFs.
The market is still awaiting the SEC's decision for approval of a suite of ETH ETFs expected towards the end of May.
Live Workbench Chart
We can take a similar analysis approach related to the Long-Term Holders, were we notice a significant decline taking place within the 2 to 3-year cohort. Some portion of this are coins acquired 3yrs ago (May 2021) maturing into the 3y-5y age band, but the rest an indication of profit taking an divestment.
This was likely influenced by the approval of the ETFs, with a significant proportion of this divestment occurring in February 2024, as the market rallied, and was about a month prior to BTC reaching its current $73k ATH. These Long-Term Holders historically wait for strong demand inflows to take profits into market strength.
Live Workbench Chart
For Ethereum, we continue to see ongoing HODLing behaviour, particularly in the 1 to 3-year cohorts. It appears that due to ETH's current under-performance, seasoned investors are sitting back and waiting patiently for higher prices.
Live Workbench Chart
If we examine the Spent Volume in Profit for LTHs, we can see that the cohort of BTC holders who have held for between 6 months and 2 years increased their divestment during the ATH rally.

From this lens, Ethereum's Long-Term Holders once again appear to still be waiting for better profit-taking opportunities.

As we established in
WoC 08
, capital inflows into ETH do tend to lag relative to BTC. In the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into BTC occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ETH. We can monitor the rotation of capital between these two assets via an assessment of the 30-day change in the Realized Cap.
In this instance, we have broken down this metric by Short and Long-Term Holders. For both assets, the Short-Term Holder variant peaked before the 2021 cycle top across both assets. This year, the BTC short-term holder Realized Cap has peaked around the new all-time high, whilst the ETH metric has hardly moved higher.
Live Workbench Chart
For the Long-Term Holder variant, both assets saw a relative maximum around the second cycle top. This is a very different interpretation, as it takes at least 155-days for capital to reach LTH status.
As such, this metric is describing top buyers from Q1 2021, who first acquired BTC, and then later in ETH, and who held onto their supply into the Oct-Nov 2021 peak. These buyers were likely the ones who weathered, and contributed to sell-side pressure throughout the 2022 bear market that followed.

Summary and Conclusion
Market action around the fourth Bitcoin halving was remarkably similar to prior cycles, with a temporary price drop to $57k, before rebounding to be flat overall. Ethereum markets followed a similar trajectory, however several metrics provided color to ETHs under-performance relative to BTC.
When we break down capital flows and rotation between BTC and ETH, we can see that Bitcoin has received the lions share of inflows, likely driven in part by the US spot ETFs. Short-Term Holders and speculation activity appears concentrated within Bitcoin, with a remarkably weak spill-over into Ethereum thus far."
2024,20,2024-W20,2024-05-13,2024-05-19,Bearish,62932.37,66261.62,65171.56,5.29,Disagree,"Executive Summary:
During a Bull Market regime, long-term investors are generally highly profitable. Therefore, the dominant source of realized loss originates from the Short-Term Holder cohort, which can provide information on inflection points during sell-off events.
Given that market inflection points unfold from the inside-out, we produce a framework using our newly released Breakdown by Age metrics to profile seller exhaustion across day trader and weekly-monthly investor cohorts.
Within this framework, we utilize onchain metrics to assess both the unrealized and realized losses of the targeted investor classes as a gauge for their response to market downturns.
Establishing a Seller Exhaustion Framework
When evaluating a Bitcoin bull market over a macro timeframe, price action can be broadly characterised by elevated volatility to the upside, with corrections and consolidations along the way. All investors are aware that financial markets do not move upwards only over time, and which creates the sort of cat-and-mouse game between supply and demand which creates local and global correction events.
We will start by assessing the Realized Loss for both Long and Short-Term Holders. We can observe that losses taken by LTHs üîµ almost exclusively occur around macro cycle downturns. Conversely, losses are locked in by recent buyers throughout all phases of the market, and are typically the dominant source of loss during bull market.
Live Chart
In this report, we will take advantage of the fact that the Short-Term Holder cohort is the dominant group locking in losses, and use this to identify periods of seller exhaustion. The goal is to identify inflection points during corrections and consolidations within a dominant bull trend.
Here, we define Seller Exhaustion as a point of oversold conditions, where a majority of the sellers who are likely to sell, and done so. Since every seller is matched with a buyer, we can simultaneously gauge periods when this sell-side is absorbed by an influx of buy-side demand, which helps establish a local bottom.
Inflection points in market trends tend to reverberate upwards from smaller timeframes (minutes to hours) through to larger timeframes (days to months). In order to capture this effect, we will utilize our newly released age breakdown metrics to isolate two distinct sets of investors from within the STH cohort:
Daily Traders [24hr Cohort]
Weekly-Monthly Swing Traders [1d-1m Cohort]
In order to model points of extreme financial pressure and reaction, we call upon three profit/loss metrics which help us establish the severity of the pressure investors are experiencing.
MVRV Ratio
which assesses the unrealized profit or loss held by investors within the cohort.
SOPR
which evaluates the average magnitude of profit or loss locked in by the cohort.
Realized Loss
which isolates the USD denominated magnitude loss locked in by the cohort.
üí°

The Week On-chain Dashboard
.
Daily Traders
Initially, we start with an assessment of the Daily Trader group, and utilize the 24hr age breakdown.
This is inherently the fastest moving cohort, and the most sensitive to the spot price, reacting near instantaneously to any and all fluctuations in price action. Thus, this cohort will produce a large amount of seller exhaustion signals, but with a larger proportion of noise due to the erratic nature of the selected timeframe.
Live Workbench
First, we evaluate the MVRV Z-Score (with a 90 data point look-back period) for the Day Trader cohort. We can see this metric consistently flips from high to low values as a result of the intraday volatility of price, which then impacts the unrealized profit/loss held by this cohort.
Since we are looking for seller exhaustion signals during a correction, we isolate points when the MVRV Z-Score trades more than -1œÉ below the mean. These are points of heightened unrealized loss, and points of statistically significant pressure placed upon Day Traders.
Live Workbench
Next, we shall incorporate the SOPR metric to assess whether the unrealized financial pressure was acted upon, and whether those losses were crystallized, or not. Again, we isolate for Z-Score values more than -1œÉ below the mean, which identifies periods of micro-capitulation, and large sell-side pressure.
Live Workbench
Finally, we can bolster the above observations by assessing the USD denominated realized loss locked in by the Day Trader cohort. Here, we are evaluating the absolute magnitude of the sell-side pressure. Keeping consistency, and applying a similar Z-Score framework to 24hr realized losses, we are able to confirm periods of micro-capitulation, indicated when values are 2œÉ above the mean.
Live Workbench
Weekly-Monthly Traders
Moving onto the Weekly-Monthly traders, we first observe that the oscillation within the signal has slowed noticeably. This is the expected result as we expand up to longer term age bands, which smooths out the average cost basis. This cohort is less price sensitive than the Day Trader group, however they are also more likely to experience volatility as the spot price fluctuates around their cost basis during their holding time.
Live Workbench
Investigating the 1d-1m MVRV Z-Scores, we can see that this variant is less responsive to price action compared to the 24hr variant. As a result, this MVRV variant is slower to move, generates fewer signals overall, but also has less noise overall.
The chart below highlights when the MVRV Z-Score trades below the mean (negative Z-Score values), as an indicator that significant unrealized losses have transferred up to the larger 1d-1m age band.
Live Workbench
Again, we use the SOPR Ratio Z-Score to confirm whether these investors are under sufficient pressure to capitulate and lock in those losses. Similar to the MVRV Ratio Z-Score, we isolate points when the Z-Score trades below the mean. This provides a degree of confluence that realized losses are starting to reverberate from smaller to larger timeframes.
Live Workbench
Lastly, we can establish one final layer of confluence using the with the Realized Loss Z-Score. In this instance, we distinguish for Z-Score values trading +2œÉ above the mean to confirm a significant USD denominated loss has been locked in by the Weekly-Monthly swing trader cohort.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
On-chain data provides analysts and investors with a remarkable degree of transparency into the positioning, incentives, and actions of various market participants. We can use these tools to build models and tools for assessing how investor behavior changes in response to price action.
Utilizing our newly released breakdown metrics, we are able to isolate individual subsets of investors using the heuristic of age bands, as a proxy for their holding time. We then use confluence across three onchain metrics describing the profitability of these investor groups to identify points of micro-capitulation, which tend to accompany local market lows.
This framework helps us think about what incentives and actions we would expect to see when identifying points of seller exhaustion."

Following a significant period of distribution into the ATH, a period of cooling down and consolidation has been underway, and sell-side pressure is winding back markedly.
Alongside lighter sell-side activity, capital inflows remain relatively modest, although remain in a profit dominated regime and have been sufficient to stimulate local price action.
Various measures of volatility have compressed over the course of this correction, which usually precede a larger scale market move, since equilibrium has been reached on-chain.

Supply Side Slows
Strong Bitcoin markets naturally attract sell-side pressure, as higher prices motivate long-term holders to distribute some portion of their holdings. We can see this via the large decline in the Supply Last Active 1y and 2y throughout March and April, as longer-term investor cohorts distributed coins to satisfy new demand in the run up to the ATH.
However, the supply held by the 3y+ cohort continues to increase, suggesting this cohort are generally waiting for higher prices before parting ways with their coins. As of the time of writing, more than half of the Bitcoin coin supply hasn‚Äôt transacted onchain in the last 2yrs or more.
üî¥ Supply Last Active 1y+: 65.8%
üü° Supply Last Active 2y+: 54.9%
üü¢ Supply Last Active 3y+: 46.4%
üîµ Supply Last Active 5y+: 31.3%
Live Workbench
The Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator is another tool we can use to profile and visualize the intensity of HODLer distribution pressure. We note a significant and sustained decline in LTH Supply into the $73k ATH in March.
As of the last few weeks however, this distribution pressure has eased off markedly, giving the bulls more breathing room, and less resistance overall.
Live Workbench
The flip side to a decrease in LTH Supply is, a sharp increase in supply held by Short-Term Holders (STHs), who represent new investors who have recently acquired coins.
A local divergence is starting to develop between LTH and STH Supply, which adds weight to the case that there is a cooling off of distribution pressure across mature investors.
Live Workbench
The Liveliness metric also captures this change in market character, and indicates that the Bitcoin network is seeing a greater volume of coinday creation than destruction. In other words, the market is now expressing a greater preference for holding coins for longer periods of time, rather than actively distributing coins for a profit.
Live Chart
Demand Side Remains Modest
The Realized Cap is a metric unique to on-chain analytics, measuring the cumulative USD liquidity ‚Äòstored‚Äô within the asset class. It currently and resides at a value of $574B.
Currently, the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak as the market digests the recently distributed supply.
Live Workbench
The rate at which the Realized Cap changes each day can therefore be used as a gauge for capital inflows. The recent injection of liquidity in the run up to the ATH was extremely sharp, culminating at a value of $3.38B/day. This surpassed the peak of the 2021 bull market, and has cooled off noticeably since.
Currently, this metric remains in positive profit dominated territory, and is returning towards an equilibrium position. However, with declining sell-side headwinds from mature investors, this wave of modest demand has been enough to stimulate price action.
Live Chart
Volatility Compression
With a lightening up of supply-side pressure, but also of capital inflows, it becomes prudent to turn towards our volatility tools to ground our expectations for the next move.
For this, we can employ the Sell-Side Risk metric, which evaluates the total value locked in by coins spent on-chain (Realized Profit + Realized Loss) in relation to the size of the asset class (Realized Cap).
High values
indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.
We can see a large decline in the Sell-Side Risk Ratio over recent weeks, which suggests the market has found a degree of equilibrium over the course of this correction.
Live Workbench
We can also assess market volatility by measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60-days. By this metric, volatility continues to compress to levels typically seen after lengthy consolidations, and prior to large market moves.
Live Workbench
Tracking Top Heaviness
To close out, we can leverage the URPD metric to assess the density of coins with a cost basis around the current spot price. We use this concept to identify points of market sensitivity, where a market move could motivate a response from a large base of investors.
With price moving to the end of the distribution, we note that a substantial ~15.9% of the coin supply is held just below the current spot price, potentially providing a robust cluster of support.
Contrary to the dense cluster of coins below, only 1.1% of the circulating supply remains above our current spot price, suggesting a sustained inflow of demand could catalyze a period of price disovery.
Live Chart
STH supply is currently at 3.36M BTC, and during the recent correction, over 2.14M BTC fell into an unrealized loss (63.2%). However, as the market rallies back above $70k, this has decreased to just 230k BTC, which is approximately 6.8% of the total.
This suggests that despite the heavy concentration of coins near the current spot price, there are relatively few of them not held at an unrealized loss, which considerably reduces the risk of top heaviness developing.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Following an intense period of mature investor distribution into the $73K ATH, sell-side pressure has markedly declined. This has led to a reduction in headwinds and overhead resistance, with even only modest demand able to stimulate positive price action.
Alongside this, volatility continues to compress across longer timeframes, whilst a dense cluster of supply has formed below our current spot price, potentially providing a robust foundation to build upon."

A Coiling Spring
After recording the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows (-20.3%), Bitcoin has recovered back towards the ATH, reaching $71k on 20-May. From a comparative point of view, the drawdowns pattern across the 2023-24 uptrend appears to be remarkably similar to the 2015-17 bull market.
The 2015-17 uptrend occurred during Bitcoin‚Äôs infancy when no derivative instruments were available for the asset class. The parallel we can draw to the current market structure suggests that the 2023-24 uptrend may be a largely spot-driven market. This view is supported by the launch and inflows into the US Spot ETFs.
Live Workbench
Ethereum has also seen notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows compared to prior cycles. This structure infers a degree of increasing market resilience is developing between each successive pullback, alongside a reduction in downside volatility.
However, it is worth highlighting that Ethereum has experienced a slower recovery relative to Bitcoin. ETH has also notably under-performed compared to other leading crypto assets over the last 2 years, manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio.
Nevertheless, the approval of US Spot ETFs this week came as a widely unexpected development and may provide the necessary catalyst to stimulate strength in the ETH/BTC ratio.
Live Workbench
If we examine the rolling performance of the Bitcoin market across weekly üü•, monthly üü¶ and quarterly üüß timeframes, we can see generally strong performance, recording values of +3.3%, +7.4%, and +25.6%, respectively.
To highlight periods of particularly strong price performance, we can count the number of trading days within a 90d window where performance across all three timeframes exceeds +20%. Only 5 days through the last quarter have reached this threshold so far.
In prior cycles, this count reached between 18 and 26-days, which suggests the current market may be somewhat more measured relative to historical bull markets.
Live Workbench
We can assess Ethereum under a similar framework and can see the dramatic impact of the ETF approvals. The news motivated almost instantaneous buy-side pressure, with all three timeframes printing their first >20% price movement since late 2021.
If we consider the sizeable impact and influence that spot ETFs have had on Bitcoin since the turn of the year, the ETH/BTC trading pair may be exhibiting early signs of a more promising road ahead.
Live Workbench
ETF Buyer Comeback
The Bitcoin price decisively broke to a new ATH of $73k in early March, at the same time as long-term holders were divesting a significant volume of supply. This sell-side created an overhang of supply, leading to a period of correction and consolidation. Over time, lower prices and seller exhaustion started to give way to a regime of re-accumulation.
We can see this playing out in the Bitcoin ETF flows which transitioned into a regime of net outflows throughout the month of April. As the market sold off to the local low around $57.5k, the ETFs saw a large net outflow of -$148M/day. However, this turned out to be a form of micro-capitulation, and the trend has reversed sharply since.
Last week, the ETFs experienced a remarkable net inflow of $242M/day, suggesting a return back into buy-side demand. Considering the natural daily sell pressure by miners since the halving of $32M/Day, this ETFs buy pressure is almost 8 times larger. This highlights the size and scale of the ETF impact, but also the relatively small influence of the halving moving forwards.
Live Professional Workbench
Back to Euphoria
The percentage of the circulating supply in profit provides valuable information over each market cycle, and a set of repeating patterns has emerged. During the early stages of a bull market, as price attempts to reclaim the prior ATH, the percent of supply in profit breaks above its statistical threshold of ~90%. This signals the start of the Pre-Euphoria phase, and it historically entices investors to take profit from the table.
This sell-side pressure is usually attributed to long-term holders, who seize the opportunity to exit the market at elevated prices, especially after shouldering the downside volatility throughout the previous bear market.
As the market breaks towards a new ATH and price discovery, it enters the Euphoria phase, where the supply in profit starts to fluctuate around the 90% level for the next 6-12 months. The current euphoria phase is relatively young but has been active for around 2.5 months, with 93.4% of supply held in profit at the time of writing.
Live Advanced Workbench
Another tool we can use to monitor corrections is the magnitude of unrealized losses held by investors. Given unrealised losses near ATHs represent 'local top buyers', we can evaluate the proportion of the supply which falls into loss 90d rolling window. This seeks to assess the percentage of coins which have lost their ‚Äúin-profit‚Äù status compared to the local price peak.
Mechanically, these deep declines occur as new capital enters the network, absorbing sell-side pressure distributed during a local uptrend, which subsequently falls into loss during the following correction.
The depth of these drawdowns throughout the current uptrend is also comparatively similar to the 2015-2017 bull market, again suggesting a relatively robust market. This indicates that despite local peaks being set, they do not appear to have an excessive volume of coins bought at too high of a price.
Live Advanced Workbench
Diamond Hands in Charge
As prices appreciate in response to renewed buy-side pressure, the importance of the opposing side, the sell-side pressure, from Long-Term Holders grows in tandem. Therefore, we can evaluate the unrealized profit of the LTH cohort as a measure of their incentive to sell, and their realized profit to assess actual sell-side.
First, the MVRV Ratio for LTHs reflects their average unrealized profit multiple. Historically, the transition phase between a bear and a bull market sees LTH trade above 1.5, but below 3.5 üüß, and can last for one to two years.
If the market uptrend remains sustainable, forming new ATHs in the process, the unrealized profit held by LTHs will expand. This will substantially elevate their incentive to sell, and eventually leads to a degree of sell-side pressure that gradually exhausts the demand side.
Live Advanced Workbench
To close out this assessment, we will evaluate the spending rate of LTHs by via the 30-day net position change in their supply. During the run-up to the March ATH, the market experienced its first major tranche of LTH distribution.
During the last two bull markets, the LTH net distribution rate reached a substantial 836k to 971k BTC/month. At present, the net sell pressure peaked at 519k BTC/month in late March, with approximately 20% of this originating from Grayscale ETF holders.
This high-spending regime was followed by a cooling-off period, with a local regime of accumulation that saw aggregate LTH supply grow by around +12k BTC/Month.
Live Advanced Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
In the wake of significant long-term holder investor distribution into the $73k ATH, sell-side pressure has noticeably contracted. The Long-Term Holders have since started to re-accumulate coins for the first time since December 2023. Alongside this, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen a clear resurgence in demand, experiencing positive inflows, reflecting a substantial volume of buy-side pressure.
Furthermore, a levelling of the playing field between Bitcoin and Ethereum has occurred, with the approval of US Spot ETFs for Ethereum by the SEC. This further solidifies the ever-growing adoption of digital assets throughout the traditional financial system, and is a major step forward for the industry."

The majority of Bitcoin investors are holding unrealized profits, and the first signs of speculation appetite is returning to the market after two months of sideways trading.
The Short-Term Holder cohort are shouldering the vast majority of market losses, a condition typically observed during bull market corrections from new ATHs.
Both Long and Short-Term Holders have experienced a reset in their Sell-Side Risk ratio, suggesting a new equilibrium has been found. This indicates that the market is ready to move, and volatility expectations for the near future should be heightened.

Mt Gox on the Move
On 28-May-2024, the market reacted to an internal wallet consolidation by the Mt.Gox Trustee, the legal entity who custodies the 141k BTC from the failed exchange. After more than a decade, this is the first indication that the long awaited Mt.Gox distribution event is on the horizon.
Mark Karpeles, the former CEO of Mt.Gox, confirmed that the nature of the coin movement was due to internal wallet management in preparation for distribution back to creditors. Distributions are expected to be completed by October this year.

The standard MtGox Balance metric is mutable, and reflects the best estimate across all points in time. This demonstrates the learning behaviour and clustering of Glassnode metrics as it tracks entity wallets.
Here we can see the internal wallet management, where over 141k BTC were moved over several tranches throughout the day of 28-May.

Capital Flows and Composition
A major impact of such a large pool of long-dormant coins being spent is that unfiltered metrics like Realized Cap, SOPR, and Coindays destroyed will show a large spike associated with these Mt Gox coins. Theoretically, these coins have been revalued to a higher cost-basis during the wallet management transactions.
We can utilize our entity-adjusted variant of the Realized Cap to filter out these non-economical transfers, to maintain a clear picture of capital flows into Bitcoin. The Realized Cap currently resides at an ATH valuation of $580B. However, we can see that the rate of new liquidity inflows has slowed down since late April as the market consolidated.
Live Chart
The Realized Cap HODL Waves metric can then be used to inspect the composition of this aggregate wealth by age. By isolating coins younger than 3-months old, we are able to evaluate the proportion of liquidity held by ‚Äònew demand‚Äô.
This cohort currently accounts for a non-trivial 41% of network wealth, providing evidence that a wealth distribution towards new demand is occurring. With respect to historical terminal values across cycles, this wealth transfer often reaches 70%+ saturation by new demand, suggesting that a comparatively smaller volume of supply has been spent and sold by longer-term investors.
Live Chart
Whilst both inflowing liquidity and appetite for speculation have slowed down over the last 2 months, the reclamation of the $68k level has driven a majority of the Short-Term Holder cohort back into holding an unrealized profit.
This indicates that despite recent sideways choppy price action, the majority of recent buyers now have a cost basis which is more favourable and below the current spot price.
Live Workbench
We can study the average acquisition prices across various age band constituents, and another group of interest are the Single-Cycle holders (coins aged 6m-3y). We note that all components of this group have been holding a significant magnitude of unrealized profit since prices broke above the $40k region.
The market absorbed a large magnitude of distribution from this cohort as price rallied into the $73k ATH. We can expect that this cohorts incentive to sell more supply will grow should prices climb high, and elevate their unrealised profit further.
Live Workbench
A Long-Term Holders Market
With the market consolidating just shy of its ATH, we can employing the URPD metric to visualize the BTC supply by the cost basis at which it was acquired.
There is a significant cluster of Short-Term Holder coins which have been accumulated in close proximity to the current spot price. This suggests significant investment has taken place within this price region. This however introduces a risk of increased investor sensitivity to any volatile price fluctuations in either direction.
Almost all coins held in an unrealized loss are in the Short-Term Holder cohort, which makes sense given the proximity to the prior cycles ATH.
Live in Glassnode Engine Room
The chart below is a tool describing the proportion of the Short-Term Holder supply which is held in loss. This tool can be used to observe when this cohort experiences heightened sensitivity to changes in price action, particularly when a large volume of supply falls into loss over a short time period.
The market recently pulled back to $58k, reflecting a -21% correction, and the largest contraction since the collapse of FTX. At the lows of this move, a staggering 56% (1.9M BTC) of the STH supply moved into a position of loss.
However, whilst a large volume of supply was technically underwater, the magnitude of unrealised loss remained in line with typical bull market corrections, and is beginning to abate as the market stabilizes.
Live Workbench
Turning to Long-Term Holders, we can see that the total volume of LTH Supply held in loss is negligible, with only 4.9k BTC (0.03% of LTH Supply) acquired above the spot price. Given new ATHs were only set in March (less than 155-days ago), these LTH coins in loss are the small few holders who bought the 2021 cycle top, and have held ever since.
Live Workbench
Another way to visualise this is via the proportion of all supply held in loss, which falls into the LTH cohort. At the bottom of bear markets, LTHs tend to carry the majority of unrealized losses, as speculators are flushed from the market, and the final capitulation results in a major transfer of coin ownership towards high conviction holders.
Conversely, during the euphoric phase of the Bull Market, the LTH contribution to the supply held in loss tends towards zero. In parallel, the STHs shoulder the vast majority of market losses, as new demand buys coins near the local and global price peaks.
At the moment, the LTHs hold a marginal 0.3% of the supply in loss, whilst subsequently accounting for over 85% of the supply in profit.
Live Workbench
Room for Growth
We can investigate the activity of our Long and Short-Term holder cohorts via analysis of their spending behaviors. For this, we can utilize the Sell-Side Risk Ratio which assesses the absolute value of profit plus loss locked in by investors, in relation to the size of the asset (measured as the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.
Notably, a reset in both profit and loss taking has occurred across the STH cohort, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been established during the recent sideways price consolidation.
Live Workbench
For the Long-Term Holder cohort, their Sell-Side Risk ratio increased significantly as profits were taken leading up to and through the $73k ATH.
However, in a historical context, their Sell-Side Risk ratio remains at a lower level compared to prior ATH breaks. This implies that the relative magnitude of profit taken by the LTH cohort is small relative to previous market cycles. This may suggest that this cohort is waiting for higher prices before ramping up their distribution pressure.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
The first glimmers of market speculation appear to be returning after a a multi-month price consolidation. Both new buyers, and single-cycle investors are primarily holding unrealized profits. This observation is bolstered by the fact that only 0.03% of the Long-Term Holders are in a position of loss, which is typical of the early euphoric phase of a bull market.
Over the last 2-months, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for both Long and Short-Term Holders has reset and returned to an equilibrium. This suggests that a majority of profit and loss which was likely to be taken in this price range, has been, and hints to an increased risk of substantial volatility in the near future."

A Divergence in Activity
Onchain activity metrics like active addresses, transactions, and volumes provide a valuable toolkit to analyse the growth and performance of blockchain networks. When China imposed restrictions on Bitcoin mining in mid-2021, the number of Active Addresses on the Bitcoin network experienced an aggressive decline, plunging from over ~1.1M/day to just ~800k/day.
The Bitcoin network is currently experiencing similar contraction in network activity, albeit, with entirely different drivers. In the following sections, we shall explore how the advent of Inscriptions, Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Runes have significantly altered how on-chain analysts should perceive activity metrics moving forwards.
Live Workbench
Despite the historical confluence between strong market momentum, and an expansion of active addresses and transaction counts per day, a deviation in this trend is underway.
Whilst active addressees appear to be collapsing, the amount of transactions processed by the network has seen is near new all-time-highs. The present monthly average transaction count resides at 617k/day, which is 31% above the yearly average, and signifies a relatively high demand for Bitcoin blockspace.
Live Workbench
If we compare the recent decline of active addresses with the share of transactions attributed to inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, we can observe a strong correlation. Of note, Inscription counts have also fallen off a cliff since mid April.
This suggests that the initial driver of the decline in address activity is largely due to reduction in inscription and ordinals usage. It is important to note that many wallets and protocols within this sector reuse addresses, which are not double counted if the address is active more than once in a daily period. As such, if a single address generates ten transactions in a day, it would appear as one active address, but ten transactions.
Live Chart
To illustrate how the inscriptions sector has grown since early 2023, we can see how the cumulative total inscription count has expanded. The number of inscriptions has reached 71M at the time of writing, however, since mid-April this year, the popularity of the protocol has declined markedly.
Live Chart
To explain the decline in inscription activity, we must highlight the emergence of the Runes protocol, which claims to be a more efficient method to introduce fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Runes went live on the halving block, which explains the inscription drop off in in mid-April.
Runes follow a different mechanism to Inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, by utilziing the OP_RETURN field (80 bytes). This allows the protocol to encode arbitrary data to the chain whilst requiring significantly less blockspace.
With the Runes Protocol launching at the time of halving (20 April 2024), the demand for runes transactions skyrocketed to between 600k and 800k per day, and has remained elevated since.
Image Metric
Runes-related transactions have now largely displaced BRC-20 tokens, as well as Ordinals and Inscriptions, commanding an impressive 57.2% of daily transactions. This indicates that collector speculation has likely shifted from Inscriptions to the Runes market.
Image Metric
A Divergence in ETF Demand
Another recent divergence which has garnered attention is the stagnant, sideways movement of price despite the impressive inflows into the US Spot ETFs. To ground and assess the ETF demand-side, we can compare the ETF balance (862k BTC) to other major labelled entities.
US Spot ETF = 862k BTC
Mt. Gox Trustee = 141k BTC
US Government = 207k BTC
All Exchanges = 2.3M BTC
Miners (Exc. Patoshi) = 706k BTC
The aggregated balance of all these entities is estimated to be ~4.23M, which accounts for 27% of the overall adjusted circulating supply (which is the total supply minus coins that have remained dormant for more than seven years).
Live Workbench
Coinbase as an entity holds a vast fraction of both aggregate exchange balances, as well the US Spot ETF balances via its custody service. The Coinbase Exchange and Coinbase Custody entities currently hold an estimated 270k and 569k BTC respectively.
Image Metric
With Coinbase serving both ETF clients and conventional on-chain asset holders, the gravity of the exchange in the market pricing process has become significant. Evaluating the number of Whale Deposits to Coinbase exchange wallets, we can see a considerable increase in deposit transactions following the launch of the ETFs.
However, we note a significant portion of the deposits are associated with the outflows from the GBTC address cluster, which has been a long-standing supply overhead throughout the year.
Live Workbench
In addition to GBTC selling pressure as the market rallied to new ATHs, another factor has recently contributed to the dampening of US Spot ETF demand pressure.
Looking at the CME Group futures market, open Interest has stabilized above $8B, after setting a new record high of $11.5B in March 2024. This may signal that an increasing number of traders from traditional markets are adopting a cash-and-carry-arbitrage strategy.
This arbitrage involves a market-neutral position, coupling the purchase of a long spot position, and the sale (short) of a position in a futures contract of the same underlying asset which is trading at a premium.
Live Chart
We can see that entities categorised as hedge funds are building up an increasingly large net short position for Bitcoin.
This provides confluence that the cash-and-carry trade structure may be a meaningful source of ETF inflow demand, where the ETFs are the instrument for obtaining the long spot exposure. The CME Group exchange has also seen a dramatic increase in both open interest, and overall market dominance since 2023, suggesting it is becoming a preferred venue for hedge funds to shorting futures via the CME Group exchange.
At present, Hedge Funds are net short in both CME Bitcoin and Micro CME Bitcoin markets by $6.33B and $97M, respectively.
CME COTs - THE BLOCK
Summary and Conclusions
The drastic divergence between activity metrics has been accelerated by the extreme popularity of the Runes protocol, which utilizes significant address reuse where singular addresses are generating multiple transactions.
The emergence and magnitude of the Cash-and-Carry trade between long US Spot ETF products and shorting futures via the CME Group exchange has largely neutered the buy-side inflows into ETFs. This has resulted in a relatively neutral impact on market prices, suggesting organic buy-side from non-arbitrage demand is required to further stimulate positive price action."

Despite chaotic price action, investor profitability remains robust, with the average coin holding an unrealized profit of around 120%.
The demand side has been sufficient to absorb sell-side pressure and HODLer divestment but insufficient to promote further upward growth.
The cash-and-carry trade continues, with a particular uptick by institutional traders, reinforcing an expectation of range-bound trading for the time being.

Market Profitability Remains Robust
Sideways price movement tends to manifest as investor boredom and apathy, which appears to be the dominant response across all Bitcoin markets. BTC prices are consolidating within a well-established trade range. Investors remain in a generally favourable position, with over 87% of the circulating supply held in profit, with a cost basis below the spot price.
Live Chart
Employing the MVRV metric, we can assess the magnitude of unrealized profit the average investor is holding.
Currently, the average coin holds an unrealized profit of around +120%, typical of previous markets trading around the previous cycle ATH. The MVRV Ratio remains above its yearly baseline, suggesting that the macro uptrend remains intact.
Live Workbench
We can use the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands which assess points of extreme deviations in investor profitability relative to the long-term mean. Historically, breakouts above 1 standard deviation have aligned with longer-term macro topping formations.
Currently, the BTC price is stabilizing and consolidating between the 0.5 and 1 standard deviation range. This again highlights the statistically high profit the average investor is holding despite the recent choppy market conditions.
Live Workbench
When the market decisively punched above the 2021 ATH, significant investor distribution occurred, driven largely by the Long-Term Holder cohort. This reflected a substantial profit being made, which acts to increase the actively traded and liquid supply.
Typically, in the immediate aftermath of a new ATH, the market needs ample time to consolidate and digest the introduced supply overhang. As an equilibrium is established, this leads to a decline in both realized profits and sell-side pressure.
This reduction in sell-side pressure and profit-taking naturally reduces overhead market resistance. Nevertheless, the BTC price has been unable to sustain a palpable upward rally since the March ATH. This demonstrates that while the demand side is stable enough to keep the market range bound, it is ultimately not increasing sufficiently to reestablish upward momentum.
Live Workbench
Lackluster Volume
Despite healthy investor profitability, the magnitude of volume being processed and transferred on the Bitcoin Network following the ATH has declined drastically. This underscores a reduced appetite for speculation and heightened indecision in the market.
Live Chart
A similar story can be observed when assessing the Spot Volume traded across major centralized exchanges. This demonstrates the strong correlation between onchain network settlement volumes and trade volumes, echoing a sentiment of boredom amongst investors.
Live Chart
Exchange Activity Tumbles
Moving one level deeper, we can inspect the onchain inflows to exchanges in a BTC denomination, we note once more a considerable reduction in activity.
At present, Short-Term Holders are sending around +17.4k BTC/day to exchanges. However, this is markedly lower than the peak of +55k BTC/day recorded as the market hit the $73k ATH in March, where speculation levels were becoming excessive. Conversely, Long-Term Holder distribution into exchanges is relatively low, with only a marginal 1k+ BTC/day in inflows currently.
Live Workbench
We can visualize the stark decline in LTH investor activity via the percentage of Long-term Holder balances sent to exchanges.
LTHs are sending less than 0.006% of their total holdings into exchanges, suggesting that this cohort has reached equilibrium and that higher or lower prices are required to stimulate further action.
Live Workbench
More coins are currently being transferred in a position of profit (+11k BTC) than in loss (+8.2k BTC). This suggests that a profit driven bias remains overall, albeit by a relatively small margin.
Live Workbench
Currently, the average coin sent to Exchanges is realizing a profit of around +$5.5k and a -$735 haircut, respectively, for coins sent in the loss. This puts the average profit at 7.5x larger than losses, and only 14.5% of trading days have recorded a higher value in this ratio.
This infers that HODLers are still divesting, and demand is sufficient to absorb the sell-side pressure but not large enough to push market prices higher. This suggests that the market structure is more beneficial for range traders and arbitrage strategies rather than directional and trend trading strategies.
Live Workbench
Cash and Carry Basis Trades
Another tool that enables us to characterize spot markets is the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD). This metric describes the net bias in market taker buy vs sell volume, measured in USD.
At the moment, a net sell-side bias dominates the spot market, however, the market continues to trend sideways. This confluences the aforementioned idea that the demand-side is approximately equivalent to the sell-side pressure, keeping the market range bound.
Live Chart
Assessing the futures market, we note a sustained elevation in open interest, currently over $30B, and just shy of its previous ATH. However, as highlighted in
WoC-24
, a substantial portion of this open interest is related to the market-neutral cash-and-carry basis trade.
In a range-bound market, increases in open interest can signify an uptick of volatility capture strategies as traders collect the premium available in the perpetual swap, futures, and options markets.
Live Chart
The considerable growth of open interest at the CME Group exchange highlights a growing presence of institutional investors. The CME Group exchange currently hosts over $10B in OI, representing just under a third of the global market share.
Live Chart
In contrast to the rising open interest, futures trade volumes have experienced a similar decline to spot markets and onchain transfer volumes. This suggests a relatively light appetite for speculation, and a higher dominance from set-and-forget basis trade and arbitrage positions.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Despite the choppy and sideways market conditions the average Bitcoin investor has remained largely profitable. However, investor decisiveness has declined as signified by contracting volumes across spot, and derivatives market, and also in on-chain settlement.
An equilibrium in both the demand and sell-side appears to be established, resulting in relatively stable prices, and a notable lack in volatility. This stagnation in market movement translates into a degree of boredom, apathy, and indecision by investors. Historically, this suggests that a decisive price movement in either direction is necessary to stimulate the next round of market activity."

The market has effectively traded sideways since the $73k all-time-high which was set in March. By our estimates, demand momentum has turned negative since early May.
We analyse the cost-basis of short-term investors as a method to inspect capital flows into the market.
To analyze the supply side, we refer to long-term holders, and identify that the unrealized profit held by this cohort is statistically far from historical peaks.
Looking at the spending behaviour of long-term holders, it can be seen that although the spent volume by these players constitutes only 4%-8% of the total volume, the profits realized from this spending typically account for 30%-40% of cumulative profits realized over bull markets. This finding underlines the concentration of wealth in older coins gradually paying back the diamond hands over the bull market.

Tracking Demand
In
WoC 18
, we explored a methodology to identify the direction and intensity of capital flows in or out of the market. We consider a framework utilizing the average cost-basis of various age brackets within the short-term holder cohort:
When the cost basis of these cohorts is in an uptrend, it suggests capital flows into the market as new buyers acquire coins at higher prices (and vice versa for downtrends).
As spot prices deviate above or below the cost basis, we can approximate the degree of unrealized profit held by each group via the MVRV Ratio.
We can consider MVRV values to be a gauge on the incentive for investors to take profits (high values), or an indicator of seller exhaustion (low values).
We will start by comparing the spot price in relation to the cost basis of two cohorts:
üü† Holders with 1-week to 1-month old coins.
üî¥ Holders with 1 to 3-month old coins.
From this, we can identify when macro tides change in capital flows during the early stages of the bull and bear phases. The chart below presents how these two price models have provided market support during the 2023-24 bull.
Since mid-June, the spot price has plunged below the cost basis of both the 1w-1m holders üü†($68.5k) and 1m-3m holders üî¥ ($66.4k). If this structure persists, it has historically resulted in a deterioration of investor confidence, and risks this correction being deeper and taking longer to recover from.
Live Workbench
We can also characterise market momentum by comparing the cost basis of these cohorts to each other. The chart below highlights:
Capital Inflows üü¶
when the cost basis of the 1w-1m holders trades above the 1m-3m cost basis. This underscores a positive momentum in demand, and, attracting new capital into the market
Capital Outflows
üü™ when the cost basis of the 1w-1m holders plunges below the 1m-3m cost basis. This structure signals a diminishing momentum in the demand side, and a net capital outflow from the asset.
During previous bull markets, a negative capital flow structure has occurred up to five times. We can also see that this structure has been in play since May and into early June.
Live Workbench
Navigating the Supply Side
To achieve a complete macro view of the current market, we can leverage metrics which describe the behavior of Long-term holders (LTHs). The LTH cohort is the primary actor on the supply side during bull markets as they distribute coins and take profits. Market cycle tops are established, in part, when LTHs ramp up their selling intensity until it overwhelms and exhausts demand.
The following chart compares the spot price against significant multiples applied to the average cost basis of the LTH cohort (LTH Realized Price).
1.0 * LTH Realized Price üü¢
historically aligns with the bottom formation phase of the bear cycle and into the market recovery.
1.5 * LTH Realized Price üü†
delineates the recovery phase from a longer-term equilibrium phase of the bull. Price tends to experience a slower rate of growth, and on average, LTHs are holding an unrealized profit is around +50%.
3.5 * LTH Realized Price üî¥
provides a distinguishing boundary between the equilibrium phase, and the euphoria phases of the bull market. This is a point where price tends to appreciate quickly, and LTHs tend to increase their distribution pressure due to being at an unrealized profit of 250% or more.
If we apply this framework to recent cycles, we can see that the ongoing bull has been very similar to the 2017 cycle from a macro perspective. In particular, the recent consolidation phase near the previous ATH aligns with the equilibrium to euphoria boundary described by the 3.5 multiple applied to the LTH-Realized Price üî¥.
Live Workbench
The magnitude of unrealized profit held by LTHs can be considered as a measurement of the incentive for this group to spend coins, and take chips off the table. We can visualise this psychological incentive using the LTH-NUPL metric.
At the time of writing, LTH-NUPL is at 0.66, which resides between levels associated with the pre-euphoria phase üü¢. This condition has been in play for 96-days, which is a very similar duration to the 2016-17 cycle.
Live Chart
Using the Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator, we can identify periods where strong spending by this cohort is underway. During these events, the aggregate balance held by LTHs declines consistently, and significantly.
From this, we can identify the following LTH-spending regimes:
Weak Spending üü©
where LTH supply declines for at least 3 of the last 15-days.
Moderate Spending üüß
where LTH supply declines for at least 8 of the last 15-days.
Strong Spending üü•
where LTH supply declines for more than 12 of the last 15-days.
Live Workbench
The next chart has been designed to combine both of the previous models to assess LTH sentiment and behavior. This combines the incentive for this cohort to take profits with their actual spending behaviour.
We consider four regimes describing shifts in LTH divestment and behavior patterns:
Capitulation
üü• where spot price is lower than the LTH cost basis, and therefore any strong spending¬†is likely associated with fear and capitulation.
Transition
üüß where price trades slightly above the LTH cost basis, and with occasional light spending. This is considered to be associated with typical day-to-day activity.
Equilibrium
üü® after recovering from a prolonged bear, where the market seeks a new balance between a light inflow of new demand, lighter liquidity, and a gradual divestment by underwater holders from the previous cycle. Strong LTH spending during this stage is usually associated with sudden rallies or corrections.
Euphoria
üü© as LTH-MVRV trades above 3.5, and is historically aligned with the market hitting the prior cycle ATH. The LTH cohort holds upwards of +250% in unrealized profits on average. The market enters a euphoric rise, which motivates these investors to spend at very high and accelerating rates.
Using this stencil, we can see an elevated spending regime by LTHs throughout Q4 2023 and into 2024 Q1. This puts the market into the equilibrium regime over this period.
Live Workbench
Dissecting the Spending By Strong Hands
The previous metric considers periods when the aggregate Long-Term Holder supply declines. Similarly, the Short-Term Holder cohort, we can also inspect which sub-age-groups are responsible for the sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
To assess the contribution of each sub-group of LTH spending, we have highlighted the days when their spending volume is at least one standard deviation above the yearly average.
Whilst there are occasional bursts of spending activity for each cohort, the frequency of high-spending days increases dramatically during the euphoria phase of a bull market. This highlights the relatively consistent behaviour pattern of long-term investors taking profits during periods of rapid price appreciation.
Live Workbench
Given only 4%-8% of daily on-chain volume corresponds to LTHs, we can leverage another core on-chain metric to explain the relative weight of these investors on the supply side.
Live Chart
Despite their small share of spent volume, LTH coins are typically moving at significantly higher (or lower) prices than when they were initially acquired. Therefore, the magnitude of the realized profit or loss via spent coins provides a valuable lens into their behavior patterns.
The chart below captures the cumulative volume of realized profit locked in by long-term holders during bull markets. What we find is that LTHs typically account for between 20% and 40% of the total profit locked in over time.
Despite their volume being just 4% to 8% of the daily total, the LTH cohort accounts for up to 40% of the profit taking by investors.
Live Workbench
Conclusion
With sideways price action dominating since early March, we leveraged the cost-basis of both long and short-term investors to assess the current degree of supply and demand in the market.
Utilizing the change in Short-Term investors' sub-cohorts‚Äô cost basis, we constructed a toolbox that estimates the momentum of capital flow into the network. The results confirmed that the ATH in March was followed by an interval of capital outflow (negative momentum).
Following on, we dissected the Long-Term Holder spending into different age sub-cohorts. The conclusion indicated that the frequency of high-spending days increases dramatically during the euphoria phase of a bull market. Interestingly, the Long-Term Holders volume accounts for a only marginal 4% to 8% of the daily total, however, the cohort represents a substantial 40% of the profit taken by investors."

Market Profitability Remains Robust
As BTC prices sold off down into the $60k region, a degree of fear and bearish sentiment could be discerned amongst many digital asset investors. This is not uncommon when market volatility stagnates and goes to sleep, as apathy creeps in.
Nevertheless, from the lens of MVRV Ratio, aggregate investor profitability remains remarkably robust, with the average coin still holding a 2x profit multiple. This is a level that often delineates the '
Enthusiastic
' and the '
Euphoric
' bull market phases.
Live Chart
Moving one layer deeper, we can segregate all coins held either in a position of unrealized profit or loss. This allows us to evaluate the average cost basis of each group, as well as the average magnitude of unrealized profit and loss held per coin.
üî¥
The average coin in profit is holding an unrealized gain of +$41.3k,
with a cost basis of approximately $19.4k. Of note, this figure will be partially skewed by coins last moved in earlier cycles, including the Patoshi entity, early miners, and lost coins.
üîµ
The average coin in loss is holding an unrealized loss of -$5.3k
, and has a cost basis of approximately
$66.1k
. These coins are primarily held by Short-Term Holders, since very few 'top buyers' from the 2021 cycle still hold on today.
Both of these metrics can help identify points of potential sell-pressure, as investors seek to hold onto their gains, and/or avoid holding onto even heavier unrealized losses.
Live Workbench
If we look at the ratio between the unrealized profit/loss per coin, we can see that the magnitude of paper gains held is 8.2x larger than paper losses. Only 18% of trading days have recorded a larger relative value, all of which are within Euphoric bull market regimes.
It could be argued that the March ATH set following the approval of the ETFs had several characteristics which are coincident with historical bull market peaks.
Live Workbench
Grounding Expectations Using Confluence
Bitcoin prices have been consolidating within a well defined $60k to $70k range since the March ATH, and a degree of investor apathy and boredom has taken hold. This has led to widespread indecision, and a market which has failed to establish a robust trend in either direction.
To ground our position in the cycle, we shall consult a simplified framework for thinking about historical Bitcoin market cycles:
üî¥
Deep Bear Market:
Prices trades below the Realized Price.
üîµ
Early Bull Market:
Prices trade between Realized Price and True Market Mean.
üü†

Euphoric Bull Market:
Prices trade above the previous cycles ATH.
At the moment, prices remains within the
Enthusiastic
bull regime, after a few very brief excursions into the Euphoric zone. The True Market Mean resides at a value of $50k, which represents the average cost basis per active investor.
This level remains a key pricing levels for the market to remain above if the macro bull market is expected to continue.
Live Workbench
Next we will look towards the Short-Term Holder cohort, and overlay their cost basis with levels denoting +-1 standard deviations from it. This provides insight into areas where these price sensitive holders may start to react:
üî¥¬†Significant unrealized profit signals a potentially overheated market, which is currently at a value of $92k.
üü†¬†The break-even level of the STH cohort is at $64k, which the spot price is currently below, but making an attempt to reclaim.
üîµ¬†Significant unrealized loss signals a potentially oversold market, which is currently at at a value of $50k. This aligns with True Market Mean as a bull market break-point.
Of note, only 7% of trading days have recorded spot prices trading below the -1SD band, making it a relatively uncommon occurrence.
Live Workbench
With price trading below the STH cost basis, it is judicious to inspect the degree of financial stress within various subsets of this cohort. Using our breakdown by age metrics, we can dissect and inspect the cost-basis of differing age constituents within the Short-Term Holder cohort.
Currently, coins aged 1d-1w, 1w-1m and 1m-3m are all holding an unrealized loss on average. This shows that this consolidation range has been largely unproductive for traders and investors.
The 3m-6m cohort remains the only sub-group to remain in an unrealized profit, with an average cost-basis of $58k. This aligns with the price low of this correction, which again marks this as a key area of interest.
Live Workbench
Moving towards technical indicators. we can use the widely used Mayer Multiple metric, which assesses the ratio between price and its 200DMA. The 200DMA is often used as a simple indicator for assessing bullish or bearish momentum, making any breaks above or below a key market pivot point.
The 200DMA currently resides at a value of $58k, once again providing confluence with on‚Äìchain price models.
Live Workbench
We can use the URPD metric to further assess concentrations of supply around particular cost basis clusters. Currently, the spot price is near the lower bound of a large supply node between $60k and the ATH. This aligns with the cost basis models of Short-Term Holders.
With 2.63M BTC (13.4% of the circulating supply) located within the $60k to $70k cluster, small price fluctuations are able to substantially affect the profitability of coins and investor portfolios.
Overall, this indicates a risk that many investors may be sensitive to any price drops below $60k.
Live Chart
Volatility Expectations
After several months of range-bound price action, we note a marked decline in volatility across many rolling window time frames. To visualise this phenomena, we introduce a simple tool to detect periods of realized volatility contraction, which often provides an indicator that heightened volatility is likely ahead.
The model assesses the 30d change in Realized Volatility across 1-week, 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year timeframes. When all windows are exhibiting negative 30d change, a signal is triggered, inferring that volatility is compressing, and so are investor expectations of lower volatility ahead.
Live Workbench
We can also assess market volatility by measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60-days. By this metric, volatility continues to compress to levels rarely seen, but usually after lengthy consolidations, and prior to large market moves.
Live Workbench
Finally, we can bolster our volatility assessment using the Sell-Side Risk Ratio. This tool assesses the absolute sum of realised profit and loss locked in by investors, relative to the size of the asset (the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.
Notably, the STH Sell-Side Risk has contracted to historic lows, with only 274 out of 5083 trading days (5%) recording a lower value. This suggests that a degree of equilibrium has been established during this price consolidation, and alludes to heightened volatility expectations in the near future.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
The Bitcoin market is in an interesting place, with apathy and boredom dominating, despite prices being 20% below the ATH. The average coin is still holding a 2x unrealized profit. however newer buyers are disproportionately underwater on their positions.
We also explored key pricing levels where investor behavior patterns may shift. We sought a degree of confluence across both on-chain and technical indicators, and derived three key areas of interest.
A break below $58k to $60k would put a significant number of STHs into loss, and trade below the 200DMA price level.
Price action between $60k and $64k continues the current sideways trajectory of market indecision.
A decisive break above $64k would put a meaningful volume of STH coins back into profit, with a likely uptick in investor sentiment.
Volatility continues to compress across multiple time-frames, both from a pricing, and an on-chain perspective. Metrics like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, and 60-day price range have fallen towards historic lows. This suggests that the current trading range is in the later stages of developing towards the next range expansion."

Bitcoin has recorded its deepest drawdown for the current cycle, trading more than -26% below the ATH. Despite this, the drawdown remains historically shallow relative to past cycles.
This price contraction has put a significant volume of Short-Term Holder Supply into an unrealized loss, with over 2.8M BTC now underwater based on their on-chain acquisition price.
Whilst financial pressure is elevated amongst Short-Term Holders, the magnitude of losses locked in has remained relatively subdued in comparison to the market size.

Price Performance
The 2023-24 Bitcoin cycle has been both similar and different to previous cycles. The market experienced around 18 months of steady price appreciation after the collapse of FTX, followed by three months of range-bound price action after the $73k ETF high. Between May and July, the market experienced its deepest cycle correction, recording a drawdown exceeding -26% from the ATH.
Whilst this is meaningful, this downtrend has been notably shallower than previous cycles, highlighting a relatively robust underlying market structure and compression of volatility as Bitcoin matures as an asset class.
Live Workbench
If we assess price performance relative to each cycle low, the 2023-24 market has behaved eerily similar to the last two cycles (2018-21 and 2015-17). The reason for Bitcoin following such a similar path is a regular topic of debate, but it continues to provide a valuable framework for analysts to think about cycle structure and duration.
Live Workbench
However, if we look at performance indexed to the date of the Bitcoin halving, we can see that the current cycle is one of the worst performing. This is despite the market breaching to a new cyclical ATH prior to the halving event in April, which was the first time this has happened.
üî¥¬†Epoch 2: +117%
üîµ¬†Epoch 3: -7%

On a daily basis, we can evaluate the number of daily drawdowns during an uptrend which exceed the 1 Standard Deviation threshold to the downside. This helps us assess the number of meaningful sell-off events that investors experienced throughout the bull market uptrend.

19 Events
2015-18:
27 Events
2018-21:
26 Events
Current Cycle 2023-24:
6 Events (to date)
The current cycle has recorded 6 daily drawdowns more than 1 standard deviation below the long term mean. This would suggest that the current cycle has either been notably shorter and less volatile than previous cycles, or perhaps there is more fuel in the investor tank.

New Investors Underwater
Assessing the volume of supply held by Short-Term Holders, we can see substantial growth from January 2024 onward. This accompanied explosive upwards price action in response to the spot ETFs going live, and reflected a strong inflow of new demand.
However, this demand profile has reached a plateau in growth over recent months, suggesting an equilibrium had formed between supply and demand in Q2-2024. This has since given way to a supply overhang, as fewer Long-Term Holders take profits, and fewer new buyers step in to accumulate.
Live Chart
During sustained bull markets, local bottoms are commonly established after the volume of Short-Term Holder supply held in loss saturates around 1M to 2M BTC. In more severe cases, this supply in loss can peak to between 2M and 3M BTC.
We can see an example of this during the recent sell-off down to the 53k price level, which pushed the volume of coins held below their cost basis to over 2.8M BTC. This is the second time this has occurred in the last 12-months, with August 2023 being the other example where over 2M BTC owned by new investors were held in an unrealized loss.
Live Workbench
We can assess he intensity of these periods by counting the number days where more than 2M Short-Term Holder coins were underwater for at least a 90 day period. By this metric, this indicator has actively flagged for 20 days so far.
If we make a comparison with the market conditions seen in Q2-Q3 2021, a much more significant Short-Term Holders experienced a much more significant duration of 70 consecutive days in acute financial stress. That period of time was severe enough to break investor sentiment, and gave way to the destructive 2022 bear market. By comparison, this cycle has been relatively forging for the time being.
Live Workbench
A Halt On Profitability
With a contraction in spot prices underway, the ratio between investor Realized Profit and Realized Loss has declined in tandem. This indicator has now declined into the 0.50 to 0.75 range, which is a more neutral level seen during bull markets corrections.
We can also see a similar pattern of sharp fluctuations in this metric throughout the 2019 to 2022 cycle, which could be considered a reflection of inherent instability and investor uncertainty.
Live Workbench
Zooming into Short-Term Holder losses specifically, we can see a total realized loss of ~ $595m was locked in by this cohort this week. This is the largest loss taking event since the 2022 cycle low.
Furthermore, only 52 out of 5655 trading days (< 1%) have recorded a larger daily loss value, highlighting the severity of this correction in dollar terms.
Live Workbench
However, when we denominate these same Short-Term Holder losses as a percentage of total invested wealth (divided by the STH Realized Cap), we can see a dramatically different picture. On a relative basis, the losses locked in by this cohort remain fairly typical compared to previous bull market corrections.
In the chart below, we have highlighted (blue) periods of time where the both percent of Short-Term Supply held in Loss, and the magnitude of losses locked have moved more than 1 standard deviation from the mean.
Live Workbench
Looking at losses locked in by both Long-Term, and Short-Term Holders, we note that the loss taking events this week account for less than 36% of the total capital flows across the Bitcoin network.
Major capitulation events, such as Sep 2019, March 2020, and the sell-off in May 2021, saw losses account for more than 60% of capital flows over a period of several weeks, with a meaningful contribution from both cohorts.
Therefore, it could be argued that there are more similarities between the prevailing market contraction, and the Q1-2021 topping formation, more so than severe capitulation events. Nevertheless, the onus still falls towards the demand side to arrest the negative price momentum, else the profitability of investors will continue to deteriorate.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
Following 18 months of up-only price action after the FTX implosion, and 3 months of apathetic sideways trading, the market has endured its deepest correction of the cycle. Nevertheless, drawdowns across our current cycle remains favourable when compared to historical cycles suggesting a relatively robust underlying market structure.
The aggressive contraction has plunged a significant amount of Short-Term Holders into a position of severe unrealized loss, placing a large degree of pressure upon the cohort. However, the magnitude of losses locked in has remained relatively subdued in comparison to the market size. Alongside this, the lack of Long-Term Holder participation in loss taking suggests mature investors remain profitable, despite the ensuing market hysteria."

Large labelled entities currently hold approximately 4.9M BTC, which is equivalent to 25% of the circulating supply. Amongst these entities, centralized exchanges and ETF custodians account for the largest portion.
Following the complete exhaustion of BTC sell-side by the German Government, there appears to be near-term sell-side relief, as well as renewed inflows of demand to support the market.
Market profitability remains remarkably robust, with the majority of the coin supply still held at a favourable cost basis, and below the current spot price.

Assessing Large Entities
The landscape of Bitcoin holders remains a constantly evolving space, which requires an evolution of analysis frameworks over time. Historically, miners and exchanges have been the largest and most dominant Bitcoin holders.
Through history, large coin holdings have ended up custodied by market agnostic entities, such as the Mt.Gox trustee, tasked with holding the coins recovered after the collapse and bankruptcy of the Mt.Gox exchange. Similarly, significant coin volumes have been seized by government law enforcement, which are periodically sold off in tranches.
More recently, institutional grade custodians, and ETFs have entered the picture. The suite of 11 new US spot ETFs have now accrued a combined +887K BTC, making their combined balance the second largest pool of Bitcoin that we monitor.
The chart below shows the volume of BTC held by these large entities.
üü® Centralized Exchanges: 3M BTC
‚¨ú¬†US ETF Balance: 887k BTC
üü¶ Miners excluding Patoshi: 705k BTC
üü© Government Entities: 207k BTC
üü• Mt Gox Trustee: 139k BTC
Live Workbench
Miners have historically been a primary source of sell-side pressure, however their supply relevance does decrease with each halving event. Miner netflows over the last 12-months shows a typical aggregate balance change of around ¬±500 BTC per week.
In the chart below, we compare miner net flows üîµ to the net deposit / withdrawal volumes of centralized exchanges üü†, and to the netflows into ETF on-chain wallets üü¢. We can see that the latter two entities often see much larger swings of ¬±4K BTC, suggesting flows through these entities are likely to have a market influence of around 4x to 8x larger than for miners.
Live Workbench
Keeping this netflow dynamic as our baseline, we can gauge the intensity of estimated sell-side pressure by large sized entities, by isolating only net outflow volumes. From this, three key observations can be made:
Elevated sell-side pressure from miners tends to occur around periods of price volatility.
ETF outflows dominated following the market setting a new ATH in March, which was largely dominated by the GBTC product.
Sell-side sourced from the German Government in the last few weeks has been tremendous. However, we can also see that the majority of outflows occurred after prices had sold off to $54k, suggesting the market effectively front-ran the news.
Live Workbench
The chart below shows the cumulative net outflow activity of these large entities since the $73k ATH. From this, we can see how sell-side pressure from Miners is comparatively small relative to Government sell-side, ETF outflows, and exchange deposit volumes.
Centralized exchange deposits continue to be the largest and most persistent source of sell-side pressure. However even with these primary trading venues as our upper bound, we can see the massive scale of sell-side from the German Government of late.
Live Workbench
Increasing our focus on the German Government sell pressure, we can see their 48.8k BTC balance was depleted over just a few weeks. The majority was distributed over a very short window between 7-July and the 10th-July, where over 39.8k BTC flowed out of labelled wallets.
Interestingly, this sell-side occurred after the market had bottomed around $54k, suggesting market front-ran the news.
Live Chart
Stability and Speculation
Following an extended period of choppy range-bound trading, aggregated netflows across all ETFs saw a sustained period of outflows. As prices sold off towards the $54k low, they dropped below the average inflow cost basis of ETF holders, which is currently at $58.2k.
In response, the ETFs have seen their first significant tranche of positive interest since early June, with over $1B in total inflows last week alone.
Live Chart
Volumes deposited and withdrawn from exchanges tend to be a strong gauge for investor interest and market liquidity. After the ATH was set in March, there has been a marked decline in exchange flows, where BTC volumes üü† have since found a stable baseline of around $1.5B/day.
If we compare the inflow and outflow structure for Ethereum üîµ, there has been a notably less interest relative to the 2021 bull cycle. At the height of the 2021 bull cycle, daily ETH exchange flows were almost as large as for BTC.
This suggests that the degree of speculative interest in 2024 has been comparatively muted, and aligns with the generally weaker performance of ETH relative to BTC since the 2022 cycle lows.
Live Workbench
The magnitude of realized profit and loss being locked in by investors can also provide a proxy for demand. By this metric, we can see a similar story, where significant demand supported the rally into the ATH, and was followed by a period of compression and consolidation.
This underscores the an equilibrium being established between supply and demand over the past 3-months. We can also see that realized losses have not ticked meaningfully higher thus far, suggesting limited panic, despite the market correcting over -25% from the highs.
Live Workbench
Net Sell-Side
If we consider exchange inflows of BTC and ETH as sell-side pressure, we can compare this to the inflow volumes of stablecoin, representing a proxy for demand. By this metric, we are able to assess the overall balance between buy-side or sell-side bias in the market.
We can consider this via the following framework:
Values near zero suggest an neutral regime
, where buy-side inflows are of an equivalent magnitude to sell-side pressure from the major two assets.
üü¢
Positive values suggest a net buy-side regime
, where stablecoin buy side exceeds sell-side by the major assets.
üî¥
Negative values suggest a net sell-side regime
, where sell-side volumes exceed the available new stablecoin capital to absorb it.
As we can see, the market has been experiencing a net sell-side regime since mid-2023, however this has been on the decline over the last few months.
Live Workbench
We see a similar dynamic using the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric. This tool measures the net difference between buying and selling trade volumes on centralized exchanges.
From this perspective, we can see the significant sell-side dominance since the March ATH. However, as of last week, CVD has recorded the first net-buy-side indicator since July, suggesting a softening of sell-side pressure applied to spot markets.
Live Chart
Investor Profitability Remains Robust
As Bitcoin prices traded down to the local low of $53.5k, the proportion of the coin supply held at an unrealized loss spiked to around 25% of the coin supply. This brought the Percent Supply in Profit metric back down towards its long-term mean of 75%, which is a level it has historically visited during previous bull market corrections.
Live Workbench
By segregating the percent of the coin supply in profit by Long and Short-Term Holders, we can evaluate the impact of the price contraction on these two cohorts.
Across the last 30-days, the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort experienced a dramatic decline in profitability, with more than -66% of their supply moving into an unrealized loss. This is one of the largest declines in STH profitability on record.
This suggests that a significant number of ‚Äú
top buyers;
have seen their portfolio profitability challenged in recent weeks.
However, for the opposing cohort, the Long-Term Holders, they have experienced a negligible shift in the proportion of their supply held in profit. This demonstrates that relatively few investors from the heights of the 2021 bull still hold onto their coins.
Overall, this indicates that the STH cohort remain the primary group who are most likely to respond to market volatility, with their average cost basis is currently at around 64.3k.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
Examining the magnitude of major sell-side forces, Miners have historically been a primary source of sell-side pressure, however, we note a diminishing return on their market impact with each successive halving. Alternatively, the relevance of ETF Flows and Centralized Exchanges on price action grows convincingly.
The Bitcoin market absorbed a significant 48k BTC across the last month as the German Government achieved a full distribution of their balance sheet. This complete exhaustion of the German Government sell-side pressure has provided the market with ample relief, whilst initial glimmers of a renewed demand-side have stimulated positive price action.
Short-Term Holders have endured a challenging month with the recent correction placing a substantial portion of their coin supply into a position of loss. Alternatively, mature investors remained steadfast, experiencing a near negligible decline in profitability, highlighting their impressive conviction and robust market positioning."

Perpetual Pivots
The perpetual futures markets are the deepest and most liquid trading venue for digital assets. The trade volume is often orders of magnitude greater than spot markets, and it is a preferred instrument for executing trades, speculative positions, and arbitrage strategies.
In this section, we aim to introduce a framework which utilizes the perpetual futures market to identify market pivot points. It seeks to identify points where over-leveraged speculators are liquidated during a bull market correction.
In 2024, open interest across perpetual futures has ranged between 220k and 240k BTC. This value often decreases quickly during deleveraging events and increases during more speculative periods. More recently, open interest has risen into the 260k to 280k BTC range, indicating an elevated appetite for speculation since early June.
Live Chart
To better understand the mechanics of the perpetual markets, we have measured the share of the top three exchanges by open interest.
As shown below, Binance, Bybit and OKX comprise around 84% of the market share, and will therefore, focus on metrics related to these exchanges for our analysis.
Live Workbench
A pivot point in the perpetual market usually involves a considerable reduction in open interest, often a direct result of margin call liquidations of traders holding highly leveraged positions.
The chart below highlights periods where open Interest of the top three exchanges dropped more than 5% over a weekly period. Over the last 12 months, we have encountered ten of these perpetual futures flush-out events.
Live Workbench
To assess the size of contracts forcefully closed, we measure the total liquidation volume during these deleveraging events. The chart below shows that the overall liquidation volume (both long and short) surged above the typical bull market baseline of $200M/day. This demonstrates the role of margin call liquidations in the open interest decline noted in the chart above.
Live Workbench
Directional Bias
During market turmoil, deleveraging events can occur when the market moves in either direction. However, in this instance, we are exclusively isolating for potential pivot points during the bull market corrections and have therefore segregated the liquidations into two subsets:
üü¢
Long-Dominant Liquidations
where more than 50% of liquidated positions were on the long side of the contract
üî¥
Short-Dominant Liquidations
where more than 50% of liquidated positions were on the short side of the contract
During the recent sell-off to $55k, we can see an ideal long liquidation candidate pivot point was recorded. Here, over-leveraged long positions were liquidated, which led to a sharp decline in open interest across the top three perpetual futures exchanges.
Live Chart
Next, we can establish a framework to spot these pivot points using the perpetual funding rate. This approach utilizes the 7-day moving average of funding rates across the top three exchanges.
This is an extremely insightful metric which provides information on the directional bias of positions within perpetual markets. When the weekly average of the funding rate is above the neutral level (0.01% per 8 hours), it suggests there is a large demand from market takers to open a long position.
After setting the current ATH at $73k in March 2024, there has been waning demand for long positions across perpetual markets. Alongside this, the second attempt at rallying above $73k in May saw sentiment briefly switch to positive. However, the overall sentiment regime has remained neutral to negative since then.
The latest rally from the $54k region has been a great example of over-leveraged long positions being liquidated near the local lows. Funding rates residing below the 0.01% neutral level suggest that there has not been a rush for new long positions to open since the July low was established.
Live Chart
Short-Term Profitability Improves
The recent price surge has also been a welcome relief for Bitcoin Short-Term Holders (STHs), a proxy for new demand and recent buyers. This cohort saw over 90% of their supply fall into a loss in late July, putting them into a financially stressful position.
This rally has now broken back above the STH cost basis and returned 75% of their held supply to an unrealized profit. This can be seen within the STH-MVRV metric, which has now recovered above the break-even level of 1.0.
Live Chart
We can increase the granularity of this assessment by inspecting the individual age breakdowns of the Short-Term Holder MVRV metric. We can use this lens to see how profitability has changed across sub-groups of recent buyers. The ages we analyze range from very recent buyers (1-day to 1-week), right through to those on the brink of transitioning into Long-term Holder status (3 to 6-months).
üî¥¬†1d-1w MVRV: 1.05
üü†¬†1w-1m MVRV: 1.1
üîµ¬†1m-3m MVRV: 1.0
üü£¬†3m-6m MVRV: 1.07
At present, all constituents of the Short-Term Holder cohort have returned to positive profitability, which highlights the strength of the prevailing uptrend. This is likely to be positive for overall investor sentiment.
Live Workbench
Finally, we can evaluate the net realized profit/loss for each sub-cohort, which can be considered a measure of net capital flows. This metric also shows signs of constructive improvement, with most age constituents experiencing a positive capital flow, with the only exception being bar the 1m-3m cohort.
This 1m-3m cohort has carried the brunt of the recent range-bound and downside price action and is also one of the larger age bands in this study.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Perpetual futures markets are the most liquid and deep instruments within the digital asset markets, making them a valuable market information source. As BTC prices traded down into the $53k region, it resulted in a meaningful deleveraging event, as many long-biased traders were liquidated near the lows.
The recovery price bounce has also been very strong, returning a majority of Short-Term Holders to an unrealized profit. This has provided much-needed financial relief and is supported by a period of net positive capital inflows over recent weeks."

After an exacerbated legal process, Mt.Gox Creditors are at last receiving the Bitcoin recovered from the infamous exchange hack. As of current, 59k of the recovered 142k BTC has been distributed to creditors via the Kraken and Bitstamp exchanges.
The proportion of wealth held by new investors is declining, and is well below the levels typically witnessed at macro market tops. This highlights a general shift in investor behaviour back towards HODLing.
The distribution pressure by the LTH cohort remains relatively light, and is in decline. Alongside this, Long-term investors currently hold 45% of the network wealth, which is relatively elevated compared to levels seen near macro cycle topping events.

Mt.Gox Distribution Arrives
After over a decade of legal process, the long-awaited creditor distribution of Bitcoin recovered from the Mt.Gox exchange collapse is underway. This marks a historical event for the Bitcoin industry, and especially for the patient and resilient creditors who fought a long, hard battle to be reimbursed in BTC rather than fiat currency.
From a psychological perspective, this represents the final chapter in a major market overhang over the industry since 2013.
The total recovered coin volume was over 141,686 BTC, and just under 59k BTC has now been redistributed to creditors, with another 79.6k BTC soon to follow suit.
Live Chart
Kraken and Bitstamp have been selected as designated exchanges responsible for redistributing creditor funds. Kraken has now received 49k BTC, and Bitstamp has received the first tranche of 10k BTC.
Live Chart
When comparing the size of distribution over the last 2 months, from the Mt.Gox estate to other large entities, we can see that these distributions are already larger in scale than the ETF inflows, issuance to miners, and sell-side by the German Government.
However, it is also worth noting the long history of creditors trying to recover their coins, as it can paint a picture of their likely behavior patterns moving forward:
Creditors opted to receive BTC, rather than fiat, which was new in Japanese bankruptcy law.
Several entities sought to acquire creditor claims throughout the decade-long legal process.
Given the extensive time-span between Mt.Gox collapsing, and today, it is likely many creditors (who didn‚Äôt sell their claims) remain somewhat active in the Bitcoin space.
As such, it is relatively likely that only a subset of these distributed coins will be truly sold onto the market. However, this idea rests on a degree of speculation, and the reality is difficult to measure individually.
Live Workbench
The degree of sell-side pressure by the German Government in late June was tremendous, with over 48k BTC sold over the span of 1-month. Nevertheless, the market absorbed this supply and managed to rally from $53k to over $68k soon after.
The Bitcoin price has continued to trade between $68k and $66k throughout the Mt.Gox distribution, which may allude to a lighter than expected sell-side (thesis above), and/or a relatively resilient demand profile.
Live Workbench
With the knowledge that both Kraken and Bitstamp are the destination exchanges for redistributed coins, we can utilize the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric to add more colour to this idea.
CVD measures the net difference between spot buying and selling trade volumes on centralized exchanges (market orders only).
If we isolate the CVD metric related to Kraken, we can see a marginal uptick in sell-side pressure following the distribution. However, this remains well within typical day-to-day ranges.
Live Chart
For Bitstamp, we can see a similar story, with only a marginal bias towards sell-side dominance.
This adds a bit more evidence to our thesis that creditors may be better thought of as having the mindset of long-term holders for the time being. If this thesis holds, it is a remarkable observation, as the incentive for creditors to take profits is very large due to the substantial price increase since 2013.

Bitcoin bull markets naturally attract sell-side pressure, as higher prices incentivize long-term holders to take profits on some of their holdings. We can observe this phenomenon through the significant decline in the Supply Last Active 1y+ and 2y+ metrics throughout March and April.
This describes long-term investors spending and selling coins to satisfy new demand in the run-up to the $73k ATH. The rate of decline across these curves has slowed of late, suggesting a gradual return to HODLing dominant investor behavior.
üî¥ Supply Last Active 1y+: 65.8%
üü° Supply Last Active 2y+: 54.9%
üü¢ Supply Last Active 3y+: 46.4%
üîµ Supply Last Active 5y+: 31.3%

The Realized Cap HODL Wave metric helps us segregate the USD wealth locked in coins held for less than three months. This allows us to evaluate the waves of in-flowing demand by new investors
The culmination of a euphoric bull market is often marked by a saturation in wealth held by these new buyers, which also represents a point of large-scale divestment by long-term holders.
At the moment, the proportion of wealth held by new investors is declining and well below the levels typically witnessed at macro market tops. This highlights a general shift in investor behaviour back towards HODLing, but also a general slow-down in new demand since the $73k ATH.
Live Chart
If we inspect the cohort who have held their coins for 3- and 6-months, we can see a significant growth in their relative network wealth. This again suggests a general trend of investors active earlier in the year holding their coins dormant and maturing into increasingly senior age bands.
From this, we deduce that HOLDing is likely the dominant mechanic within the Short-Term Holder cohort.
Live Chart
If we flip and look at the opposite side of the equation, the long-term holders, we can investigate the behaviour of investors who acquired supply more than 6-months ago.
Long-term investors currently hold 45% of the network wealth, which is relatively elevated compared to near macro cycle topping events. This underscores that long-term holders hold the coins in HODL mode and are arguably patiently waiting for higher prices to divest into market strength.
Live Chart
Comparing the total balance held by both Long and Short-Term Holders, we note that a new divergence is underway. The supply of long-term holders is increasing, and the supply of short-term holders is declining.
The chart below shows that the approximate age boundary separating LTHs and STHs is for coins acquired before/after late Feb 2024, when the price was around $51k. Likely, many of the coins acquired during the height of the ETF-hyped run-up will soon start migrating into LTH status, and this divergence is likely to accelerate.
Live Workbench
Finally, we can utilize the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator to profile and visualize the intensity of HODLer distribution pressure.
The distribution pressure by the LTH cohort remains relatively light and is declining. This provides further confluence behind our general thesis that the Bitcoin supply remains dominated mainly by longer-term, high-conviction investors. HODLing remains the preferred strategy for the time being.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Finally, the long-awaited Mt.Gox distribution is occurring, a substantial victory for the creditors who fought tooth and nail for reimbursement in BTC and not fiat. Albeit, due to the rampant price increase across the decade, a non-trivial degree of sell-side pressure from the recipients can be assumed.
Nevertheless, the profile of the creditors appears to represent one of a HODLer or long-term investor, potentially dampening the magnitude of sell-side pressure across the coming weeks.
Alongside this, the balance sheet of Long-Term Holders continues to grow, while their proportion of network wealth held remains substantially high compared to prior macro topping events. This suggests that the predominant market mechanic has transitioned to one of HODLing, as mature investors wait for higher prices to part with their coins."

A ‚Äúcorrelation 1‚Äù event has seen major assets and equities decline markedly, with Bitcoin being no exception, recording its largest drawdown of the cycle.
The price contraction has resulted in the BTC spot price reaching the Active Investor Price, located at $51.4k, which is a crucial level for investor psychology.
A dramatic flush out of leverage has also occurred, with futures open interest declining by 11% in one day. This likely increases the importance on on-chain data moving forwards.

Selling-Off
Periods of widespread decline across global markets are typically infrequent, occurring at points of acute global stress, deleveraging, and heightened geopolitical risk. On Monday 5-Aug, equities and digital assets sold off sharply, as the unwinding of the yen-carry trade deleveraged markets, and US treasuries rallied on fears of a recession.
Bitcoin recorded a drawdown of -32% from the ATH, the most severe of the current cycle.
Live Workbench
To assess the severity of the price contraction, we can utilize the well-known Mayer Multiple, which is the ratio between Price and the 200-day moving average. The 200DMA is widely considered a point of delineation between bullish and bearish market conditions by traders and investors.
Currently, the Mayer Multiple is trading at a value of 0.88, which is the lowest since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.
Live Workbench
Key On-Chain Pricing Levels
Moving into the on-chain domain, we can assess the severity of the sell-off using the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, as well bands representing a -1 standard deviation move below. This helps us evaluate how the profitability of new investors has changed during volatile price action.
üü†¬†Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis:
$64,300
üîµ¬†Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis -1SD:
$49,600
The Spot price crashed to within touching distance of the -1SD pricing band, with only 364 / 5139 (7.1%) trading days recording a deviation below the pricing level. This underscores the sharp pace of the market decline.
Live Workbench
We can also assess these market dynamics through the lens of Short-Term Holder MVRV, which gauges the magnitude of unrealized profit, or loss held across the new investor cohort.
Short-Term Holders are currently holding the largest unrealized loss since the FTX implosion, which again highlights a point of serious investor stress imposed by current market conditions.
Live Chart
If we evaluate the percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply held in profit, we can see that just 7% of their supply is held in a profitable position, and is similar to the sell-off in August 2023.
This is also more than -1 standard deviation below the long-term average for this metric, and suggests a notable degree of financial stress amongst recent buyers.
Live Workbench
The True-Market Mean ($45.9k) and the Active Investor Price ($51.2k) both provide estimates of the average cost basis for investors who are active within the current cycle. These models attempt to discount lost and long dormant coins.
The position of the spot price relative to these two key pricing levels can be considered as zone of interest for differentiating between macro Bull and Bear markets.
üî¥¬†Active Investor Price:
$51.2k
üîµ¬†True Market Mean:
$45.9k
The market did find support near the Active Investor Price, which suggests a cohort of investors provides buy-side support near their longer-term cost basis. Should the market decisively break below these two pricing regions, if would require a significant re-evaluation of bull market structure, and would indicate a large proportion of the market is now underwater.
Live Workbench
Realized Losses Spike Higher
In the previous section, we evaluated the position of the market relative to levels where investors are likely to be under serious financial pressure. The next step is to assess the investor response, by analyzing the magnitude of losses locked in during the event.
The sell-off triggered a surge in panic by investors, with around $1.38B in realized losses locked in by market participants. In absolute terms, this is the 13th largest event in history on a USD denominated basis.
Live Chart
We can decompose these losses by Long or Short-Term holder cohorts to identify which groups were most affected. Remarkably, 97% of all losses can be attributed to Short-Term Holders, and the Long-Term Holder cohort were comparatively unfazed.
Therefore, we will focus on the Short-term Holder cohort as the centrepiece for loss analysis moving forwards.
Live Workbench
Isolating for Short-Term Holders, we note that the Z-Score of their Realized Loss has recorded a 6.85 standard deviation move, with only 32 trading days ever hitting larger value. This highlights the severity of the sell-off event in a historical context.
Live Workbench
This sentiment is echoed across the STH Realized Profit / Loss Ratio, which collapsed to historically low values, with only 6% of trading days recording a lower value.
This indicates that the primary reaction from investors was one of panic and fear, as coins were sold well below their original acquisition price.
Live Workbench
Short-Term Holder SOPR has also reached staggering depths, as new investors locked in a -10% loss on average. This speaks to a form of capitulation, with only 70 trading days ever registering a lower value.
Live Chart
Derivatives Flush Out
In derivatives markets, a large volume of long positions were forced closed, with a total of volume of $275m worth of long contracts liquidated. Additionally, an extra $90m was liquidated from the short-side, for combined total liquidation volume of $365m. This demonstrates how many leveraged speculators were purged from the market.
Live Workbench
This forced closure of positions resulted in a -3 standard deviation decline in futures open interest, equivalent to an -11% reduction in one day. This likely represents a complete reset across futures markets, and suggests that spot and on-chain data will provide key insight into the recovery process in the weeks ahead.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
August has already been a exceptionally eventful month across both equity and digital asset markets, after a ‚Äúcorrelation-1‚Äù event sparked a major market sell-off. Bitcoin recorded its largest drawdown (-32%) from the ATH of the cycle, and precipitated a statistically significant capitulation amongst Short-Term Holders.
Futures liquidations fuelled the fire, with over $365m worth of contracts forced closed, and creating a 3 standard deviation reduction in open interest. This has led to a meaningful flush out of leverage, and paves the way for on-chain and spot market data to be of key importance for analysts assessing the recovery in the weeks to come."
2024,33,2024-W33,2024-08-12,2024-08-18,Bullish,59358.78,58437.90,59002.94,-1.55,Disagree,"Executive Summary
After several months of relatively heavy distribution pressures, the behavior of Bitcoin holders appears to be rotating back towards HODLing and accumulation.
Activity in spot markets shows that there has been a net bias towards sell-side pressure of late, and this has not yet completely subsided.
Compared to ATH breaks in past cycles, there is currently a relatively large percentage of network wealth held by the Long-Term Holder cohort.
Overall, on-chain conditions speak to an undertone of high conviction amongst the Bitcoin holder-base.

A Return to HODLing
As the market begins to slowly recover from the sell-off last week, there is a discernible level of uncertainty, and indecision amongst digital asset investors. Nevertheless, when analyzing the onchain response of investors to these choppy market conditions, a trend of a preference for HODLing is beginning to emerge.
Since the Bitcoin price ATH was established in March, the market faced an extensive period of supply distribution, with participation by wallets of all sizes. Over the last few weeks, this trend is showing early signs of reversing, particularly for the largest wallet sizes which are often associated with ETFs. These large wallets appear to be returning to a regime of accumulation.
Live in Glassnode Engine Room
The Accumulation Trend Score (ATS) metric assesses a weighted balance change across the market. This metric also suggests there is a shift back towards accumulation dominant behavior.
The aforementioned shift towards accumulation has contributed to the ATS recording its highest possible value of 1.0, suggesting significant accumulation throughout the last month.
Live Chart
This observation is echoed across Long-Term Holders (LTH), who heavily divested during the run up to the ATH. This cohort have now returned to a preference for HODLing, with a total volume of +374k BTC migrating into LTH status over the last 3-months.
From this, we can infer that the propensity for investors to hold onto their coins is now a larger force relative to their spending pressures.
Live Chart
We can also assess the 7-day change in LTH supply as a tool to assess rates of change in their aggregate balance.
We can see substantial LTH distribution, typical of macro topping formations, into the March ATH. Fewer than 1.7% of trading days have ever recording a larger distribution pressure. More recently, this metric has returned to positive territory, indicating that the LTH cohort are expressing a preference for holding onto their coins.
Live Workbench
Despite the aggressive distribution from April to July, the spot price has continued to trade above the Active Investor Cost Basis, which represents the average acquisition price of active coins in the market.
The Active Investor‚Äôs Cost-Basis can be considered as a key threshold delineating bullish and bearish investor sentiment. Since the market managed to find support near this level speaks to a degree of underlying strength, suggesting investors are generally still anticipating positive market momentum in the short-to-medium-term.
Live Workbench
Evaluating Bias in Spot Markets
With the market within a technical downtrend, we can employ the CVD metric to estimate the present net balance between market buying and selling pressure in spot markets.
This metric can in turn be used to assess mid-term market momentum, as well as any headwinds or tailwinds for price. Since the formation of a new ATH, we note there has been a consistent regime of net sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
Positive CVD values suggest a net buy-side pressure, where as negative values infer a net sell-side pressure.
When we analyze the yearly median value of Spot CVD, we can see that the median value has fluctuated between -$22m and -$50m over the last 2 years, suggesting the presence of a net-sell side bias.
Live Workbench
If we consider this long-standing median as a baseline for CVD equilibrium, we can produce an adjusted variant of the metric, accounting and correcting for this implicit sell-side bias.
When comparing the Adjusted Spot CVD (30d SMA) against the Monthly Percentage Price Change, an intriguing confluence can be found.
Under this framework, the recent failure to break above the $70k zone can be partially explained by weakness in spot demand (negative adj-CVD). Alternatively, a potential recovery of demand in the spot market can be confirmed when the Adj-CVD metric returns to positive values.
Live Workbench
Cycle Navigation
Choppy sideways price action in recent months has motivated a notable slow-down in the distribution pressure by LTHs. This has led to the percentage of network wealth held by this cohort to firstly stabilize, and then recommence growing.
Despite the substantial sell-side pressure by LTHs into the market ATH, wealth held by longer-term investors remains historically elevated when compared to previous all time high breakouts.
This indicates that there is a potential for further divestment pressure by LTHs should the BTC price appreciate in the future. It also suggests that even though prices have traded sideways, to downwards of late, these investors are increasingly unwilling to part ways with their coins at lower prices.
Both of these observations speak to a more patient and resilient holder-base, despite choppy market conditions.
Live Chart
Finally, we can bolster this assessment using the LTH Sell-Side Risk Ratio. This tool gauges the absolute sum of realised profit and loss locked in by investors, relative to the size of the asset (the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.
The LTH Sell-Side Risk ratio remains at a lower level compared to prior ATH breaks. This implies that the magnitude of profit taken by the LTH cohort is comparatively small relative to previous market cycles. This also infers that this cohort is waiting for higher prices before ramping up their distribution pressure.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
Despite challenging and choppy market conditions, Long-Term Bitcoin Holders remain remarkably steadfast in their conviction, with evidence they are ramping up accumulation behaviour.
An elevated percentage of Bitcoin network wealth is held by this investor cohort relative to previous cycle ATH breaks, which suggests there is a degree of investor patience on display, and waiting for higher prices. Additionally, the lack of panic selling amongst this cohort in lieu of the largest price contraction of the cycle highlights a resilience of their aggregate conviction."
2024,34,2024-W34,2024-08-19,2024-08-25,Bearish,59452.67,64251.93,61790.73,8.07,Disagree,"Executive Summary
Since the cycle low established in Nov 2022, Bitcoin Dominance has continued to climb, now commanding 56% of the total crypto market capitalization.
Despite tumultuous and choppy price action, the conviction of Long-Term Holders remains steadfast and unfazed, with a clear preference to accumulate and HODL coins.
Short-Term Holders have carried the brunt of the losses during the recent downturn. However, the degree of locked-in losses suggests a possible overreaction towards the event.

Market Overview
Since the cycle low established in Nov 2022, capital continues to accrue towards the major asset end of the digital asset risk curve. Bitcoin Dominance has risen from non-trivial 38% in Nov-2022 to a staggering 56% of the total digital asset market today.
As the second largest asset in the ecosystem, Ethereum has recorded a dominance decline of 1.5%, remaining relatively flat over the past two years. Stablecoins and the wider Altcoin sector have experienced a more pronounced decline of 9.9% and 5.9%, respectively.
üü†¬†Bitcoin Dominance: 38.7% (Nov 2022) ‚Äî> 56.2% (Current)
üîµ¬†Ethereum Dominance 16.8% ‚Äî> 15.2%

üü£¬†Altcoin Dominance 27.2% ‚Äî> 21.3%
Live Workbench
However, when we assess the Net Capital Change across the major assets, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stablecoins exhibit a net positive capital inflow. Only 34% of trading days have seen a larger 30-day USD inflow, even though the market has generally contracted since the March ATH.
Live Workbench
Next, we can utilize the Major Asset Buy-Side vs Sell-Side metric, which seeks to identify shifts in capital depending on the preference of exchange inflow volumes. This can be considered under the following framework:
Values near zero suggest a neutral regime
, where buy-side inflows are the same magnitude as BTC+ETH sell-side inflows.
üü¢
Positive values suggest a net buy-side regime
, where buy-side inflows of stablecoins exceed BTC+ETH sell-side inflows.
üî¥
Negative values suggest a net sell-side regime
, where buy-side inflows of stablecoins are less than BTC+ETH sell-side inflows.
Since the new ATH creation in March 2024, sell-side pressure has subsided and is now recording the first positive data point since June 2023 ($91.8M/day).
Live Workbench
Long-Term Holders
Amidst tumultuous market conditions as of late, Long-Term Holders have been locking in a reasonably consistent $138M in profit per day. With each transaction, a buyer and a seller are matched, with supply and demand imbalances resolved via price changes.
Therefore, we can infer that this ~$138M/day in LTH sell-side pressure is a read for the daily capital inflows required to absorb supply and keep prices steady. While market conditions have been choppy, prices are generally flat over the last few months, suggesting a form of equilibrium is being reached.
Live Workbench
The Realized Profit / Loss Ratio for Long-Term Holders is a metric we can use to assess cyclical behavior of this cohort. We note that this metric remains elevated, although is experiencing a substantial decline from the peak. This indicates that long-term investors are in the process of cooling off profit-taking activities.
Notably, during the March 2024 ATH, this metric reached a similar altitude to prior market tops. In both the 2013 and 2021 cycles, the metric declined to similar levels prior to resuming an uptrend in price. In 2017-18, however, this decline was one way, as the market entered a loss-dominant bear market.
Live Workbench
From the perspective of Long-Term Holder SOPR, we can see that coins are locking in an average profit margin of +75%, and LTH-SOPR remains elevated at this time.
Live Chart
Utilizing our Binary Spending Indicator for LTHs, the aforementioned slowdown in Long-Term Holder spending can be seen.
LTH supply is rapidly increasing at present. When we consider that the 155-day threshold for LTH status is near the March ATH, this provides an indication of the volume of supply acquired during the ATH run-up, which remains held. This highlights that HODLing behavior is significantly outpacing spending behavior.
Live Workbench
A Psychological Correlation
Moving toward the inverse cohort, the Short-Term Holders, we can measure the intensity of unrealized financial stress experienced by recent buyers. We can observe this dynamic using the STH-MVRV Ratio metric, with a 30-day average applied.
STH-MVRV has recently contracted below the equilibrium value of 1.0, suggesting that the average new investors now hold an unrealized loss.
Periods of brief unrealized loss pressure are common during bull markets. However, sustained periods where STH-MVRV trades below 1.0 can lead to a higher likelihood of investor panic and precede a more severe bearish market trend.
Live Chart
With unrealized losses increasing, an expectation of an eventual investor capitulation grows. Such events are characterized by significant losses being locked in via spent coins.
Evaluating the periods of high-loss realization in the market by new investors can be seen when STH-SOPR trades below 1.0.
From this lens, we can also see that STH-SOPR trades below 1.0, indicating a degree of realized loss-taking activities by new investors. This adds weight to the case that the market is at a decision point, and the price is marginally below the comfort point of STHs.
Live Chart
Despite the correlation between unrealized and realized activities, new investors can overreact to their portfolio being held at a relatively high unrealized profit (or loss). Such over-reactions are a key feature of markets, where the emotional response of investors results in their realizing an excessive profit (or loss) at inflection points, forming both local and macro tops (or bottoms).
The chart below compares the spent cost-basis of new investors who decided to transact against the average cost-basis of all investors who still hold. The deviation between these two metrics provides insight into the magnitude of potential overreactions.
The bull market corrections seen throughout our current cycle have experienced only a slight deviation between the spent and holding cost basis. From this, it could be argued a modest overreaction may have occurred as the market sold off below $50k.
Live Workbench
Navigating Investor Cycles
In the above section, we utilized the MVRV and SOPR metrics, which consider investors' general profit and loss positioning. This section will isolate solely for coins held and transacted in a loss.
By evaluating the Relative Unrealized Loss metric for new investors, we can directly measure the unrealized financial stress that new investors are shouldering.
Presently, the magnitude of Unrealized Loss relative to the STH Market Cap remains relatively low compared to historic capitulation events. The magnitude of loss held by the market is arguably similar to prior bull market corrections.
Live Chart
However, we can see a divergence in this correlation when we compare the build-up of Unrealized Losses to those locked in by spent coins (Realized Losses). Realized Losses tricking notably higher highlights the moderate overreaction we described above.
Live Chart
Assessing the cumulative 90-day realized loss and the average unrealized loss for STHs, we can visually highlight the confluence and correlation between these two measures.
During cyclical price lows, the magnitude of realized and unrealized loss tends to spike between 10% and 60% of total STH holdings. By this measure, the magnitude of both unrealized and realized losses remains relatively small compared to previous major bottom-forming events.
One constructive analogue would be the similarity between the current structure and the 2016-2017 cycle, where the described relative metrics traded below a consistent ceiling of ~10%.
From this, we could argue that the hit taken to investor sentiment may not be as severe as it may seem at face value.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
With a degree of uncertainty rife amongst market investors, capital continues to flow down the risk curve, leading to a significant expansion in Bitcoin dominance, with the leading asset now commanding a staggering 56% of the total market capitalization.
In spite of the tempestuous and choppy price action, the resolve of Long-Term Holders remains resolute, with a clear preference for HODL and acquiring coins. Alternatively, Short-Term Holders have carried the vast majority of the losses across the recent downturn. Nonetheless, the degree of locked-in losses suggests a possible overreaction towards the event."
2024,35,2024-W35,2024-08-26,2024-09-01,Bearish,62840.00,57299.00,59438.59,-8.82,Agree,"Executive Summary
Net capital flows into the Bitcoin assets have markedly cooled, with only marginal profit and loss-taking events by investors.
Loss-taking events are almost exclusively associated with the Short-Term Holder cohort.
However, a significant proportion of supply held by this cohort is transitioning into Long-Term Holder status, having been held for at least 155 days.
Speculation in the perpetual swap market has experienced a full reset, suggesting a cooling off of speculative interest and long-biased leverage.

Liquidity
Over the last few months, net capital inflows into the Bitcoin asset have begun to slow down. This suggests a degree of equilibrium is reached between investors taking profit and loss.
Notably, capital inflows into the Bitcoin market are infrequently this quiet, with 89% of days experiencing a capital inflow larger than today (excluding during loss dominant bear markets). Also of note is that similar periods of inactivity tend to precede a significant uptick in volatility on the road ahead.
The Realized Cap remains at an ATH value of $619B, supported by a remarkable net inflow of $217B since the $15k low established in Dec 2022.
Live Chart
The MVRV Ratio is a powerful tool that enables us to gauge investors' average unrealized profit.
Over the last two weeks, the MVRV Ratio has tested its all-time average value of 1.72. This critical level has historically marked a transition point between a macro bull vs bear market trend. Approximately 51% of trading days have a MVRV value closing above the mean value.
This suggests that investor profitability has essentially reset to an equilibrium position and that the excitement and exuberance after the ETF launch have cooled off completely.
Live Chart
A similar story is echoed in the percentage of supply in profit metric, which provides a read on the global profitability of the supply.
Like the MVRV Ratio, this oscillator has returned to its long-standing mean value. Previous instances where a similar retest of this level occurred are visible in late 2016, throughout the choppy 2019 period and during the mid-2021 sell-off.
Live Chart
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio is another powerful tool which can assess the degree of equilibrium the market has reached. We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
Presently, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has fallen into the lower band, suggesting that most coins moved on-chain are transacting near their original acquisition price. Similar to the metrics covered earlier, this precedes a new regime of heightened volatility.
Live Chart
Short-Term Stress
Diving deeper into these profit and loss-taking activities, we can see that the magnitude of net realized profit/loss is declining.
Net realized profit/loss is currently at a value of +$15M/day, a far cry from the $3.6B/day of capital inflow experienced as the market set the $73k ATH in March. Typically, this metric returns to a neutral level near inflection points such as a continuation of the trend or a reversal back into a macro scale bearish trend.
Live Chart
After setting the ATH in March, the confidence of new investors was tested by choppy sideways price action for several months. During this process, a significant volume of the Bitcoin supply has remained tightly held and is within the 3-month to 6-month age band.
Historically, the supply held within this 3-6m age band tends to peak soon after a major market peak is established, often during the correction which follows. A portion of these new investors then decide to HODL through the choppy conditions, eventually becoming long-term investors. Many others exit their position and realize the loss.
Currently, coins aged 3m-6m account for over 12.5% of the circulating supply, with a structure similar to the mid-2021 sell-off, but also during the height of the 2018 bear market.
Live Chart
The chart below aims to break this cohort down further and compare the supply held within the 3-6m age band vs the supply which has capitulated out at a loss. We start with the held supply aged 3-6m shown in üü†, then overlay the volume transferred in a loss by this cohort üü•.
From this, we can observe a significant surge in loss-taking events since the start of July, whilst the aggregate supply held started to decline. In terms of magnitude, the capitulation was of a scale similar to major market inflection points in the past.
The supply which remains in this age band is increasingly close to migrating into Long-Term Holder status, representing coins that are statistically less likely to be spent on a given day.
Live Chart
Another method for visualizing this migration of coins into LTH status is via the URPD metric, segregated for Long and Short-Term Holders. Here, we can see that over +480k BTC was acquired above the current spot price and is now classified as LTH supply üü¶.
This also means these LTH coins are now held at an unrealized loss.
Live Engine Room
Volatility
In this final section, we will add our analysis of perpetual swap markets, which provide a read on the appetite for speculation and leverage across Bitcoin markets.
In general, there has been a marked decline in liquidation volumes in recent months, especially relative to the excitement around the March ATH. This suggests that the appetite for speculation has declined and suggests a more spot-dominated market regime for the time being.
Live Chart
If we compare the monthly price volatility against the net liquidation volumes, we can see a strong correlation between the two factors. This underscores how market volatility is often amplified by a squeezing of leveraged positions, as traders find themselves offside when the market moves.
Live Chart
We can also look into the ratio between price and net liquidation volume volatility for another relative read on the market's appetite for leverage.
What we find is that this ratio is declining towards levels not seen since Feb 2022. This reinforces the notion that traders are less willing to take on higher-risk positions, suggesting there has been a significant reset in speculative interest.
Live Chart
This phenomenon can also be observed across the broader digital asset ecosystem, with a vast swathe of tokens now displaying a neutral funding rate. This underscores the idea that a major reset in speculative interest has occurred across the entire market, and therefore, spot markets are likely to be in the driver's seat for the near term.
Live Derivatives Engine Room
Summary and Conclusions
A degree of equilibrium is appearing across both the On-Chain domain and the Perpetual Futures Market. This is observable through the languishment of profit and loss-taking activities, as well as the return to neutrality in funding rates materializing across the vast Digital Asset universe. This suggests a significant decline in speculation across market investors, regardless of instrument or asset class.
Alongside this, the market has remained within a structurally ordered downtrend for over 5 months as a period of consolidation and accumulation ensues. However, with respect to historical preference, periods of quiet and calm market structure are short-lived and often precede an expectation for heightened volatility."

On average, BTC investors hold relatively small unrealized losses compared to prior cycles, suggesting a relatively favourable overall position.
However, Short-Term Holder unrealized losses remain quite elevated, indicating they are the primary cohort at risk.
Profit and Loss-taking activities remain remarkably light, with critical metrics such as the Sell-Side Risk Ratio alluding to a potential for heightened volatility in the near future.

A Downwards Tilt
Bull Market Correction
Price action has stagnated, and investor sentiment has been apathetic over the last six months. However, a notable change has occurred over the previous three months, with downward pressure increasing and causing the market to experience its most significant drawdown of the cycle.
Nevertheless, from a macro perspective, the spot price is trading around -22% below the ATH, which remains a relatively shallow drawdown compared to historical bull market regimes.
Live Workbench
Current Market Pressures
With downward price pressure increasing, it becomes prudent to assess the unrealized loss held by investors to evaluate the financial stress they are experiencing.
From the perspective of the broader market, unrealized losses remain historically low. Total unrealized losses amount to just 2.9% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is historically low.
This suggests that the aggregate investor remains relatively profitable, even in the face of continued price declines.
Live Chart
If we take the ratio between total Unrealized Profit and Unrealized Loss, we can see that profits remain 6x larger than losses, supporting the above observation. Around 20% of trading days have seen this ratio above the current value, underscoring the surprisingly robust financial position of the average investor.
Live Workbench
Short-Term Concerns
The Short-Term Holder cohort, representing new demand in the market, appears to be shouldering the majority of the market pressure. Their unrealized losses dominate overall, and the magnitude consistently increased over the last few months.
However, even for this cohort, the magnitude of their Unrealized Losses relative to the market cap is not yet in full-scale bear market territory and more closely resembles the choppy 2019 period.
Live Chart
We can bolster the above observation by assessing the STH MVRV Ratio, which has collapsed below the breakeven value of 1.0. This metric trades at levels similar to Aug 2023 during the recovery rally after the FTX failure.
This tells us that the average new investor is holding an unrealized loss. Generally speaking, until the spot price reclaims the STH cost basis of $62.4k, there is an expectation for further market weakness.
Live Chart
We can increase our confidence in this assessment by inspecting the subsets within the STH investor cohort. Presently, all age bands within the STH cohort are holding an unrealized loss, with their average cost basis as follows:
üî¥ 1d-1w: $59.0k
üü† 1w-1m: $59.9k
üîµ 1m-3m: $63.6k
üü£ 3m-6m: $65.2k
Live Workbench
Investor Reactions
Assessing unrealized losses provides crucial insight into the pressure that market investors are experiencing. We can then supplement this with an analysis of the volumes of profit and loss realized (locked-in) to better understand how these investors respond to this pressure.
Beginning with realized profit, we can see a drastic decline following the $73k ATH, indicating that most coins spent since then have locked in increasingly small profit volumes.
Live Chart
Moving toward realized losses, we note that loss-taking events are elevated, and trade is rising toward higher levels as the market downtrend progresses.
The loss-taking events are not yet at the extreme levels seen during the mid-2021 sell-off or the 2022 bear market. However, the gradual higher drift does indicate some fear creeping into investor behaviour patterns.
Live Chart
From the lens of the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, we can see that the total realized profit and loss are relatively small compared to the total market size. We can interpret this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio has declined into the lower band, suggesting that most coins transacted on-chain are doing so close to their original acquisition price. This suggests a progressive saturation of profit and loss-taking activities within the current price range.
Historically, this alludes to an expectation for heightened volatility shortly and is similar to the 2019 period.
Live Workbench
Navigating the Cycle
During downtrends, patience and HODLing naturally become a dominant market dynamic. A substantial amount of Long-Term Holder coins were spent for profit into the March ATH, creating a net supply overhang.
More recently, LTHs have slowed down their profit-taking, and supply accumulated during the ATH run-up is gradually maturing into Long-Term Holder status. However, historical examples of LTH supply increasing like this show that this usually occurs during the transition towards a bear market.
Live Workbench
Compounding the above observation, we note that the wealth held by new-demand investors has declined over recent months as coins mature and transition into Long-Term Holder status.
The percentage of wealth held by new investors did not reach the elevated limits experienced during previous ATH distribution events. This may indicate that the 2024 peak is more aligned with the 2019 mid-cycle high rather than the macro highs seen in 2017 and 2021.
Live Chart
To conclude our analysis, we shall consult a simplified framework for thinking about historical Bitcoin market cycles using key onchain pricing levels:
üî¥
Deep Bear Market:
Prices trade below the
Realized Price
.
üîµ
Early Bull Market:
Prices trade between
Realized Price
and
True Market Mean
.
üü†
Enthusiastic Bull Market:
Prices trade between the
ATH
and
True Market Mean
.
üü¢
Euphoric Bull Market:
Prices trade above the previous cycles
ATH
.
Under this framework, price action remains within the Enthusiastic Bull Market structure, which is a constructive observation. However, in the event of a local downturn, the pricing level of $51k remains a critical area of interest that must be maintained for further price appreciation.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
With Bitcoin residing only a mere 22% drawdown from its ATH, a considerably shallower drawdown than prior cycles, the average BTC investor remains vastly profitable, highlighting the robustness of their positioning.
Nevertheless, the Short-Term Holder cohort continues to carry elevated unrealized losses, indicating they are the primary cohort at risk and the expected source of sell-side pressure in the event of a downturn.
Alongside this, profit and Loss-taking activities remain remarkably light, suggesting a saturation of our current range with critical metrics such as the sell-side risk ratio, which alludes to a potential for heightened volatility in the near future."

Hash Rate remains just shy of ATHs, as continued investment by Miners demonstrates immense conviction in the Bitcoin Network despite depressed revenues.
Investor interactions with exchanges are in decline, with contracting volumes across the board suggesting there is a diminished appetite for investors and trade.
Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are exhibiting outflows, however, investor interest in the Bitcoin ETFs remain significantly larger in scale and magnitude.

Miners
Miners remain fundamental participants in the Bitcoin network and act as the primary production source for new coins. Miners provide the hashing power used to discover the next valid block, with the network autonomously rewarding them with newly issued coins and transaction fees.
This makes mining an exceptionally challenging industry, as they have control over neither the input cost of energy nor the output cost of BTC.
Despite choppy and uncertain market conditions, Bitcoin miners have continued to install new ASIC hardware, pushing the overall hash rate higher (14D-MA), reaching 666.4EH/s, and just 1% shy of the ATH.
Live Chart
As the hash rate increases, so does the target difficulty to successfully mine a valid block. The Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts the difficulty to account for rising and falling hash rate on the network.
Presently, the average required number of hashes to mine a block is 338k exahash. This is the second largest difficulty throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs lifespan, highlighting the ever-growing competitiveness of the mining industry.
Live Chart
Nevertheless, a significant decline in Miner Revenue can be seen since the market price peaked at a new ATH in March. A significant portion of this revenue decline can be attributed to falling fee pressure. This is driven by declining demand for monetary transfers and falling fees generated from Runes and Inscription-related transactions.
Miner revenue associated with the block subsidy remains relatively high due to spot prices trading above $55k, however, remains around 22% below the previous ATH.
Block Subsidy Revenue: $824M
Transaction Fee Revenue: $20M
Live Chart
As revenues decline, we can infer that a degree of income stress may start to develop. We can estimate the percentage of the mined supply spent by miners over a 30-day window to measure whether this is the case.
Due to the competitive and capital-intensive nature of the mining industry, miners have historically needed to distribute a majority of the coins mined to cover input costs. Interestingly, Miners have transitioned from net distribution over the mined supply to now retaining a portion of mined supply in their treasury reserves.
This highlights an interesting development, as Miners tend to be pro-cyclical, being sellers during drawdowns and HODLers during uptrends. The uptick in hash rate and difficulty represents an increasingly expensive production cost for BTC, which may adversely affect miner profitability in the near future.
Live Chart
Settlement Slowdown
The magnitude of volume settled on-chain can also provide colour into the degree of network adoption and health. When filtering for entity-adjusted volume, the network is currently processing and settling around $6.2B worth of transaction volume per day.
However, settlement volume is beginning to fall towards its yearly average, suggesting a marked cooling off in network usage and throughput. Generally speaking, this is a net negative observation.
Live Chart
Reduced Trading Appetite
In an ever-evolving market landscape, centralized exchanges have remained the centrepiece venue for speculation activity and price discovery. Therefore, we can evaluate onchain volumes aggregated across these venues as a proxy for investor activity and appetite for speculation.
Running a similar 30d/365d momentum cross-over for exchange-related inflows and outflows, we can see that the monthly average volume has fallen well below the yearly. This underscores a decline in investor demand and less trading by speculators within the current price range.
Live Chart
Next, we will look at spot trade volumes at exchange venues. Here, we apply a 90d MinMax scalar, which normalizes the value set over a range of 1 to -1 relative to the maximum and minimum values of the selected period.
From this, a similar observation can be ascertained, with spot volume momentum continuing to decay. This adds more weight to the idea that there has been a notable decline in trade activity over the last quarter.
Live Chart
The CVD metric can estimate the present net balance between market buying and selling pressure in spot markets. Utilizing the same methodology, we note that investor sell-pressure has been increasing across the last 90d, contributing toward the downward tilt in price action.
Live Chart
Finally, we can evaluate the momentum of price action for the Bitcoin price. Here, a degree of indecision can be seen, with positive and negative data points occurring over August. This starkly compares to the two previously highlighted indicators, both of which have been decisively negative across the same period.
Live Chart
Combining the MinMax Transformations for Volume, CVD and Price Action, respectively, we are able to produce a Sentiment Heatmap concerning the values of the features between 1 and -1. We can consider this over the following framework:
üü¢¬†Values of 1 suggest High Risk
üü°¬†Values of 0 suggest Moderate Risk
üî¥¬†Values of -1 Suggest Low Risk
All three indicators suggest the market is entering a low-risk zone relative to the last 90 days of data points. Such confluence among the discussed spot indicators can be translated into diminishing ( Spot Volume Momentum ) sell volume ( CVD < 0) while price action is slowly chopping downward. Such a structure may be susceptible to external forces and could potentially break out on either side if the tides shift.
ETFs
The Ethereum ETFs have now followed the launch of the US Bitcoin ETFs in January in August. These two events mark a ‚ÄúCrossing the Rubicon‚Äù event for the Digital Asset Ecosystem, providing US traditional markets with an accessible access point for exposure to the leading two cryptocurrencies.
Starting with the Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that net capital flows in USD have softened since Aug 2024 and are now reporting an outflow of $107M/week.
Live Chart
Demand for the more recent Ethereum ETFs has been relatively tepid, experiencing a net negative outflow. This is driven primarily by redemptions from the Grayscale ETHE product, which has not been counterbalanced by sufficient inflow demand across the other instruments.
On aggregate, the Ethereum ETFs have experienced a total outflow of $-13.1M. This highlights a disparity in the magnitude of demand between BTC and ETH, at least within the context of current market conditions.
Live Chart
To approximate the impact of the ETFs on the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, we have normalized the bias in ETF netflow volume by the corresponding Spot Volumes. This ratio enables us to directly compare the relative weight of ETFs in each market.
As shown in the chart below, the relative influence of ETFs on the Ethereum market is equivalent to a range of ¬±1% of the spot volume, compared to ¬±8% for the Bitcoin ETF. This suggests that despite normalization, the appetite for the Bitcoin ETF remains an order of magnitude larger than its Ethereum counterpart.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
Miners continue to demonstrate immense conviction in the Bitcoin Network, with the Hash Rate just shy of ATHs despite collapsing revenues. However, as Miners tend to be pro-cyclical, being sellers during drawdowns and HODLers during uptrends, a degree of sell-side pressure can be expected in the event of further drawdowns.
Alongside this, Investor interaction with exchanges continues to fall, with contracting volumes across the board, suggesting there is a diminished appetite for investors and trade. This is also apparent across the Institutional landscape, with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs exhibiting net outflows."

Market demand-side remains lacklustre for digital assets, with the magnitude of both capital inflows and outflows remaining small in scale.
HODLing remains the primary investor dynamic, with all measures of actively tradable supply declining and large volumes of coins maturing into Long-Term Holder status.

Demand Side Wanes
The Realized Cap is a foundational metric that provides an assessment of the cumulative capital netflow into and out of the Bitcoin network.
With the market trading in a downward but range-bound manner for the last six months, both capital inflows and outflows have ground to a halt. The Realized Cap has peaked and plateaued at $622B in the previous two months. This suggests that the majority of coins that are being transacted are doing so within proximity of their original acquisition price.
Live Chart
By assessing the Net Realized Profit / Loss metric, we can visualize the Realised Cap's first derivative, the daily change in onchain capital flows for Bitcoin. When this metric is positive, it represents net capital creation (coins transacting in profit) or destruction when the metric is negative (coins moving at a loss).
At present, we can see that both profit and loss forces are largely equal, resulting in a marginal netflow and a general oscillation around the zero bound. This alludes to a degree of equilibrium being established in the market and has some similarities to the Aug-Sep period in 2023.
Live Chart
We can consider the Realized Profit and Loss as a measure of the excess capital required for a seller to part ways with their coin. Thus, under this framework, we can utilize this metric as a proxy for gauging market demand by evaluating the seller's willingness to transact at a premium (profit) or a discount (loss).
The absolute Realized Profit plus Loss has declined significantly since the March ATH, implying that there has been a reduction in overall buy-side pressure within the current price range.
Live Chart
Supply Side Constricts
Having assessed the demand side of the market, it becomes prudent to gauge measures of the supply side to provide a holistic analysis of the two opposing market forces.
The ‚ÄòHot Supply‚Äô metric is one proxy we can use to estimate the coins readily available to trade and transact. This supply volume represents the wealth held within coins aged one week or less. Leaning on the assumption that a short holding time in the market increases the probability that the coin will transact again, as discovered in our study of
Long and Short-Term Holders
, we consider this distinct age group as one of the most readily available in response to market fluctuations.
The wealth currently held by coins aged less than one week has declined into the low liquidity zone, accounting for just 4.7% of the aggregate network wealth. This highlights a continually constricting supply side, as the vast majority of coins are aged older than one week.
Live Chart
We see a similar story told via the supply divergences chart. Here, we profile several measures of ‚Äòavailable supply,‚Äô such as Short-Term Holder and Highly Liquid supply. We compare this against measures of ‚Äòsaved or stored supply‚Äô such as Long-Term Holder or Vaulted supply.
One observation is the prevalence and dominance of HODLing behaviour amongst market participants, leading to a rapid increase in ‚Äòstored supply.‚Äô This speaks to an overall tightening supply side as the volume of coins available to actively transact continues to reduce.
Live Chart
Stablecoin Liquidity Rises
Stablecoins remain the preferred quote currency on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. As such, the growth in total stablecoin capital can be utilized as a proxy for investor demand and appetite.
The Aggregate Stablecoin Supply is on the rise, residing just under the ATH at $160.4B. This can be considered as a constructive sign suggesting the build-up of crypto-native dollar-denominated capital, which is easily able to be exchanged into digital assets. However, we can also infer that this Stablecoin capital is not actively rotating into risk assets at this stage.
Live Chart
The SSR Oscillator compares the Market Capitalization of Bitcoin against the total circulating stablecoin supply. This can be considered under the following interpretation:
When the SSR is low, the current stablecoin supply has more ""buying power"" to purchase BTC
When the SSR is high, the current stablecoin supply has less ""buying power"" to purchase BTC
The divergence between a range-bound Bitcoin market cap and a growing stablecoin supply has pushed the SSR Oscillator to a historic low. This suggests that investor stablecoin-based buying power is increasing, with a recursive effect where higher purchasing power can lead to an improving demand side in the future.
Live Chart
Heightened Volatility Expectations
With price action oscillating within a well-defined range over the last six months, volatility begins to tighten and compress, akin to a coiling spring. After such a lengthy period without a significant macro movement, there is a growing expectation for higher volatility on the road ahead.
We can gauge the compression of market volatility by measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 180 days. By this metric, only Aug 2023 and May 2016 exhibit a tighter 180-day price range. This highlights the relative tightness of the current market structure.
Live Chart
We can support this volatility assessment by using the Sell-Side Risk Ratio. This tool assesses the absolute sum of realized profit and loss locked in by investors relative to the asset size (the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a significant profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio has now dropped below the low-value band, suggesting minimal profit and loss-taking is occurring within the current range. The interpretation here is that equilibrium has been reached, and there is a need for further range expansion to incentivize investors to spend their coins (take profit or loss).
Live Chart
The above assessment is held solely when assessing the Short-Term Holder cohort. Historically, the STH Sell-Side Risk is at one of its lowest values, highlighting a remarkable absence of demand for new investors.
Live Chart
Similarly, the Long-Term Holder Sell-Side Risk Ratio has also dropped below its low-valuation band, suggesting that even mature investors have slowed their onchain interactions within the current price range.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The current state of the Bitcoin market is one of equilibrium and reduced activity. On the demand side, capital flows have slowed significantly, and the Realized Cap remained effectively unchanged over the last two months.
Simultaneously, the supply side is tightening, and there is a notable decline in readily available coins. However, the uptick in stablecoin supplies carries more future purchasing power, creating tension between current inactivity and potential future demand. This creates a sort of coiled-spring effect in the market and alludes to a regime of higher volatility on the road ahead."
2024,39,2024-W39,2024-09-23,2024-09-29,Bullish,63338.87,65600.01,64738.27,3.57,Agree,"Executive Summary
Bitcoin has reclaimed the Short-Term Holder cost basis ($61.9k) and 200DMA ($63.9k) following a 0.50% interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
Short-term holders are under marginally less pressure as prices rise above their cost basis, after a period of net capital outflows.
New investors show a degree of resilience, seen in realized losses being of a relatively small magnitude, suggesting confidence in the overall uptrend.
The perpetual futures market displays a cautious recovery in sentiment, with gradually increasing demand but still below levels seen during strong bull markets.

A Shift in Market Gradient
The capital inflow into the Bitcoin network slowed down after the market reached the March ATH, resulting in diminishing price momentum. This can be confirmed by comparing the smoothed 155-day gradient of Price ‚¨õ against that of the Realized Price üüß.
The market gradient had fallen into negative values over recent weeks, with the realized price gradient being positive, but trending lower. This indicates that the downside in the spot price was more aggressive than the intensity of capital outflows.
Live Workbench
The next chart measures the z-score of these two gradients. Negative values can be interpreted as periods of relatively weak demand, resulting in a sustained contraction of prices.
Using this metric, we can see that the current structure is very similar to the 2019-20 period, where the market experienced an extended consolidation range after a strong rally in Q2-2019.
Live Workbench
New Capital Flow Direction
The current consolidation phase has pushed the spot price below the cost-basis of several short-term holder sub-cohorts since late Jun 2024 (MVRV Ratio <1). This highlights how recent investors have been under financial pressure, nursing increasingly larger unrealized losses.
However, despite many new investors being underwater on their holdings, the magnitude of their unrealized losses are notably less severe than the mid-2021 sell-off, and the March 2020 COVID crash.
Live Chart
When the market enters a prolonged regime of contraction, diminishing returns motivate investors to cash out at lower prices, cutting their losses. Thus, the cost basis of a relatively young supply tails the spot price lower. The repricing of short-term holder supply to lower price values can be characterized as a net capital outflow from the Bitcoin ecosystem.
To gauge the direction and intensity of capital flows from the perspective of new investors, we have constructed an indicator that compares the cost basis of two sub-groups (1w-1m as the fast trace, and 1m-3m as the slow trace).
Capital Outflows
üü™ During downwards trending markets, the cost basis of the youngest coins (1w-1m üü†) declines faster than the older age cohort (1m-3m üî¥). This structure indicates that the overall direction of capital flows is negative, and the intensity of this outflow is proportional to the deviation between these traces.
Capital Inflow
üü¶ During market up-trends, the cost basis of younger coins expands faster than that of the older age band. This indicates that capital is flowing in at a rate proportional to the divergence between these traces.
The cost basis of younger coins is currently trading below that of older coins, suggesting the market is experiencing a net outflow regime. Utilizing this indicator, a sustainable market reversal may be in its early stages of developing positive momentum.
Live Workbench
Confidence of New Investors
As the unrealized losses held by new investors grow during a market correction, their tendency to capitulate at a loss tends to increase accordingly. Short-term holders have been statistically shown to be more sensitive to volatility, making their behavior useful to track around market inflection points.
When checked alongside MVRV by Age, the SOPR by Age indicators show almost identical behavior. This confirms that new investors have both been underwater on their holdings and experienced sufficient stress to crystallize those losses.
Live Chart
We can also assess the intensity of the reaction by Short-Term Holders to any shifts in market sentiment.
The difference between the cost basis of new investors who are spending üü† and the cost basis of all new investors üîµ shines a light on their aggregate confidence. When normalized by the spot price, this deviation enables us to highlight periods when new investors overreact to extremely high unrealized profit or loss conditions.
Over recent months, new investors who acquired their coins over the last 155 days have shown comparatively higher confidence in the market than previous ‚Äòbearish trends‚Äô. The magnitude of losses locked in by this cohort remains relatively low compared to the cost basis of their holdings.
Live Workbench
A Long-Side Perpetual Premium
We can use the perpetual futures market to add another dimension to our investigation of the confidence of new capital in the uptrend. First, we employ the Futures Perpetual Funding Rate (7D-MA) to show the appetite of speculators for paying a higher interest rate to take on leverage for long positions.
Considering the funding rate value of 0.01% is an equilibrium value on many exchanges, we look for deviations above this level as a threshold of bullish sentiment. The recent price bounce has been paired with a relative warming up of long-biased leverage in perpetual markets. This has pushed the weekly average funding rate to 0.05%.
Whilst this is above the equilibrium level, it does not yet indicate a strong or excessive degree of long-biased demand in perpetual markets just yet.
Live Chart
If we calculate the cumulative monthly premium that long-side contracts have paid to the short side over the last 30 days, we can see that the total cost of leverage around the March ATH was around ~$120M per month.
This indicator has plunged to $1.7M per month as of mid-September, with only a modest uptick to $10.8M per month today. Therefore, demand for long-leverage has increased over the last two weeks but is still considerably lower than it was in January 2023. This speaks to a market that has cooled off significantly during this correction.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusion
The Bitcoin market has remained within a lengthy consolidation phase, which is very reminiscent of the period from late 2019 and into early 2020. The capital inflow into the Bitcoin network has slowed down since the March ATH, which has challenged Short-Term Holder profitability.
However, despite experiencing a local period of net capital outflow, the confidence of new investors in the market has been remarkably robust. In recent weeks, there has also been a very modest uptick in long-side bias in perpetual futures markets.
Overall, this paints a picture of a market that has cooled down from the excesses seen in March, whilst not breaking the sentiment of many new Bitcoin investors."

When comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs cyclical price performance since the bear market was low, an uncanny similarity emerges over the prior three cycles, with the index trading at a nearly identical position.
There has been a rise in the number of Long-term Holder coins held in loss, as large volumes of BTC acquired near the $73k ATH mature across the 155-day threshold.
However, the magnitude of unrealized loss held by these investors remains small in scale, suggesting minimal financial pressure imposed on their portfolios.
A clear improvement in Short-Term Holder profitability can be observed throughout the recent rally, providing relief for buyers who recently acquired their coins.
The conviction of US ETF investors remains relatively robust, with only minor sell-side pressure taking place, despite being underwater on average inflow cost basis positions.

Cycle Navigation
The Bitcoin market saw a relief rally back towards the $66k region last week, setting the first technical higher high since June. This price action provides the first inclinations that the structured downtrend may be approaching a phase shift.
The market pulled back to $60k early this week and is trading at $61.7k at the time of writing.
Live Chart
When we assess the price performance of Bitcoin from the cycle low, a remarkable similarity in performance emerges despite wildly differing market conditions. The reason for Bitcoin following such a similar path is a regular topic of debate, but it continues to provide an interesting framework for analysts to think about cycle structure and duration.
Both the 2015-16 üîµ, and 2019-20 üü¢ periods have traded in an oddly similar manner to the recovery seen in 2023-24 ‚ö´.

Deceptive Long-Term Holder Losses
One of the most powerful tools in on-chain analysis is our ability to gauge how many coins are held in profit or loss and the magnitude of unrealized paper gains/losses for investors. We can bolster this using cohorts, with the Long and Short-Term Holder cohorts particularly instructive.
We can compare the Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio to assess the balance between these cohorts. This lens shows a large volume of coins maturing into Long-Term Holder status, pushing this ratio to the highest level since mid-2021.
This suggests that HODLing persists as the dominant behavior of Bitcoin investors.
Live Workbench
However, we are also seeing a notable uptick in Long-Term Holder supply, held at an unrealized loss. This can be attributed to coins acquired in close proximity to the $73k ATH, which are now beginning to mature across the 155-day threshold.
Whilst unrealized losses can be interpreted as a form of financial pressure felt by investors, Long-Term Holder supply tends to remain held throughout periods of volatility.
Live Workbench
If we break down the proportion of total supply held in the loss by long-term holders, we see a surge in their dominance, with this cohort now accounting for 47.4% of all coins in the loss.
Again, similarities to the 2013, 2019, and 2021 periods emerge when investors entered a re-accumulation phase.
Live Workbench
Despite LTHs accounting for 47.4% of the supply held in loss, the magnitude of the unrealized ‚Äòpaper‚Äô losses held within these coins remains relatively small.
This is a constructive observation as it suggests that while many ‚Äòtop buyers‚Äô are technically underwater on their holdings, the scale of their portfolio drawdown is relatively small, and the financial pressure may be interpreted as minimal.
Live Chart
Short-Term Holder Profitability Improves
To balance the equation, we can also look toward the Short-Term Holder cohort, which represents a pool of new demand in the market and tends to be more responsive to market volatility.
The Short-Term Holder MVRV metric describes the average unrealized profit/loss held by short-term holders. Over recent weeks, this metric has experienced several successive undercuts below the equilibrium value of 1, describing an STH cohort that is, on average, holding an unrealized loss.
However, the depth and the duration below 1.0 is unlike that seen during previous bear market structures, such as in 2022. A slight positive divergence is also developing, where the price has generally been flat over the last month, but STH-MVRV is increasing.
Both of these observations suggest that the positioning and profitability of new investors are improving and, similar to the LTH cohort, may not be as financially stressful as in typical bear market conditions.

The percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply held in profit tells a similar story, with over 62% of their supply now held in a profitable position. From this, two key insights can be drawn:
A significant volume of STH coins have a cost basis located between $53k and $66k
A higher high in the percent of STH supply in profit has been established, again suggesting their profitability is improving and easing financial pressure on this cohort.
The recovery also places the Percent Supply in Profit near the long-term average for this metric, which is a noteworthy rebound.
Live Workbench
The STH Realized Profit / Loss Ratio has also rebounded strongly, returning into positive territory and seeing profit-taking volumes 14.17 times larger than for loss-taking. From a structural perspective, this provides an extra layer of confluence that the market is in a superior position relative to just a few weeks ago.
Live Workbench
Institutional Demand
The institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure has been nothing short of phenomenal. The total assets under management within the US Spot ETFs now have a market value of $58B and hold around 4.6% of the circulating Bitcoin supply.
We can also see a recent uplift in the ETF balances on Glassnode due to the inclusion of holdings within the ‚ÄòBTC‚Äô instrument associated with the
Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust
.
Live Chart
With BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale ranking as the largest US Spot ETFs, we can consider the price-stamping of Bitcoin deposits to their ETFs as a method to estimate the average acquisition cost basis. The cost basis of these instruments ranges from $54.9k to $59.1k.
This cost-basis model can then approximate a break-even point for ETF investors as a gauge for psychological stress points based on their unrealized profit/loss. As we can see, the price has tested these ETF break-even levels in three key instances since July.
Live Workbench
With the ETFs being a relatively new piece of the Bitcoin market structure, it is helpful to put their influence on the market into perspective and size them up against the traditional spot markets.
In this final chart, we evaluate the proportion of positive net capital flows associated with introducing ETF instruments.
Next, we compare the value invested into the ETFs üü© to the net capital inflow into the Bitcoin asset overall üî¥, measured as the change in the Realized Cap over the same period.
Since early January, the result shows that a non-trivial 4% to 5% of the overall net capital inflow to the Bitcoin market can be associated with coins flowing into US Spot ETFs. Given that this is aligned with their share of the total supply held, we have a reasonable baseline for evaluating their market influence.
Live Workbench
Summary and Conclusions
The recent market rally has several initial signs that a change in market structure may be beginning to emerge, with Bitcoin printing its first technical higher high since the $73k top.
The Long-Term Holder cohort is largely in a regime of dominant HODLing and accumulation, while Short-Term Holders have seen a notable resurgence in their profitability. Across several measures, the average Bitcoin investor is in a better and more profitable position compared to just a few weeks ago and is experiencing less financial stress across the board."

Bull Market Drawdowns remain relatively shallow but in line with historical bull market uptrends. This highlights both the similarities and the relative resiliency of the current cycle.
Both Short-Term Holder positioning and their spending behaviour have largely improved as the spot price attempts to reclaim the Short-Term Holder cost-basis at $62.5k.
A significant amount of Futures Open Interest remains in place, which may expose the market to deleveraging and liquidation cascades if significant volatility breaks out.

Technical Damage Report
The Bitcoin market is truly unique in that it boasts the deepest liquidity profile at hours where traditional markets are closed for trading, and trades globally in all timezones and jurisdictions. This allows investors to express, trade, and speculate an opinion on the market at any time, which can lead to significant price fluctuations over weekends.
The recent pullback into the $60k region occurred late in the week and was one of the deepest one-day sell-off events since the 2022 cycle low. However, despite the lighter trade volume typically seen over weekends, the market has managed to recover back to close the week at $63.5k.
Live Chart
When we evaluate the depth of corrections measured from the local high during bull markets, the 2023-24 drawdown profile is largely in line with previous uptrend cycles. We can also see a relatively high degree of resiliency on the demand side. The maximum drawdown is -26% on a closing basis, which is somewhat shallower than is typically seen during prior cycles.
However, the last few months have been the deepest of this up-cycle, which suggests that this has been one of the more challenging periods since the FTX collapse in late 2022.
Live Chart
Key Pricing Levels
A key tool within the on-chain analysis toolbelt is our ability to assess the average cost basis of various investor cohorts. This provides insight into the financial pressure various groups of investors are experiencing, measured as a derivative of the unrealized paper gains/losses held.
A particularly interesting cohort for understanding near-term price action is the Short-Term Holder cohort, typically characterized as new market demand. The spot price has just accelerated above and reclaimed its critical cost-basis of $62.5k, which is a sign of a relatively constructive nature.
If the market fails to hold above this level, however, it will put a large cohort of recent buyers under increasing pressure, especially considering the last few months of challenging conditions.
Live Chart
We can also gauge a more macro outlook by utilizing the True-Market Mean ($47k) and the Active Investor Price ($52.5k). Both of these models provide an estimate of the average cost basis for investors who are active within the current cycle (by discounting lost and long-dormant supply).
The position of the spot price relative to these two key pricing levels can be considered a zone of interest for differentiating between macro bull and bear markets.
Year to date, the spot price has traded above both of these price levels, except for a brief excursion below the Active Investor Price during the 5-Aug sell-off. This suggests a relatively robust market, which has tended to provide demand support during market drawdowns.
Live Chart
The
URPD
metric is an extremely useful tool, allowing us to profile the current cost basis of the circulating coin supply. The spot price is located within an extremely large cluster of coins. This suggests that small fluctuations in price can impact the profitability of a substantial number of investors.
The chart below has marked out the URPD with the critical pricing levels noted above, some key observations can be noted:
The STH cost basis resides within the middle of this dense cluster, highlighting its pivotal role in gauging near-term investor sentiment.
Two large supply nodes are located at the True Market Mean and Active Investor Price, underscoring their importance as support levels.
In close proximity to these pricing levels are large ‚Äòair gaps,‚Äô where very few coins have transacted, potentially marking them as points of interest in the event of downside volatility.
This paints a picture of a market that rests on delicate ground, with a large volume of supply likely to be sensitive to the next major market move.
Live Chart
A Short-Term Reset
With Short-Term Holders playing an important role in defining local price action, the balance of their supply held in profit or loss can help distinguish positive or negative tipping points.
By this metric, there is a clear profit dominance amongst Short-Term holders, with this ratio trading at 1.2. This indicator has also recently broken more than one standard deviation above its 90-day mean, suggesting an initial positive boost to investor sentiment may be underway.
Live Chart
From the perspective of Short-Term Holder unrealized profit/loss, we can use a similar analysis framework applied to
STH-MVRV
. These tools assess the magnitude of unrealized paper gains/losses held by this cohort on average.
Here, we can also observe an improvement in the profitability of new investors, with their MVRV ratio rallying from the lows during the yen-carry trade unwind in early August. STH-MVRV has also reclaimed its 90d moving average, which is another positive sign.
Live Chart
With both the Supply in Profit/Loss Ratio and STH-MVRV reaching their respective upper statistical bands, we can theorize that new investors have a decent incentive to lock in profit during the prevailing rally.
Using the same statistical bands applied to
Net Realized Profit/Loss
by STHs, it becomes evident that profit-taking has intensified during this rally. The magnitude of profit-taking remains relatively small when compared to the March ATH. However, it is still significant enough to reach the upper statistical band.
Live Chart
Increasing Speculation in Derivatives Markets
Derivative instruments for Bitcoin remain a crucial component of market structure and have grown significantly over recent years. Despite a surge in the usage of calendar expiring futures, primarily via CME Group instruments, the perpetual swap remains the contract of choice amongst crypto-native traders and speculators.
We can gauge speculation by futures investors by assessing the cumulative monthly premium that long-side contracts have paid to the short-side over the last 7 days.
We can see that the total cost of leverage around the March ATH peaked at around ~$120M per week. This has since declined to just $15.3M per week, reflecting a net reduction in long-biased speculation during the recent range-bound market conditions.
However, despite the meaningful reduction in trader long bias, the directional premium has recently exceeded its +1œÉ band, underscoring a potential return of speculative interest.
Live Chart
A substantial $2.5B of futures open interest was forcibly closed during the rally, suggesting a flushing out of short sellers. However, the percentage of OI reduction seen across the top three perpetual exchanges did not surpass the 5% threshold value üü®.
From this, it could be argued that the market remains somewhat susceptible to heightened volatility in either direction, which could squeeze leveraged traders out of their positions.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Both Short-Term Holder's investment positioning and spending behaviour have seen a boost in profitability over the last month as the spot price rebounds above their cost-basis. Given the delicate position of the spot price relative to the cost basis of a large volume of the circulating supply, this may help tip the balance back in favor of the bulls.
However, speculation appears to be increasing in futures markets, with a significant amount of open interest still in open contracts. With the macro market direction still ambiguous, the market remains vulnerable to heightened volatility, which may fuel the next move in either direction due to deleveraging pressures and liquidations."
2024,42,2024-W42,2024-10-14,2024-10-20,Bearish,66065.65,69014.86,67705.39,4.46,Disagree,"Executive Summary
The demand side of the market has declined notably since the March ATH, with investor attention thinning as the market chops sideways within this price range.
On the supply side, available coins are also constricting, with several measures of ‚Äòactive supply‚Äô compressing to relatively low levels.
Historically, tightness in the Bitcoin supply side has been a precursor for a regime of heightened volatility.
It often describes an equilibrium being reached between the wealth held by new demand and existing HODLers, which tends not to last for very long.

A Waning Demand Side
The rate of new capital inflows has continued to wane since the $73k ATH, set in March 2024. Due to the peer-to-peer nature of the Bitcoin network, buyers and sellers are matched on a 1-1 basis. Thus, measuring the
Realized Profit
or
Realized Loss
metrics can act as proxies for the magnitude of new capital entering or exiting the network.
Using this framework, we can see that the Bitcoin market currently sees around $0.73B in new capital flowing into the network daily, which is not insignificant but notably lower than the $2.97B peak set in March.
Live Chart
An interesting significant spike in Realized Profit can be seen on 8-Oct within the raw, unfiltered variant of this metric. However, the same spike does not show up when looking at the Entity-Adjusted variant pioneered by Glassnode.
This profit spike was caused by a large internal transfer by the
WBTC cluster, as the on-chain ownership structure is migrated by BitGo.
Glassnode‚Äôs proprietary clustering heuristics successfully identified this non-economical transaction and correctly discounted it from the cleaned dataset. This provides a tangible view into the advantages of entity-adjusted filtering of on-chain transaction data.
Live Chart
Our
Point-in-Time
variant of the WBTC Balance shows a strictly append-only metric where their balance history is immutable, capturing the status of our clusters while recording the data point.
From this perspective, we can observe the initial decline in the WBTC balance when it happened and its subsequent return to its previous level, as Glassnode‚Äôs automated clustering algorithm correctly reclassified the transfer as internal.
Live Chart
Returning to our demand-side assessment, we can use the
Binary CDD
metric as another proxy for demand-side pressure. This metric tracks the expenditure of ‚Äòholding time‚Äô in the market, tracking when holders of old supply transact large volumes (balanced by new buyers entering).
We can now see a relatively light volume of coinday destruction, suggesting that long-term investors remain relatively inactive within the current price range.
Our gauges for demand-side intensity suggest investor attention and new demand inflows within this range are relatively muted and have not seen a significant second wave of YTD.
Live Chart
Supply Tightens
After establishing the presence of a somewhat lacklustre demand side of the equation, it is prudent to assess its opposing force, the supply side. Here, we consider ‚Äòsupply‚Äô as the volume of coins market participants are willing to spend and transact with.
The chart below profiles several measures of ‚Äòavailable supply,‚Äô including Short-Term Holder and Highly Liquid supply. We compare these against measures of ‚Äòsaved or stored supply‚Äô such as Long-Term Holder or Vaulted supply.
We can see a multi-month rise in our ‚Äòstored supply‚Äô measures, highlighting a preference for HODLing amongst existing holders. This has led to a subsequent decline in ‚Äòactive supply‚Äô measures, suggesting fewer coins readily transacting within the current price range.
Live Chart
We can also increase the granularity of our ‚Äòavailable supply‚Äô measures. We can assess the 'Warm Supply' cohort, which evaluates the supply using ‚Äòcoin-age‚Äô heuristics and focuses explicitly on coins moved within the last month.
In our
Long-Term vs Short-Term holder classification study
, we quantified that the probability of spending is strongly related to the amount of time the coin has been held. Thus, the ‚ÄòWarm Supply‚Äô captures an effective subset of coins we can reasonably expect to change hands soon.
We can also consider the Futures Open Interest and volume as a form of ‚Äòsupply exposure‚Äô in derivative markets that we expect to be actively traded.
Combined, this active supply measure has effectively halved since the March ATH. This suggests that low trade volumes on-chain and a reduction in Futures market activity highlight a net decline in investor speculation and attention.
Live Chart
The Liveliness metric is an elegant tool which assesses the all-time balance between coinday destruction (spending) and coinday creation (HODLing). We note the substantial increase in spending activity between July and August, which includes the redistribution of Mt Gox coins back to creditors.
The liveliness metric is currently within a sustained downtrend, highlighting a solid preference by market participants to HODL their supply, which further constricts our available supply measures.
Live Chart
Persistent Intra-Cycle Investors
We have now established both a declining demand and a tightening supply side. We can bolster this assessment by inspecting the proportion of network wealth held by these two cohorts. We consider the behaviour of these cohorts under the following framework.
Short-Term Indicator [<1 month]
üî¥ The realized capital or wealth transacted within the last 30 days. This cohort corresponds closely to demand, including new investors deploying fresh capital into the market.
Long-Term Indicator [1-2 years]üîµ
This portion of the supply peaks during the bear market bottom formation phase. This cohort represents the long-term and price-insensitive investors accumulated during and held throughout the bear market.
Directly comparing the wealth of buy-side pressure against HODLer conviction, we note an elevated but declining presence of new demand. New demand is considerably higher than during the 2022 bear market but far below the heights reached in March.
We have not yet seen a sharp and sustained surge in new demand, typically accompanied by cycle peaks. Similarly, we have not started to experience a rise in HODLing pressure, which has historically been witnessed throughout deep bear markets.
This places the current market in a relatively unique period of equilibrium, which is almost a halfway point between two cycle extremes.
Live Chart
We can further inspect this balance of wealth by using the Realized HODL Ratio. The aforementioned halfway point is also reflected here, with an elevated RHODL signalling the presence of new investors but not yet peaked in a way consistent with demand saturation.
Live Chart
The confidence of new investors in the market trend has also remained within the neutral range, highlighting that spending by new buyers is not drastically different from the price of the original acquisition.
Despite the slightly negative sentiment through the recent tumultuous market conditions, the confidence level among new investors is notably higher than both the 2019-2020 and 2021 markets.
Live Chart
New investors lack of unrealized loss further highlights this robustness, underscoring that we have not seen a drastic decline in investor profitability. This suggests there is limited financial pressure and fear experienced by Bitcoin holders, lessening the likelihood of a descent into a deep bear market at this time.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
A notable divergence between supply and demand forces continues to grow. The demand side of the market has declined markedly since the March ATH, while several measures of the ‚Äòactive supply‚Äô continue to compress and constrict. With respect to historical precedence, prior examples of acute tightness across the Bitcoin supply side have been a precursor for a regime of heightened volatility."
2024,43,2024-W43,2024-10-21,2024-10-27,Bearish,67346.15,67943.19,67286.35,0.89,Disagree,"Executive Summary
The Bitcoin spot price has briefly rallied above $69k after successfully clearing several significant technical and on-chain pricing levels.
From an On-chain perspective, all sub-age-groups within the Short-Term Holder cohort now hold an unrealized profit, likely a tailwind for market sentiment.
However, speculation in futures markets is increasing, with open interest surging to new ATHs and a non-trivial portion attributed to the cash and carry basis trade.

Accelerating Price Action
The Bitcoin spot price has caught a bid this week, rallying back to $69k, edging ever closer to the $73k ATH set in March. The market is trading just -6.8% below this peak price, relieving many investors after seven months of sideways and choppy conditions.
When we measure the depth of drawdowns relative to the ATH over time, we can see that the severity of this drawdown is more in line with the 2021 up-cycle and less so with the 2019 and 2022 bear markets.
Live Chart
We can further profile the market's resilience by comparing the spot price and key technical pricing levels. This rally has seen the market break through the combined resistance of the 200DMA üü¢ and the 111DMA üü£, both of which Bitcoin investors tend to respond.
Interestingly, the 365D SMA üîµ has historically acted as either support or stubborn resistance at macro market inflection points. Recently, the 365DMA acted as strong support during the yen-carry unwind on 5 August and, to date, has defined the lower bound of the prevailing macro uptrend.
Live Chart
From the lens of Fibonacci retracement levels, the spot price has been primarily bounded between the ATH and the -23.6% region, acting as a general lower bound throughout the range bound price action.
Bitcoin trading within these bounds for several months is extremely atypical, underscoring how unique this sideways and choppy period has been. Typically, the Bitcoin market rallies to new ATHs or sells off more severely, which intrigues this consolidation period.
Live Chart
Key On-Chain Pricing Levels
Net capital inflows into the Bitcoin asset have also accelerated, increasing by $21.8B (+3.3%) over the last 30 days. This has resulted in the Realized Cap ticking up to a new ATH, reaching over $646B.
This suggests that liquidity across the asset class is rising, and meaningful capital inflows support the price increase.
Live Chart
The AVIV Ratio is a fundamental metric within the on-chain analysts' toolkit, which assesses the magnitude of paper gains/losses held by active investors (by discounting inactive entities such as lost and long-dormant supply).
The AVIV Ratio has traded above its all-time mean YTD and bounced strongly off this mean when the yen-carry-trade unwound on 5 August. Generally speaking, this is a constructive signpost in that it suggests investor profitability remains relatively robust, and active investors have defended their cost basis over recent months.
In addition, we note that the AVIV Ratio has not breached its +1SD level since the March ATH, highlighting the potential room for growth should positive price momentum be established.
Live Chart
We can use key on-chain pricing levels to construct a framework for thinking about Bitcoin market cycles. This can be considered under the following framework:
üî¥
Deep Bear Market:
Prices trade below the
Realized Price
.
üîµ
Early Bull Market:
Prices trade between
Realized Price
and
True Market Mean
.
üü†
Enthusiastic Bull Market:
Prices trade between the
ATH
and
True Market Mean
.
üü¢
Euphoric Bull Market:
Prices trade above the previous cycles
ATH
.
The price is attempting to transition from the Enthusiastic Bull Market regime into the Euphoric Bull Market, distinguished by a sustained break above the 2021 ATH of $69k. This level was briefly breached during the March 2024 peak, however profit taking was too heavy at the time, necessitating a period to cool off investor excitement.
Live Chart
We can also assess the state unrealized profit for the Short-Term Holder cohort, which can be considered a proxy for recent buyers' sentiment in the market.
Presently, the spot price is trading above the average acquisition price of all Short-Term Holder cohort sub-age groups. This means almost all recent buyers hold an unrealized profit, spotlighting the relief this rally has provided investors.
Live Chart
Cash and Carry Intensifies
The derivative market for Bitcoin has experienced immense growth since the first perpetual swap instruments were launched in 2016. Derivatives markets have added significant depth and liquidity to the asset class, allowing for increasingly sophisticated trading and hedging strategies.
Open Interest across both perpetual and fixed-term futures contracts has recorded a new ATH of $32.9B this week, suggesting a marked increase in aggregate leverage entering the system.
Live Chart
Despite the preference for perpetual swap instruments across crypto-natives, the traditional fixed-term futures contract at the CME Group has significantly driven this uptick in open interest.
This product has provided the new wave of institutional investors with an instrument for regulated derivative exposure and an opportunity to capture yield via a cash-and-carry strategy. Open Interest across CME contracts has surged to a new ATH of $11.3B, highlighting increased institutional activity within the digital asset space.
Live Chart
However, the volumes traded across all futures contracts ($35B per day) remain somewhat subdued, especially compared to the elevated volumes when the market peaked at the ATH in March. This suggests that there has not yet been a significant impulse in trading activity and perhaps alludes to a higher dominance of single trade basis strategies and arbitrage positions within futures markets.
Live Chart
The yield available via Cash-and-Carry strategies is around 9.6%, almost double the ‚Äòrisk-free‚Äô rate available from short-term US Treasuries. With additional Fed rate cuts expected in the months ahead, this basis trade will likely continue attracting institutional traders, further expanding market liquidity for Bitcoin.
Live Chart
Further evidence of an increased cash-and-carry trade can be found by comparing the 30D sum of ETF netflows and the 30D change in CME open interest.
üü†¬†30-day sum of ETF net flows
üîµ¬†30-day change in CME open interest
We can see a similar magnitude between these two metrics, which suggests a relationship between long-spot positions via Bitcoin ETFs and a short position via CME futures contracts to capture the yield.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Positive market momentum continues to develop with the Bitcoin market, with the spot price breaking above several key technical and on-chain price levels. This has brought many investor positions back into a state of unrealized profit, likely to be a tailwind for sentiment.
Open interest in futures markets has also expanded recently, reaching a new ATH. The dominance of the CME Group exchange highlights an increasing presence of institutional investors in the digital asset space, with strong indications that a cash-and-carry strategy is in play."

New ATHs
Following many months of consolidation and side-ways price action, Bitcoin has broken to a new ATH, sparked by the high likelihood of President Trump winning the US election. Price successfully cleared the $73.7k level and has rallied to over $75.3k, entering a phase of price discovery and pushing investor sentiment closer to Euphoria.


Live Chart
Growing Liquidity and Rising Profits
Since the start of September, net capital inflows into Bitcoin have increased significantly. This showcases a rising appetite for investors to allocate capital, as well as traders taking profit into market strength.

The Bitcoin Realized Cap has increased by 3.8% over the last 30 days, which is one of the higher inflow levels since January 2023. The Realized Cap is currently trading at an ATH value of $656B, supported by a net 30-day capital inflow of $2.5B.


Live Chart
The explosive wave of profit taking into the March ATH culminated with a peak realized profit volume of +$3.1B.

As the market digested this move over the last seven months, realized profit and loss volumes both subsided towards an equilibrium position. This suggests a complete reset of supply and demand forces has occurred.

Alongside this, we can see a structural increase in profit taking, which is starting to re-emerge, suggesting a new wave of demand is entering the market.


Live Chart
We can also see the shifting market dynamics using the ratio between profit and loss volumes.

The market currently resides in a profit-dominant regime, with the volume of profit realized being a staggering ~47x larger than losses. This reflects the increasingly thin volume of supply held at a loss as the market pushes up to and through to a new ATH.


Live Chart
We can also observe a non-trivial increase in profit-taking volume, which is up by +$635M/day.

While this is a considerable USD value compared to the euphoria experienced near the extremes of previous bull cycles, this remains relatively modest.


Live Chart
ETFs Experience Outflows
Over the month, US Bitcoin ETFs have experienced remarkable demand, recording a surge of inflows which have rivalled the success observed across the product's initial launch.

However, investors appear to have de-risked in the run-up to the US Presidential Election, highlighted by the notable outflows across the last 3 days. Nevertheless, with the formation of a new ATH, ETFs may see new demand and momentum chasers.


Live Chart
Heightened Volatility Expectations
The US Presidential Election has been a dominant focal point for investors, with expectations for heightened volatility being priced in for several weeks. Since 2023, options markets have grown to become a significant component of the Bitcoin market structure, enabling investors to express increasingly sophisticated views on the market.

The amount of open interest deployed across options contracts has surged to a value of $25.2B, with only the March ATH recording a higher value of $30.2B.


Live Chart
Options trade volume is also ticking higher, now reaching a value of $2.9B, also bested only by the volume trading into the March ATH, and during the 5-Aug yen-carry unwind. This again highlights the growing presence of institutional-grade investors, utilizing sophisticated instruments to express their market opinion.


Live Chart
Assessing the ratio between open interest allocated to put and call contracts, there is an even split between both sides. This suggests that investors and speculators have hedged and bet on large market moves in both market directions.


Live Chart
This idea that investors expect rising volatility ahead is also visible in options implied volatility (IV) priced into options.

Currently, we are seeing a surge in IV across all contract expiration dates, most notably across the short-dated 1-week expiration. This confluences that the investors are forecasting and betting on a higher volatility regime both into and after the US election results are known.


Live Chart
By comparing the difference between the options implied volatility and realized volatility over the same time period, we can calculate the volatility risk premium (VRP). This metric represents the compensation options writers require to take on volatility risk.

Presently, the 1-month VRP resides at a value of 27.9%, with only 1.4% of trading days recording a larger value. This highlights how extreme the volatility profile is that is priced into options markets.


Live Chart
Evaluating the distribution of both puts and calls, which have an expiration on 6-Nov, just after US election day, we can see a near-even split between each side. Put options have a total open interest of 1348 BTC, whilst call options have an open interest of 1271 BTC.

This suggests that investors have hedged for both downside protection and upside exposure, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on the ultimate market direction.


Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
In the aftermath of the US presidential election, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, trading above $75,000 for the first time this week. This move is supported by modest capital inflows of $2.5B/month, indicating the potential for further growth amidst a consistent influx of new demand.

With an increasing demand side, alongside expanding volatility expectations across option instruments, the market appears poised for further fluctuations."

However, investors appear to have de-risked in the run-up to the US Presidential Election, highlighted by the notable outflows across the last 3 days. Nevertheless, with the formation of a new ATH, ETFs may see new demand and momentum chasers.
Live Chart
Heightened Volatility Expectations
The US Presidential Election has been a dominant focal point for investors, with expectations for heightened volatility being priced in for several weeks. Since 2023, options markets have grown to become a significant component of the Bitcoin market structure, enabling investors to express increasingly sophisticated views on the market.
The amount of open interest deployed across options contracts has surged to a value of $25.2B, with only the March ATH recording a higher value of $30.2B.
Live Chart
Options trade volume is also ticking higher, now reaching a value of $2.9B, also bested only by the volume trading into the March ATH, and during the 5-Aug yen-carry unwind. This again highlights the growing presence of institutional-grade investors, utilizing sophisticated instruments to express their market opinion.
Live Chart
Assessing the ratio between open interest allocated to put and call contracts, there is an even split between both sides. This suggests that investors and speculators have hedged and bet on large market moves in both market directions.
Live Chart
This idea that investors expect rising volatility ahead is also visible in options implied volatility (IV) priced into options.
Currently, we are seeing a surge in IV across all contract expiration dates, most notably across the short-dated 1-week expiration. This confluences that the investors are forecasting and betting on a higher volatility regime both into and after the US election results are known.
Live Chart
By comparing the difference between the options implied volatility and realized volatility over the same time period, we can calculate the volatility risk premium (VRP). This metric represents the compensation options writers require to take on volatility risk.
Presently, the 1-month VRP resides at a value of 27.9%, with only 1.4% of trading days recording a larger value. This highlights how extreme the volatility profile is that is priced into options markets.
Live Chart
Evaluating the distribution of both puts and calls, which have an expiration on 6-Nov, just after US election day, we can see a near-even split between each side. Put options have a total open interest of 1348 BTC, whilst call options have an open interest of 1271 BTC.
This suggests that investors have hedged for both downside protection and upside exposure, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on the ultimate market direction.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
In the aftermath of the US presidential election, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, trading above $75,000 for the first time this week. This move is supported by modest capital inflows of $2.5B/month, indicating the potential for further growth amidst a consistent influx of new demand.
With an increasing demand side, alongside expanding volatility expectations across option instruments, the market appears poised for further fluctuations."

A Post-Election Surge
After the U.S. presidential election results came in, with consensus pointing toward a more crypto-friendly stance under the Trump administration, a positive signal reverberated through the cryptocurrency market, propelling Bitcoin to a new all-time high. This break to ATH was echoed across all major BTC: Forex pairs.
This chart illustrates the drawdowns from ATH for Bitcoin (BTC) paired with various fiat currencies and gold (XAU). Notably, the BTC: TRY (Turkish Lira) pair was the first to hit its ATH on 26 June 2024, leading the charge before other pairs followed suit. On 06 November 2024, nearly all BTC: Forex pairs reached new ATHs, except BTC: Gold, which remains approximately 19.9% below its ATH despite Bitcoin‚Äôs current valuation at $88.6k USD.
The BTC:Gold pair remains approximately -19.9% below its ATH despite Bitcoin‚Äôs current USD valuation at $88.6k USD.
Live Chart
Historically, U.S. presidential elections have significantly impacted Bitcoin‚Äôs market performance, with notable shifts observed in both price and realized cap‚Äîrepresenting the cumulative wealth invested in the Bitcoin network.
2016 Election (Republican administration):
Realized capital surged by 20.3% leading up to the election and climbed 55.5% afterward.
Price rallied by 34.7% pre-election and soared by 124.6% in the post-election months.
2020 Election (Democrat administration):
Realized capital inflows grew by 16.5% before and by 196.3% after the election.
Price advanced by 35.4% pre-election and skyrocketed by 306.8% afterward.
2024 Election (Republican administration, thus far):
Realized capital increased by 13.3% leading up to the election but edged up slightly by 2% after.
Price appreciated by 10.1% before the election and gained 27.9% in the post-election period (to date).
The current cycle, therefore, reflects a more modest response in the run-up to prior elections, although still with a very optimistic tilt. The market is currently adjusting to the likely shifts in crypto-policy, which can be expected in the coming years.
Live Chart
Continuing the momentum from the recent ATH breakout, Bitcoin recorded its largest-ever weekly candle, with a staggering $11.6k gain. This rally vastly exceeded historical weekly moves, nearly five times the upper statistical band (1 standard deviation), signaling unprecedented bullish strength.
This exceptional price action reflects market optimism, with participants viewing the anticipated regulatory landscape as a catalyst for sustained capital inflows.
Live Chart
Spot-Driven Breakout
The chart highlights the daily Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) on Coinbase‚Äôs spot market, showing a significant uptick in buyer-side pressure. Recently, the daily spot CVD reached $143M, approaching the previous peak of $152M recorded on March 13.
Since July, every Bitcoin rally has been accompanied by a strong surge in buy-side interest on Coinbase, signalling robust spot market demand in one of the largest US exchanges. This persistent appetite from investors suggests that market participants are increasingly constructive on digital assets and reinforces the spot-driven nature of the prevailing rally.
Live Chart
Following the solid buyer-side pressure observed on Coinbase‚Äôs spot market, the recent rally saw substantial inflows into U.S. spot ETFs, with assets under management rising by $8.8 billion in the last 30 days. This growth outpaced the $6.9 billion increase in CME futures open interest, indicating a pronounced preference for spot-driven exposure via ETFs.
The correlation between ETF inflows and CME open interest highlights the dominance of cash-and-carry strategies. Yet, the more robust ETF demand underscores a shift toward direct spot exposure during this market upswing.
Live Chart
Usually, sustained demand in the spot market momentum is followed by a similar positive momentum in perpetual futures. The recent premium peak in perpetual markets‚Äîreaching $1.59M/Hour per hour (with a 7-day average of $392k/Hour) on November 12th‚Äîreflects solid speculative demand.
However, this level remains below the mid-March highs, reinforcing the hypothesis that the current rally has been more spot-driven. The tempered yet significant appetite in perpetual markets underscores that spot demand, rather than leveraged speculation, is the dominant force behind this price surge so far.
Live Chart
Discovery of Euphoria Phase
Bitcoin has entered a new price discovery phase, putting all of the circulating supply into profit. This chart shows the percentage of supply held in profit, alongside the count of consecutive days each month where this metric is more than 95%.
Historically, these euphoric phases have persisted for around 22 days before a correction occurs, pushing more than 5% of the supply below the original acquisition price. The current rally has maintained this high-profit level for 12 consecutive days, underscoring strong market sentiment but also hinting at the possibility of a correction ahead based on past patterns.
Live Chart
This chart examines cumulative realized profit during the New ATH Discovery phase, highlighting the scale of profit-taking activity. Historically, monthly profit realization ranged between $30 billion and $50 billion before demand exhaustion set in, often signalling a cooling-off period.
Currently, we‚Äôve observed $20.4 billion in realized profits since entering this latest ATH discovery phase. While profit-taking is substantial, it remains below historical peaks, suggesting additional room for further gains before reaching potential demand exhaustion.
Live Chart
Discovery Phase Bands
As we enter a new ATH discovery phase, identifying the most effective price model to navigate this heightened market activity becomes essential. This chart displays the cost basis of new investors, along with upper and lower statistical bands (¬±1 standard deviation).
During ATH discovery phases, Bitcoin‚Äôs price often approaches and tests the upper band multiple times, driven by solid demand momentum as new investors enter at higher price points. Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs price stands at $87.9k, just shy of the upper band at $94.9k. Monitoring the proximity to these bands, especially the upper and middle bands, can highlight periods of intense market demand, reflecting the eagerness of new capital to enter the market during rally phases.
Currently, with Bitcoin‚Äôs spot price at $87.9k, it is shy of the upper band at $94.9k. Monitoring the proximity to these bands, especially the upper and middle bands, can highlight when periods of intense demand are slowing down, and where price is high enough for many existing holders to ramp up their sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
Realized profit volumes are currently averaging around $1.56B/day, with long-term holders contributing $720M, accounting for 46% of the total.
Despite this uptick in profit-taking activity, the aggregated realized profit volume is around half of what was recorded during the previous cyclical ATHs (which breached $3B/day, with more than 50% attributed to long-term holders). This again suggests that there may be further room for upside if demand continues to flow in and that more sell-side pressure is required before typical peak levels of profit realization are reached.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
This newsletter examined Bitcoin‚Äôs recent all-time high, primarily driven by solid spot market demand, mainly through U.S. spot ETFs. Institutional interest has surged post-election, with notable inflows into CME futures and ETFs, favouring spot exposure and fueling Bitcoin‚Äôs entry into a new ATH discovery phase. Over 95% of the circulating supply is now in profit, typically followed by significant profit-taking.
Almost all of the circulating BTC supply is now held in profit, although this is balanced by a significant uptick in profit-taking activity. While realized profits by both short- and long-term holders have increased, they remain below previous ATH peaks, which may indicate many investors are willing to wait for higher prices."
2024,47,2024-W47,2024-11-18,2024-11-24,Bullish,90520.30,98028.18,95802.77,8.29,Agree,"Executive Summary
Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to $93k has been fuelled by robust capital inflows from both ETFs, and spot markets. Over $62.9B has entered the market over the last 30 days, with BTC dominating the demand inflows.
Elevated unrealized profits among long-term holders have triggered significant spending activity, with 128k BTC sold between 8-October and 13-November.
U.S. Spot ETFs played a pivotal role, absorbing around 90% of the selling pressure from long-term holders over the analyzed period. This highlights the growing importance of the ETFs in maintaining liquidity, and stabilizing the market.

Capital Inflows Surge
Since the start of November, the Bitcoin price performance has been nothing short of remarkable, repeatedly forming new ATHs throughout the month. When comparing the price performance of the current cycle to the 2015-2018 üîµ and 2018-2022 üü¢¬†cycles, a striking persistent similarity can be seen. Both the magnitude of the rally, and the duration are surprisingly consistent, despite vastly differing market conditions.
This longstanding consistency over cycles remains intriguing, offering insights into Bitcoin‚Äôs macro price behaviour and cyclical market structure.
Historically, bull markets in the past have extended for between 4 and 11 months from the current point, providing a historical framework for assessing cycle duration and momentum.
Live Chart
A new ATH has been set this week at $93.2k, putting Bitcoin‚Äôs quarterly performance at an impressive +61.3%. This is an order of magnitude higher than the comparative performance of both Gold and Silver, which have seen more modest quarterly rises of +5.3% and +8.0%
,
respectively.
This stark contrast suggests a potential rotation of capital from traditional commodity store of value assets, towards Bitcoin being a younger, emergent and digital one.
The Bitcoin market capitalization has also expanded to a staggering $1.796T, making it the 7th largest asset globally. This move positions Bitcoin above two symbolically significant global assets: silver, valued at $1.763 trillion, and Saudi Aramco, at $1.791 trillion.
As of current, Bitcoin trails Amazon by only 20%, placing this as the next important milestone in its journey up the ranks of the world‚Äôs most valuable assets.
Live Chart
Following Bitcoin‚Äôs standout 90-day performance, the broader digital asset market is starting to experience a meaningful influx of capital. Over the past 30 days, aggregate inflows have reached a massive $62.9 billion, with Bitcoin and Ethereum networks absorbing $53.3 billion, while stablecoin supplies have expanded by $9.6 billion.
These inflows mark the highest levels since the March 2024 peak, and reflects renewed confidence and fresh demand after the U.S. presidential election.
Live Chart
Expanding on the capital inflows observed, the vast majority of the $9.7 billion in stablecoins minted over the past 30 days were deployed directly to centralized exchanges. This inflow closely matches the total capital flows for stablecoin assets during the same period, emphasizing their pivotal role in stimulating market activity.
The surge in stablecoin balances on exchanges reflects strong speculative demand as investors position to capitalize on trends, further reinforcing the bullish narrative and post-election momentum.
Live Chart
Investigating the Profitability of Investors
We have thus far explored the tides of rising market liquidity, which has supported outperformance for Bitcoin. In this next section, we will evaluate how this price action has affected the unrealized profitability (paper gains) of market investors, utilizing the MVRV Ratio.
When comparing the current value of the MVRV Ratio üü†¬†against its yearly moving average üîµ, we can see an acceleration in investor profitability. This phenomena has typically been a supportive environment for continued market momentum, but also creates conditions where investors become more likely to start taking profits to realize these paper gains.
Live Chart
As the profitability of market investors increases, the elevated potential for new sell-side pressure comes into play. By overlaying the MVRV Ratio with ¬±1 standard deviation bands, we can construct a framework to assess over and under-heated market conditions.
Overheated (warm colors): MVRV trades above +1SD
Underheated (cool colors): MVRV trades below -1SD
Bitcoin's price has recently broken above the +1œÉ band, located at $89.5k. This signals that investors are now holding statistically significant unrealized profits, and suggests an increased likelihood of profit-taking activities.
Nevertheless, the market has historically remained in this overheated state for extended periods of time, especially when supported by sufficiently large capital inflows to absorb sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holders Spending at Extremes
During the euphoric phase of the market cycle, the behaviour of long-term investors becomes critical to monitor. LTHs control a substantial proportion of the supply, and their spending dynamics can greatly impact the market stability, eventually working to form both local, and global tops.
We can evaluate the paper gains held by LTHs by utilizing the NUPL metric, which currently resides at 0.72, just below the Belief üü¢ to Euphoria üîµ threshold at 0.75. Despite the substantial price increase, sentiment among these investors remains measured compared to previous cycle tops, suggesting there may be further room for growth.
Live Chart
As Bitcoin broke above $75.6k, 100% of the 14M BTC held by long-term holders moved into profit, enticing an acceleration in spending. This has led to a non-trivial balance decline of +200k BTC since the ATH break-out.
This is a classic and repeating pattern, where long-term holders begin taking profits whenever price action is strong, and demand is sufficient to absorb it. With a significant amount of Bitcoin still under LTH ownership, it is likely that many LTHs are waiting for higher prices before releasing more coins back into liquid circulation.
Live Chart
We can employ the Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator to evaluate the intensity of LTH sell-side pressure. This tool assesses the percent of days out of the last two weeks where the cohorts spending exceeds their accumulation, resulting in a net decline in their holdings.
Since early September, as Bitcoin's price gained momentum, long-term holder spending can be seen to steadily increase. With the recent surge to $93k, this indicator reached a value indicating 11 of the last 15 days have seen a LTH balance decline.
This highlights an increase in long-term holder distribution pressure, although it is not yet at the magnitude observed around the March 2021, and March 2024 peaks.
Live Chart
Having identified the elevated spending behaviour by long-term holders, we can consult the next tool for deeper insights into their activity around pivotal market points. The interplay of profit taking, and unrealized profit can help to highlight their role in shaping cycle transitions.
This chart visualizes:
LTH Realized Price
(üîµ): The average acquisition price for long-term holders.
Profit/Loss Pricing Bands
(üîµ): Bands representing extreme profit (+150%, +350%) and loss (-25%) levels, which often trigger notable spending activity.
Profit-Taking (üü©)
: Phases where long-term holders hold over +350% profits and ramp up spending.
Capitulation (üü•)
: Periods of high spending by long-term holders in a -25%+ loss state.
Bitcoin‚Äôs price has surged past the +350% profit-band (located at $87k), prompting significant profit-taking behaviour amongst this cohort. Distribution pressure is likely to increase as the market rallies, and these unrealized gains expand accordingly. That said, this has historically signalled the start of the most extreme phase of prior bull markets, with unrealized profits growing to over 800% in the 2021 cycle.
Live Chart
Institutional Buyers
We will now turn our attention to the role that institutional buyers have on the market, particularly via the U.S. Spot ETFs. The ETFs have been a major source of demand in recent weeks, absorbing a majority of the sell-side by LTHs. This dynamic also highlights the growing influence of institutional demand in shaping modern Bitcoin market structure.
As outlined in
Week on-Chain 46,
since mid-October, weekly ETF inflows have surged to between $1B to $2B per week. This represents a significant uptick in institutional demand, and are some of the most significant periods of inflows to date.
Live Chart
To visualize the counter balancing forces of LTH sell pressure, and ETF demand, we can analyze the 30-day change in the Bitcoin balance of each cohort.
The chart below shows that during the period from 8-October to 13-November, the ETFs absorbed around 128k BTC, which is approximately 93% of the 137k BTC in net selling pressure exerted by LTHs. This highlights the critical role that the ETFs have in stabilizing the market during periods of elevated selling activity.
However, since 13-November, LTH sell-side pressure has begun to outpace ETF net inflows, echoing a pattern observed in late February 2024, where the imbalance between supply and demand led to increased market volatility, and consolidation.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
Bitcoin's rally to $93k has been supported by strong capital inflows, with around $62.9B worth of capital flowing into the digital asset space over the last 30-days. This demand has been led by institutional investors via the U.S. Spot ETFs, perhaps even as capital rotates out of gold and silver.
The ETFs have played a key role, absorbing over 90% of sell-side pressure by Long-Term Holders. However, as unrealized profits reach more extreme levels, we can expect more LTH spending, which in the immediate term has outpaced ETF inflows."
2024,48,2024-W48,2024-11-25,2024-12-01,Bearish,93000.01,97263.18,95395.06,4.58,Disagree,"Executive Summary:
As the Bitcoin price rallied towards $100k, Long-Term Holders commenced distributing over 507k BTC, which remains less than the 934k BTC sell-side during the March rally but is significant nonetheless.
Long-term holders are locking in sizeable profit volumes, setting a new ATH of $2.02B in daily realized profit.
When assessing the composition of which entities are spending, the majority of this sell-side pressure appears to originate from coins aged between 6 months and 1 year.

Intense Long-Term Holder Distribution
Following a flurry of consistent new ATHs, the Bitcoin price is now within striking distance of the impressive and long-awaited value of $100k per coin. Like all previous cycles, the Long-Term Holder cohort is taking advantage of inflowing liquidity and a strengthened demand side to recommence distribution of held supply at scale.
Since the peak in LTH supply set in September, this cohort has now distributed a non-trivial 507k BTC. This is a sizeable volume; however, it is smaller in scale relative to the 934k BTC spent during the rally into the March 2024 ATH.
Live Chart
We see a similar story by assessing the percentage of aggregate Long-Term Holder supply transacted from a profitable position. Currently, an average of 0.27% of the LTH supply is being distributed daily, with only 177 out of all trading days recording a heavier distribution rate.
Interestingly, we can observe that this relative rate of LTH spending is larger than the March 2024 ATH, underscoring a more aggressive distribution campaign.
Live Chart
We can also consult the LTH Liveliness metric to evaluate the balance between Coinday creation (holding time) and Coinday Destruction (spent holding time). Typically, Liveliness uptrends are characterized by an environment of heightened spending activity, whereas downtrends denote that HODLing is the primary dynamic.
While the current rate of supply distribution is greater than the March peak, the volume of Coinday destruction remains lower. This highlights that most LTH coins transacting are likely to have been acquired relatively recently (e.g., more likely to be 6 months old than 5 years old on average).
Live Chart
Profits Locked In
Long-Term Holders have a key role in the price discovery process, as they are a dominant source of previously dormant supply returning into liquid circulation. It becomes more prudent to assess the degree of profit-taking amongst this cohort as the bull market progresses, as they tend to become increasingly more active as prices rise.
Long-Term Holders are currently realizing a massive $2.02B in realized profit per day, setting a new ATH and eclipsing the previous one set in March. A robust demand side is required to fully absorb this supply overhang, which may require a period of re-accumulation to fully digest.
Live Chart
Assessing the balance between profit and loss volumes taken by LTHs, we can see that the ratio of the two has accelerated rapidly in November. By definition, this results from the lack of LTH supply held in loss during this price discovery regime.
Historically speaking, the price has remained within a euphoric state for several months, assuming there is a substantial and consistent inflow of fresh demand.
Live Chart
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio assesses the total volume of both realized profit and loss locked in by investors relative to the asset size (measured via the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a significant profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
The Sell-Side Risk ratio is approaching the high-value band, inferring that significant profit-taking is occurring within the current range. Nevertheless, the current reading remains substantially lower than the terminal value reached in prior cycles. This suggests that previous bull markets have seen sufficient demand to absorb supply, even under similar relative distribution pressures.
Live Chart
The Composition of Spending
Having established a significant uptick in Long-Term Holder profit-taking, we can increase the granularity of this assessment by scrutinizing the composition of the supply sold.
We can utilize our age breakdowns of the realized profit metric to evaluate which sub-cohorts are contributing the most to sell-side pressure. Here, we calculate the cumulative profit-taking volume by age since the start of the Nov-2024.
6m-1y Realized Profit: $12.6B
1y-2y Realized Profit: $7.2B
2y-3y Realized Profit: $4.8B
3y-5y Realized Profit: $6.3B
5y+ Realized Profit: $4.8B
Coins aged between 6 months and 1 year dominate the prevailing sell-side pressure, accounting for 35.3% of the total.
The dominance of coins aged 6m-1y highlights that the majority of spending has originated from coins acquired relatively recently, highlighting that more tenured investors are remaining measured and potentially waiting patiently for higher prices. One could argue that these selling volumes may describe swing trade style investors, who accumulated after the ETFs launch and planned to ride only the next market wave higher.
Live Chart
Following this, we can apply the same methodology to the magnitude of profit realized across all investors, segregated by percentage ROI locked in.
0%-20% Realized Profit: $10.1B
20%-40% Realized Profit: $10.7B
40%-60% Realized Profit: $7.3B
60%-100% Realized Profit: $7.2B
100%-300% Realized Profit: $13.1B
300%+ Realized Profit: $10.7B
Interestingly, these groups have a degree of uniformity, with all cohorts realizing a similar proportion of the total. It could be argued that this represents a ‚Äòchips-off-the-table‚Äô strategy, where investors with a lower cost basis achieve similar USD profit volumes by selling fewer coins over time.
Live Chart
Looking specifically at coins acquired during 2021, 2022, and 2023, we can observe both considerable and sustained spending behaviour in the March peak.
However, for the prevailing rally, spending predominantly consisted of coins acquired in 2023, with coins from 2021 and 2022 only starting to increase their sell-side pressure. This again aligns with a possible interpretation of ‚Äòswing-trade‚Äô style profit-taking as a dominant strategy.
Live Chart
Gauging Sustainability
To gauge the sustainability of this uptrend, we can compare the structure of the current URPD to that experienced during the March 2024 ATH.
In March 2024, after several months of appreciation following the ETF launch, supply changed hands at several supply clusters between $40k and $73k ATH. Over the seven months of choppy price action that followed, this region became one of history's most significant supply clusters.
As supply was re-accumulated, it formed the eventual support from which this rally began.
Live Chart
Fast forwarding to today, the market rallied so quickly that very few coins changed hands between $76k and $88k. Two key observations can be ascertained from this:
Price discovery is a process that tends to require rallies, corrections, and consolidations to confirm new price ranges.
There is a sort of ‚Äòair gap‚Äô below $88k, which may become a zone of interest if the market corrects lower before re-attempting a move above $100k.
As the market attempts to re-find equilibrium in this price discovery regime, changes in the supply distribution can provide insight into supply and demand zones of interest.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Supported by surging price action, Long-Term Holders are meaningfully distributing coins, locking in a substantial $2.02B in profit. This has created an overhang of supply that must be absorbed to accommodate sustained increases in price.
When evaluating the composition of which entities are spending, the majority of this sell-side pressure appears to originate from coins aged between 6 months and 1 year. This underscores the potential for further distribution from older entities who require a higher price to part with their coins."
2024,49,2024-W49,2024-12-02,2024-12-08,Bearish,95862.89,101174.99,98367.65,5.54,Disagree,"Executive Summary
Bitcoin reached a new ATH of $99.4k after a prolonged period of trading within the range of $54k to $74k.
Several risk metrics we monitor have entered the Very High Risk üü• zone, reflecting a state of elevated unrealized profits and an increased susceptibility of investor sentiment to corrections.
The Realized Profit/Loss Ratio now shows intense profit-taking is underway, hinting at a potential period of near-term demand exhaustion.
With that said, realized profit volumes have declined by 76% from the ATH peak, and perpetual futures funding rates are also easing off, indicating the market is rapidly cooling off.
Early supply redistribution patterns suggest key demand clusters are between $87k and $98k, with very little supply having changed hands during the rally from $74k to $87k.

The Week On-chain Dashboard.
Uncoiling To A Higher Range
After the market reached its first major peak in early March, Bitcoin traded between $54k to $74k for approximately eight months through to early November. Prolonged sideways price action within a narrow range allows a large proportion of the circulating supply to redistribute and concentrate at a relatively higher cost basis.
This concentration of supply can heighten the potential for investor panic when downside volatility returns. To track these dynamics, we introduce the
Realized Supply Density
metric, a tool that quantifies the supply concentration around the current spot price within a ¬±15% price move.
A high supply concentration suggests price fluctuations can significantly impact investor profitability, which in turn can amplify market volatility.
Revisiting the last five years of significant market moves reveals a common pattern:
Periods of indecisiveness often see over
20% of the supply
concentrated within ¬±15% of the mid-range price.
This is usually followed by a sharp and volatile price move in either direction, which pushes this supply into a profit or loss.
Such volatility typically drives the Realized Supply Density metric below
10%
, signalling that a large volume of coins now holds a meaningfully different unrealized profit or loss.
The recent breakout above $74k has triggered one of these cycles of redistribution, driving the Bitcoin price to a new ATH and pushing the realized supply density metric (¬±15%) to below 10%, in this case rewarding many investors with a healthy unrealized profit.
Live Chart
Mapping Post-ATH Range Bands
In order to explore the dynamics of supply changing hands during price discovery, we can leverage a new concept called the Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). This metric tracks the concentration of supply at various price points via a heatmap. The Bitcoin CBD provides insights into how the supply is re-distributed over time across various price levels, helping to identify key zones of demand and investor interest.
As we enter the early stages of price discovery, the upper and lower range bands have not yet been fully formed. The most significant supply cluster is developing between $87k and $98k, with very little changing hands on the rally up to $87k.
This suggests that the current trading range is still finding equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but the risk remains that the ‚Äòair-pocket‚Äô below may offer little support if tested.
Live Dashboard
Assessing Elevated Market Risks
In this next section, we will consult a set of metrics designed to categorize different risk thresholds using on-chain data.
1-Gauging Supply Profitability
The Percent of Supply in Profit (PSIP) metric helps us characterize market cycles, utilizing the proportion of supply holding an unrealized profit. This provides insights into the potential risk of selling pressure, as investors with unrealized profits tend to be incentivized to lock in their gains.
üí° The PSIP metric is categorized into four risk levels:
‚Ä¢ üü•
Very High Risk:
PSIP > 90%, more than one standard deviation above its historical mean.
‚Ä¢ üüß
High Risk:
75% < PSIP < 90%, slightly above its historical mean.
‚Ä¢ üü®
Low Risk:
58% < PSIP < 75%, below its mean but above the lower band.
‚Ä¢ üü©
Very Low Risk:
PSIP < 58%, more than one standard deviation below its historical mean.
Periods where PSIP trades above the upper band typically align with the euphoric phase of bull markets. The recent price breakout has pushed the PSIP metric into this Euphoric Phase, which counter-intuitively marks a Very High Risk üü• zone. Historically, such levels are associated with heightened vulnerability to downside corrections, as investors are incentivized to realize profits, creating overhead supply.
This signals caution for market participants as the probability of increased selling pressure is rising accordingly.
Live Chart
2-Sizing Fear and Greed
The
Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)
metric quantifies the total profit or loss held by the market as a percentage of the market cap. This provides insights into the psychological state of the market, considering the magnitude of unrealized profit or loss.
Building upon the Percent of Supply in Profit metric above, NUPL offers a deeper understanding of the magnitude of profitability, which drives the emotional sentiment of investors‚Äîranging from optimism to euphoria and fear.
üí° NUPL is categorized into four risk levels:
‚Ä¢
Very High Risk
üü•: NUPL exceeds 0.59, surpassing one standard deviation above the 4-year average. This phase, marked by extreme unrealized profit, reflects market euphoria and heightened correction risks.
‚Ä¢
High Risk
üüß: NUPL lies between 0.35 and 0.59, indicating the market is in profit but not yet at euphoric levels.
‚Ä¢
Low Risk
üü®: NUPL ranges between 0.12 and 0.35, suggesting moderate profitability, typically observed in stable or early recovery phases.
‚Ä¢
Very Low Risk
üü©: NUPL drops below 0.12, coinciding with market capitulation and Bottom Discovery phases in bear markets.
As the price broke above $88k, NUPL also entered the Very High Risk üü• zone, signalling the market is now holding an extreme magnitude of unrealized profit. This elevated level suggests there is a greater risk of investors starting to ramp up their sell-side pressure, capitalizing on higher prices and the strength of new demand.
Live Chart
3-Gauging Investor Spending Patterns
Given the elevated levels of unrealized profit in the system, we can now turn to the Realized Profit and Loss Ratio (RPLR) to gauge how investors adjusted their spending patterns as Bitcoin approached the $100k level.
RPLR tracks the ratio of profit-taking to loss-taking events occurring on-chain. It, therefore, offers insights into the behavioural shifts of investors. Daily noise can be filtered by applying a 14-day moving average (14D-MA), providing a clearer view of macro trends.
üí° The RPLR framework categorizes market risk into four tiers:
‚Ä¢
Very High Risk üü•
: RPLR exceeds 9, signaling over 90% of coins moving on-chain are being spent in profit‚Äîa common sign of demand exhaustion.
‚Ä¢
High Risk üüß
: RPLR ranges between 3 and 9, where 75%-90% of coins are spent in profit, often seen around market peaks.
‚Ä¢
Low Risk üü®
: RPLR drops below 3, indicating a transition phase with a balance of profit and loss spending (1 < RPLR < 3).
‚Ä¢
Very Low Risk üü©
: RPLR falls below 1, dominated by coins moving at a loss, typically observed during market capitulations.
The RPLR metric has similarly entered the Very High Risk zone üü•, highlighting that the intensity of profit-taking activity throughout this price discovery rally is significant and likely to create overhead supply for the market to work through.
Live Chart
Cooling Down
While all three of these metrics are in the very high-risk zone, it is important to note that these conditions are typical of explosive rallies during price discovery.
We can now support this assessment by looking at the rate at which these metrics have cooled down over the last week. In particular, we will focus on realized profit and futures funding rates as key measures of sell-side pressure and excessive leveraged demand, respectively.
Realized Profit, which tracks the USD gains from moved coins, peaked at $10.5B daily on the run-up towards $100k. It has since declined to around $2.5B per day, representing a 76% drop. This sharp reduction hints towards a marked cool down, suggesting the profit-taking may have been more impulsive than sustained.
Live Chart
The perpetual futures markets also provide a similar insight, with funding rates starting to plateau as speculative demand starts to stabilize.
Funding Rates measure the interest cost of holding an open perpetual futures contracts, where, in this case, long traders must pay those on the short side. Funding costs spiked during the rally, but not to the same magnitude as in March this year.
If funding rates start to decline, that would signal that excessive long leverage is starting to ease out of the market, while a re-acceleration could signal additional risk is being added to the long side.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally to a new all-time high of $99.4k marked a pivotal moment in this cycle, moving the market well into price discovery. The breakout from the long-standing $54k to $74k price range has pushed a significant volume of supply into an unrealized profit and also triggered several high indicators we use to track near-term risks of overheating.
At the same time, several indicators are starting to cool off, such as a rapid decline in realized profit volumes and a moderation in perpetual futures funding rates. This suggests there is a net slowdown in excessive speculative interest, as well as a net reduction in spot sell-side activity. The Bitcoin market is attempting to re-find equilibrium, with the $88k level at the base of the current supply density cluster."

This week's newsletter examines Bitcoin's remarkable journey from its Genesis Block to surpassing the $100,000 mark per BTC. On December 5th, Bitcoin reached this monumental milestone for the first time, taking three days to achieve a daily candle close above $100k.
This report explores the evolution of the Bitcoin network and its economic foundations, tracing the incredible path from zero to this groundbreaking achievement.
Live Chart
Market Expansion
Bitcoin has had an actively traded price for 5,256 days and has travelled from fractions of a cent to $100k. This journey has included 72 positive monthly candles (including December 2024), with an average gain of 37.4%, and 71 negative monthly candles, averaging a decline of -14.2%.
This reflects the fascinating balance between bull and bear markets and the infamous positive skew during the most consequential periods of price appreciation.
Live Chart
As of 5 December, a total of 19,791,952 BTC have been mined, representing 94.2% of the ultimate 21 million supply cap. The Bitcoin market capitalization also briefly traded above $2.0 trillion and has convincingly flipped the reported market cap of the precious metal Silver (~$1.84T).
Live Chart
Throughout this period of extraordinary market expansion, investors have realized a total of $1.27 Trillion in profit and -$592 Billion in losses on-chain (based on the delta between acquisition and disposal prices). This resulted in a cumulative net capital inflow (Realized Cap) of $750 Billion and underscores the tremendous value which has flowed into the Bitcoin network over its lifetime.
Live Chart
Supply Distribution
Out of the total mined Bitcoin supply, the distribution amongst different wallet size cohorts is as follows:
<0.001 BTC:
5,491 BTC (0.027%)
0.001‚Äì0.01 BTC:

Of note is that a majority of these large-sized wallets (holding 1k+ BTC) are associated with exchanges, ETFs, and large institutional entities like MicroStrategy. Each of these large entities represents a collective ownership by thousands to millions of customers and shareholders.
Live Chart
On December 05, notable aggregate balances included 1.8M BTC (9.1% of supply) held on exchanges and 1.1M BTC (5.6% of supply) managed by US-based ETFs, showcasing a significant growth rate since their launch on January 11, 2024. Additionally, miners (excluding Patoshi) retained a balance of 700k BTC (3.5% of supply), while the US Government Treasury held 187k BTC (0.9% of supply), reflecting the broad distribution of ownership across various entities.
These balances also underscore the increasing institutionalization and centralization of Bitcoin custody, balancing individual ownership with larger aggregated holdings that drive liquidity and market stability.
Live Chart
Network Evolution
Next, we will focus on the evolution of the Bitcoin network, tracing Bitcoin‚Äôs journey as a system for transferring financial value since its inception. We will explore the milestones, technological advancements, and adoption trends that have transformed Bitcoin from an experiment into a global financial phenomenon, paving the way to its $100k price milestone.
Since the Genesis Block, a total of 873,304 blocks have been mined, with an average block time of 11.8 minutes for Bitcoin to reach the historic price of $100k on December 5, 2024. Whilst the contemporary average block interval is faster at around 9.6 minutes due to hashrate increases, the early years saw a slow start, as Satoshi overestimated the power of a laptop CPU relative to the initial difficulty setting.
Live Chart
Over the same period, the network difficulty‚Äîmeasured in units that represent the computational effort required to mine a block‚Äîhas increased dramatically. After 418 difficulty adjustments, excluding the periods without adjustment, network difficulty has increased to 446,331,432,498,125,300,000,000, as the security and computational power behind Bitcoin continue to grow.
Live Chart
The difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus targets a condition where blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes, regardless of changes in network hashrate. It dynamically adjusts the mining difficulty every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) to align with the target block time of 600 seconds.
Network hashrate has surged from 128,185 hashes/sec to over 804,407,834,059,443,100,000 hashes/sec by the time Bitcoin reached $100k. Cumulatively, miners have computed approximately 5.01 x 10
28
hashes to date. Remarkably, 37% of the total computed hash has occurred throughout 2024.
Live Chart
Through 5 December, miners have earned a cumulative $71.49 Billion for their computational efforts, with block rewards valued on the day the block was mined. This revenue comprises $67.31 billion in block subsidy via the minting of new coins and $4.18 billion in transaction fees paid by users. This represents just 3.57% of Bitcoin's $2 Trillion market cap peak, arguably reflecting a tremendous return on the input security budget.
Live Chart
Bitcoin has also experienced extraordinary transactional growth. To date, the network has successfully processed 1.12 Billion transactions (on an unfiltered basis).
Glassnode‚Äôs entity adjustment heuristics consolidate activity across addresses deemed to be controlled by the same entity (e.g. ETFs or exchanges). This filters out internal transfers and provides a clearer picture of the actual economic activity occurring onchain.
Using our entity-adjusted variant of the total transaction count, we can filter out approximately 280M transactions as internal, leaving a total of 840M real economic transactions to date.
Live Chart
Measuring the dollar value of these transactions at the time of confirmation, the Bitcoin network has cumulatively processed $131.25 Trillion in volume. After applying entity adjustment, the filtered transfer volume stands at $11.63 trillion, just 8.86% of the total.
This reflects how a majority of the transaction counts are economical in nature. However, a super-majority of the volume transferred on-chain can be associated with large exchange and custodian wallet management.
Live Chart
Conclusion and Summary
Bitcoin's journey to $100k per BTC is symbolic not only of a price milestone but also as a testament to its remarkable journey from a small corner of the internet to a piece of globally important financial infrastructure. Since the Genesis Block, the network has matured by leaps and bounds, reaching a market cap of $2 Trillion, flipping silver in size, and settling $131 Trillion in volume via 1.12 Billion transactions.
The network has paid miners a cumulative $71.49 Billion in value, representing just a little over 3% of its market valuation in input costs to support itself, reflecting an incredible return on input costs. With hashrate near all-time highs and a highly distributed holder base, Bitcoin is well positioned for its increasingly important role on the world stage."

Executive Summary:
A striking degree of similarity in the Bitcoin price trajectory can be observed across prior cycles despite vastly differing market scales, investor composition, and market structure dynamics.
With price trading above $100k for a few weeks now, Long-Term Holders are taking the opportunity to distribute supply into fresh demand. This has resulted in a new ATH in realized profit being set, breaching $2.1B.
A notable portion of these profit taking volumes are originating from coins aged 6m-12m, with coins older than this remaining relatively dormant in comparison.
The percentage of network wealth held by new investors has surged higher, highlighting a robust demand profile, but also reflects a transition in the balance of wealth away from longer-term HODLers.

Old But New
2024 has been another exceptional year for Bitcoin, with year to date returns of more than 150%, and the BTC price trading above $100k for a few weeks. When we compare price performance across cycles, we can see that the prevailing cycle is starkly similar to both the 2015-18, and 2018-21 cycles.
2015-2018: +501%
2018-2022: +1085%
2022+ Cycle: +638%
This parallel becomes even more impressive when we account for the order of magnitude larger the Market Cap is between these cycles, requiring increasingly larger capital flows to support the same degree of growth.
Live Chart
Interestingly, the severity of market drawdowns during each bull market uptrend has declined as the market grows, despite the extreme sell-side pressure which typically accompanies aggressive upward price movements.
The deepest drawdown in this cycle has been -32%, set on 5 August 2024. The majority of drawdowns have only seen the price fall -25% below the local high, masking this is one of the least volatile cycles to date. This may be a reflection of the significant demand opened up by the spot ETFs, as well as a growing interest from institutional investors.
Live Chart
Dissecting Losses
In the drawdown profile above, the declines in August 2023 and September 2024 are the two deepest drawdowns in the current up-cycle. Both of these periods can be characterized as a point of extreme market pressure, which carried significant potential to devolve into a regime of fear and accelerating losses.
We can visualize this using metrics associated with the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort, which we often consider as a proxy for new market demand. As previously explored in our study on Seller Exhaustion, the STH cohort is the primary source of realized loss during uptrends, providing us with information regarding the top-heaviness of markets.
Typically, periods of extreme market distress are characterized by a dominant portion of the coin supply falling into a position of loss (coins underwater). We can see in both of these instances (August-23 and September-24) that a super-majority of STH coins were indeed held at an unrealized loss.
Live Chart
However, when we measure the magnitude of unrealized losses (paper losses rather than the number of coins held in loss), we encounter a different picture. Whilst a super-majority of the STH supply (coin count) was underwater relative to their cost basis, they did not carry the extreme unrealized losses typically associated with deteriorating markets.
Live Chart
A similar story is apparent when we denominate Short-Term Holder losses as a percentage of their total invested wealth (divided by the STH Realized Cap). The previously mentioned periods did not lead to cascading realized losses despite the entirety of the STH supply being underwater on the position.
In the chart below, we highlight (blue) periods of time where both the percentage of Short-Term Supply held in Loss and the magnitude of losses locked have moved more than 1 standard deviation from the mean. The yen-carry-trade unwind on 5 August is the only notable point where this condition was briefly flagged throughout this bull market uptrend.
Live Chart
Ramping Up Sell-Side Pressure
In the previous section, we assessed and evaluated the impressive relative strength of the Bitcoin market, even during corrections. Next, we will switch our focus towards the demand profile, which is acting to offset sell-side pressure from existing holders, who are taking profits.
Long-Term Holders have distributed a significant volume of supply into the rally up to and through the $100k price point. Sell-side pressure from LTHs has eclipsed what was experienced in March when the market set the new ATH at the time of $73k.
The magnitude of this sell-side pressure is quite massive, but it is consistent with market dynamics typically experienced in the later phases of a Bitcoin bull cycle.
Live Chart
This has translated into a substantial volume of profits being taken by the LTH cohort, which has recently peaked at a new ATH of $2.1B/day.
If we adopt a simplified assumption that every seller is matched with a buyer, this observation provides some insight into the strength of the demand side, who, by contrast, has provided an estimated $2.1B of fresh capital into the market.
Live Chart
Compounding on the above observation, we can see the proportion of wealth held within recently moved supply has started to increase meaningfully in recent months. This occurs as coins held by Long-Term Holders are distributed to new investors, which in turn highlights a surge in new demand-side activity.
Nevertheless, the proportion of wealth held by these new investors has not yet reached the heights experienced during previous ATH cycle tops. The interpretation here is that the market may not have reached the level of euphoric fervour, and saturation by speculators seen in prior cycles.
Live Chart
Composition of Sell-Side
After demonstrating the scale of the sell-side pressure originating from Long-Term Holders, we can increase the granularity of our assessment using age-band sub-sets of this cohort.
By assessing the spent volume of coins aged older than 6 months, it appears as though the majority of sell-side pressure originates from the 6m-12m subset. These coins were more or less acquired in 2024. Notably, coins aged 3 years or more have remained relatively static in comparison, potentially requiring higher prices before the holders decide to release their coins.
Live Chart
Additionally, we can employ our age breakdowns of the realized profit metric to evaluate which sub-cohorts are contributing the most to sell-side pressure. Here, we calculate the cumulative profit-taking volume by age since the start of the Nov-2024.
6m-1y Realized Profit: $27.3B
1y-2y Realized Profit: $12.7B
2y-3y Realized Profit: $8.1B
3y-5y Realized Profit: $10.1B
5y+ Realized Profit: $12.6B
Coins aged between 6 and 12 months dominate the prevailing sell-side pressure, accounting for 38.5% of the total, providing confluence to the above observation.
Live Chart
We can additionally bolster our thesis by assessing the URPD segregated by holding age. Here, we again note a significant amount of coins aged 2yrs-5yrs old remain changeless, underscoring the notion that higher prices are required to relinquish their coins.
Looking Upwards
To close, we can now turn our attention to the AVIV Ratio which helps us assess the average unrealized profit (paper gains) held by investors that are active within the market.
We can utilize this metric to gauge whether the market is currently over/under heated relative to the profitability of its participants. Typically, Bull Markets reach their conclusion when all denominations of investors are in substantial profits, leading to enormous supply-side pressure coupled with an acute lack of new investors willing to buy at the current price.
At the moment, the AVIV Ratio has not yet reached its extreme band of +3œÉ, suggesting there may be room for the market to run before the profit held by the average investor becomes too tempting.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Supply-side forces are becoming increasingly prominent as Long-Term Holders continue to actively distribute coins on a large scale, resulting in an impressive $2.1 billion in realized profit. However, a strong demand side is also evident, largely counteracting the significant selling pressure from existing holders.
In addition, the proportion of network wealth held by new investors has risen sharply, supporting the notion of a robust demand profile. Nevertheless, this indicates a shift in wealth distribution away from mature investors, which typically occurs during the later stages of Bull Markets."

Bitcoin has entered a correction phase, trading -11% below its ATH of $108k but remaining above key support levels, retaining a constructive market structure.
Z-Score analysis suggests cyclical highs typically align with various metrics trading 1.5 to 2.0œÉ above the mean, offering a framework to help navigate bullish market phases.
Bitcoin's current price is around 10% above the Short-Term Holders' cost basis of $88.4k, underscoring a potential risk of downside if momentum stalls and price trades below this level.
Unrealized losses are concentrated among short-term holders, with 2.0‚Äì3.5M BTC held underwater, reflecting moderate stress in the market.
Relative Unrealized Losses peaked at 4.3% during Q3 2024, significantly lower than prior cycles driven by external shocks, highlighting a more spot-driven and patient market.

The Week On-chain Dashboard.
Evolving Peaks
The Realized Price reflects the average price at which all Bitcoins last moved on-chain, thus representing the market's aggregate cost basis. The MVRV Ratio is the ratio between the spot price, and the realized price, and it gauges the magnitude of unrealized profit held on average. Values above 1 signal an average unrealized profit, and trading below 1 indicate an unrealized loss.
The MVRV ratio is currently trading at 1.32, indicating the average unit of BTC is holding an unrealized profit of 32%. This structure is similar to post-ATH in mid-April 2024, suggesting an overall undertone of positive sentiment despite the market correction.
Live Chart
Over the years, Bitcoin's market has matured, which is accompanied by a cyclical decay in the peak values of MVRV near cyclical tops. This reflects an overall dampening of speculative extremes as the asset grows in size.
Each market cycle has seen progressively lower MVRV highs, signalling lower average unrealized profit multiples being reached:
2011:
8.07x
2014:
6.00x
2018:
4.81x
2021:
3.98x
2024:
2.78x (to date)
This decline describes a gradual reduction in volatility and speculative intensity as the market grows in scale and liquidity. It also suggests that, whilst Bitcoin remains cyclical, each peak becomes relatively less exaggerated, aligning with a more mature and efficient market structure.
Live Chart
To account for the diminishing peaks in MVRV over successive cycles, we can employ statistical methods to normalize its oscillating range. One such widely accepted approach in financial time series analysis is the
Z-Score
, calculated using the formula:
Z-Score = (X - Œº) / œÉ
Where:
X
is the observed value,
Œº
is the mean,
œÉ
is the standard deviation.
In calculating the Z-Score, we can either use the entire historical dataset for a cumulative view or adopt a shorter rolling window to better capture the dynamic nature of financial cycles and diminishing peaks in MVRV.
Using the entire historical data for the MVRV Z-Score transformation can lead to some distorted results, as earlier cycles with much higher peaks skew the mean and standard deviation, making them less reflective of current market conditions.
Live Chart
Therefore, in an attempt to account for these effects, we have optimized the rolling window by reducing its length and thus using more recent market history as our benchmark.
The chart below compares the cumulative Z-Score with a version calculated using a 4-year rolling window. Despite this attempt to adapt to the dynamic nature of market cycles, the results remain nearly identical, and the issue of decaying peaks in MVRV persists unresolved.
Live Chart
Moving to a 2-year rolling window for the Z-Score calculation (blue), the peak observed in the most recent cycle ATH in March 2024 aligns closely with the peak ranges of the previous two cycles.
In this instance, we have now adjusted for the diminishing MVRV peaks. However, significant market highs in Q4 2015, Q3 2019, and Q2 2023 are not flagged by the 2-year rolling window Z-Score, suggesting there may be further optimization potential.
Live Chart
Finally, we have applied a 1-year rolling window to the Z-Score calculation, resulting in a more refined and promising transformation. This approach works to identify both the mid-cycle and late-cycle peaks on a similar scale, offering a clearer representation of near-term market dynamics.
This 1yr MVRV Z-score reveals that cyclical bulls consistently reach local and global peaks 2œÉ range, where investor profitability has increased significantly over a relatively short period of time. During bear market phases, local and global lows are captured when MVRV trades -1.5œÉ from the mean.
This improved MVRV Z-Score may provide a more responsive framework for identifying key market turning points throughout the cycle and helps adjust for the overall diminishing peaks near the extremes.
Live Chart
Now that we have optimized the rolling window to 1yr, we can extend this framework to back-calculate the threshold price levels which would define these near-term peaks and troughs.
Bull markets are characterized by prices trading between the 1-year mean, and peaking around 2œÉ above it. Conversely, bear markets see prices remain below the mean, with significant lows occurring near -1.5œÉ. This structured approach allows for a clearer delineation of market phases.
Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $94,398, positioned above the 1-year mean of $90.9k but below the +2œÉ threshold at $112.6k. This suggests the market remains in a bullish phase, though it has retreated slightly from recent euphoric levels, which were above the upper band at the time.
Live Chart
Assessing The Correction
With the 1-year MVRV Z-Score model showing the market cooling off from a powerful rally, we can now assess the state of investor profitability by measuring the unrealized losses held. This helps to gauge market participant incentives and identify key areas of risk to keep an eye on.
First, by analyzing the Entity-Adjusted Cost Basis Distribution of the circulating supply, it becomes clear that all unrealized losses are concentrated among short-term holders‚Äîinvestors who acquired their coins in the last 155-days, near the market peak.
Live Dashboard
Focusing on short-term holders as potential sellers under pressure, if the current market drawdown deepens, we can look for areas where unrealized losses may become severe.
The average Short-Term Holder cost basis is currently trading at $88.4k. Based on a similar statistical approach covered above, we have also displayed a high ($125.5k) and low ($68.5k) band, representing typical limits of price action during bull and bear markets.
The spot price is currently trading 9.2% above the Short-Term Holder cost basis, indicating that the market is still within the norms of a typical bull market. However, if the market fails to regain upward momentum, there is a heightened chance that falling below the STH cost basis could precipitate near-term stress, and potentially additional sell-side out should investors start to panic.
Live Chart
In order to better gauge the degree of stress experienced, we can assess the BTC supply, which is currently in a state of unrealized loss. From a historical perspective, over the last 10 years, we can observe that:
During bull markets, the number of coins underwater has typically remained below
4 million
.
Early bear market stages have been marked by
4‚Äì8 million coins held in loss
.
This week, the volatility in the market pushed between 2.0 and 3.5 million coins into loss. While significant, this range is still lower than the 4 million coins in loss during the local market low set between July and September 2024. This suggests that the current market is likely in a less distressed state than it was during the previous corrective phase.
Live Chart
Another dimension for measuring pain in the market is the Relative Unrealized Loss metric, which measures the ratio of unrealized losses (in USD) relative to the market capitalization. Reviewing recent cycles highlights parallels between the current market and the 2016‚Äì17 bull market.
Unlike the 2019‚Äì22 cycle, where external shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and the China mining ban pushed the Relative Unrealized Loss to levels exceeding 10%, the Q3 2024 consolidation phase only pushed this metric to ~4.3%.
It could be argued that the current market cycle has experienced less acute stress, likely due to shallower drawdowns, reduced volatility, and the new spot demand brought in via the ETFs, as well as institutional investors.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin has entered a correction phase and is trading 11.1% below its ATH of $108k. However, the spot price is still trading above several key support levels, suggesting the bullish market structure remains intact for now. This is compounded by the relatively light levels of distress in the market, as measured by historically small unrealized losses held by market participants.
We also showed how an optimized MVRV z-score using a 1-year rolling window provides a framework to navigate near-term bullish and bearish market phases. According to this model, we are also still within bullish territory, although the Short-Term Holder cost basis remains $88.4k is a key level to watch for maintaining constructive sentiment."

Capital flows into Bitcoin remain positive, although they have declined in magnitude since first reaching $100k. This highlights a period of declining sell-side pressure as the market approaches a near-term equilibrium.
Sell-side pressure from long-term investors has also declined, alongside volumes deposited to exchanges for sale.
Several measures of volatility are tightening up, with the market trading within a historically narrow 60-day price range, often a sign that the market is almost ready to move again.

Capital Flows Approaching Equilibrium
As the price hit the $100k level, net capital inflows into Bitcoin surged, signifying investors were locking in substantial profits. These capital inflows have since started to decline in magnitude as the market consolidates and acclimatises to the new price range.
This slowdown in profit-taking represents a net reduction in sell-side forces, thus requiring less fresh capital to maintain prices within the trading range.
The Realized Cap is currently trading at an ATH value of $832B, and is growing at a rate of $38.6B/month.
Live Chart
The Net Realized Profit/Loss metric is the first derivative of the Realized Cap, allowing us to discretely observe the magnitude of net capital flows occurring on-chain, denominated in USD.
As the market digests the profit-taking distribution pressure, the balance of realized profit and loss volumes gradually trends back towards the neutral position. This suggests that a reset of supply and demand forces is taking place, and that the majority of coins transacting at the moment are not locking in a large value delta relative to the price the coins were first acquired.
Profit taking volumes reached a peak of +$4.5B in December 2024, and have now declined to a value of +$316.7M (-93%).
Live Chart
The absolute magnitude of Realized Profit and Realized Loss (Entity-Adjusted) are another set of tools which helps us gauge the direction and sentiment of capital flowing in and out of Bitcoin.
When we sum realized profit and loss together, we can see this combined metric has experienced a sharp decline from its ATH of $4B, down to a value of $1.4B. Despite this -65% decline, the current value remains elevated from a historical standpoint, highlighting the scale of day-to-day demand absorbing this capital during bull market conditions.
Live Chart
Supply Side Slows
We have established that there is a noteworthy decline in overall sell-side pressure. We can confirm this view using metrics like Coinday Destruction, and exchange inflow volumes to further investigate these dynamics.
The first tool we can employ to better profile investor distribution pressure is the Binary CDD metric. This metric tracks the expenditure of ‚Äòholding time‚Äô across the market, tracking when holders of old supply are transacting increasingly large volumes.
We saw a sustained period of heavy coinday destruction in late 2024, and early January. Over recent weeks, this metric has started cooling off, as relatively light coinday destruction took over.
This suggests that a significant number of investors who had planned to take profits have likely done so within the current price range. Generally speaking, this indicates that the market may need to go ‚Äòsomewhere else‚Äô in order to entice and unlock the next wave of supply.
Live Chart
The Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator is another metric we can use to evaluate the duration of sustained sell-side pressure. This tool focuses specifically on long-term investors.
Aligned with the heavy profit-taking volumes from before, we can see a significant decline in the total LTH Supply as the market reached $100k in December. The rate of LTH Supply decline has since stalled out, suggesting a softening of this distribution pressure in recent weeks.
Currently, the total LTH supply is starting showing signs of growth back to the upside, suggesting that accumulation and HODLing behaviour is now larger than distribution pressure for this cohort.
Live Chart
Centralized exchanges remain the primary venue for speculation and trade, and process billions of dollars in flows on any given day. Exchange inflows have markedly declined from a peak of $6.1B to $2.8B (-54%), which underscores a considerable reduction in recent speculative activity.
Notably, LTH inflow volumes to exchanges have declined from $526.9M in December, to a current value of just $92.3M, a -83% decline in deposit volumes.
This further supports the thesis that long-term investors may have completed a large tranche of their profit-taking within this price range.
Live Chart
In order to further profile the supply and demand balance, we can compare the rate of various cohorts balance change, normalized by to the volume of BTC mined. This provides a relative measure compared to new issuance which was theoretically absorbed by each cohort.
Focusing on the Shrimp-Crab cohort (holding <10 BTC) as a proxy for retail and individual investors, we note that this cohort has absorbed around +25.6k BTC over the last month. This compares to monthly issuance of around +13.6k BTC minted by miners.
As a result, these retail and individual holders have effectively absorbed 1.9x the volume of new supply coming to market via primary production.
Live Chart
Coiling Volatility
A strong degree of confluence can be noted between both on-chain models, and the historically narrow 60-day price range, allowing investors to preempt regimes of heightened volatility.
By measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60 days, we can see the compression or market volatility over time. The chart below highlights periods which have a tighter 60 day price ranges than the current trading range. All of these instances have occurred prior to a significant burst of volatility, with the majority being in early bull markets, or prior to late stage capitulations in bear cycles.
Live Chart
Sustained sideways price action within a narrow range allows for a large proportion of the circulating supply to redistribute and concentrate at a relatively higher cost basis.
The Realized Supply Density metric quantifies the supply concentration around the current spot price within a ¬±15% price move. When supply is highly concentrated around the spot price, small movements in price can significantly affect investor profitability, which in turn can amplify market volatility.
After the Bitcoin price peaked in December, it started to consolidate, creating a dense concentration of supply with a cost basis close to the spot price. Currently, 20% of the supply resides within a ¬±15% of the spot price.
Live Chart
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio describes this phenomenon from a different perspective. This metric assesses the total volume of both realized profit and loss locked in by investors relative to the asset size (measured via the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a significant profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
There has been a significant contraction in Short-Term Holder spending activity in recent weeks, leading the Sell-side risk to decline very sharply. This often signals that all of the profit and loss taking events which investors planned for, have now been executed. It tends to signal that the market is near a local equilibrium, and is a precursor to the next wave of volatility.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
Bitcoin has experienced intense intraday whipsaws in price, surging to a new ATH of $109k before crashing and subsequently stabilizing above $100k. This heightened degree of market indecision is compounded by the challenging and uncertain macro backdrop heading into, and across the US Presidential inauguration.
In this article, we evaluated and analyzed the conditions preceding the explosive yet wavering price action. We present a framework to identify signposts for impending volatility by utilizing the confluence of diminishing on-chain volume and capital flows, alongside a tightening price range."

We explore this idea from the perspective of the drawdown profile, price performance, and changes in the Realized Cap. We also address misconceptions about exchange balances, helping to frame up how many coins are in the custody of these large entities.
Executive Summary
Cyclical Market Growth:
The rate of Bitcoin price appreciation has declined cycle by cycle, reflecting a path into market maturity. The drawdown profile of this cycle thus far closely resembles that of the 2015‚Äì2017 cycle. Prior cycles also hint at a potential acceleration phase in the bull market, which tends to occur around this time (relative to the cycle low).
Realized Cap Expansion:
The Realized Cap has grown by
2.1x
in this cycle so far, below the
5.7x
peak of the last cycle and aligns with the 2015‚Äì2018 cycle at this stage. The euphoria phase has yet to fully impact Realized Cap, indicating potential room for further market expansion.
Exchange Balances vs. ETF Wallets:
We assess that the recent drop in exchange balances to
2.7M BTC
is primarily due to supply migrating into ETF wallets, many of which are managed by custodians like Coinbase. Combined exchange and ETF balances have remained stable at around
3M BTC
, reflecting a shift in market structure rather than a supply shock.
Capital Rotation Insights:
Bull markets are characterized by long-term holders distributing coins to new investors. Recent capital rotation trends have seen the Bitcoin uptrend holding $100k, underscoring the key role that new buyers have in supporting price momentum.

Bitcoin's Cyclical Evolution
To begin our analysis, we set the stage by comparing the price performance and drawdown profile across Bitcoin‚Äôs last four market cycles. This helps to contextualize the prevailing bull run within historical trends.
The chart below showcases Bitcoin's price performance index relative to the cycle low, and the following chart looks at the drawdown profile during bull markets. Via an assessment of these two charts, a few key trends emerge:
Declining Cyclical Growth:
The rate of price appreciation (gradients) has diminished with each cycle, reflecting the ongoing market maturity and the increasing capital required to grow a multi-billion to multi-trillion dollar asset valuation.
Drawdown Size
: Drawdowns in the current cycle typically range between the 10.1% and 23.6% Fibonacci levels and closely resemble the 2015‚Äì2017 cycle.
Bull Market Phases
: Bull runs typically feature an initial slow-growth phase (early bull), which is eventually followed by a period of rapid price expansion (the euphoric bull).
The current position of the 2023-25 cycle relative to the low set in late 2022 aligns with a possible transition into the second euphoric phase. Both prior cycles have seen a marked acceleration in price performance around this time, driven by an influx of new attention and demand for the asset.
Live Chart
The current cycle mirrors trends seen in the 2015‚Äì2018 cycle, a primarily spot-driven market due to the lack of developed derivatives and stablecoin infrastructure. However, the overall performance of that cycle peaked at more than a 100x return from the low, which is arguably quite unlikely given the starting price of $15.6k this cycle.
Nevertheless, we can build on this analysis using the drawdown profile during uptrends. What stands out is how similar the pattern of pullbacks is since the low was set after FTX collapsed. Despite Bitcoin trading at a market cap which is orders of magnitude larger, the typical drawdown from the local high has rarely exceeded -25%.
This is a reflection of the impressive demand profile that has emerged for Bitcoin in recent years, in part due to the acceptance of it as a macro asset in finance and the role of spot ETFs as a source of new demand.
Live Chart
Realized Cap Growth as a Bull Market Driver
To delve deeper into the phases and drivers of bull markets, we can examine how the Realized Cap has changed since each cycle low. This tool helps visualize the rate of net capital inflow deployed into the market, offering insight into the demand forces fuelling Bitcoin's cyclical rallies.
During the 2011‚Äì2015 cycle, the Realized Cap grew by an astounding
~122x
, a product of Bitcoin‚Äôs early exponential adoption. However, as the market matured, growth ratios declined with each subsequent cycle, speaking to Bitcoin‚Äôs transition into a capital-intensive and structurally mature market.
In the current cycle, Realized Cap has grown
2.1x
so far‚Äîwell below the
5.7x
peak of the previous cycle, but again showing similarities to the 2015‚Äì2018 cycle. We can also see the clear change in the gradient as each cycle enters the euphoria phase of the bull market, where the Realized Cap inflects sharply higher (in log space).
By this metric, the market has not yet fully entered this stage of exponential Realized Cap growth, which suggests there may be room for potential expansion should demand accelerate from here. This idea is likely balanced by the considerably larger size of Bitcoin today, requiring much more capital to follow a similar path.
Live Chart
Rotation of Capital: Long-Term to Short-Term Holders
The underlying driver of the Realized Cap climbing higher is profit-taking by Long-Term investors. We introduce a framework to track the capital rotation from these long-term investors to new buyers, providing a clearer view of supply dynamics during bull markets.
In bull markets, long-term holders spend long-dormant coins to lock in profits while new buyers absorb that supply at higher prices. The sustainability of a bull market depends heavily on the aggressiveness of demand, which drives price appreciation and sustains momentum.
The chart below illustrates this capital rotation during prior market markets, with 1.2M coins changing hands since the LTH Supply ATH of 14.3M BTC in December 2023. During the recent rally above $100K, 1.1M BTC have transferred from long-term to short-term holders, representing an impressive inflow of demand to absorb this supply at prices above $90k.
Live Chart
The rate of supply distribution offers further insights into investor behaviour and can be thought of as the near-term sell-side pressure being exerted.
The chart shows the long-term to short-term holder supply ratio, revealing these distribution dynamics over time. A rising trend signals a dominance of accumulation and HODLing behaviour, as fewer old coins are spent and more migrate into Long-Term Holder status. Conversely, a decline in this metric indicates strong distribution by long-term holders at the present moment.
The monthly rate of change in this ratio highlights two primary waves of distribution that have occurred in the 2023-25 cycle, which are comparable in scale to those in early 2021 and late 2017.
In each case, the market rallied for over a month after the peak sell-side, suggesting a lessening sell-side allows breathing room for the demand to push prices higher. However, each eventually reached demand exhaustion, and the market started to transition back into a HODLing dominant phase during the subsequent bear market.
These metrics demonstrate the interplay between long-term holder activity and the role capital rotation has in sustaining bullish market momentum.
Live Chart
Addressing a Misconception on Exchange Balances
There is a widely held misconception regarding the decline in exchange balances during this cycle and the potential implications for market structure.
Bitcoin balances on centralized exchanges have fallen to 2.7M BTC, down from 3.1M BTC in July 2024. While many interpret this as a form of supply shock caused by a mass of coins being withdrawn by individual investors‚Äîpotentially creating upward price pressure‚Äîwe believe the majority of this decline stems from coins reshuffling into ETF wallets managed by custodians like Coinbase.
Live Chart
After the SEC approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024, eight of eleven spot ETFs selected Coinbase as their custodian. As demand for ETF products picked up, a significant migration of coins from exchange wallets into Coinbase‚Äôs institutional custodian wallets occurred.
Live Chart
For clarity, the labels applied by Glassnode to exchange balances consider both the exchange wallets and those of Coinbase custody within the ‚ÄòCoinbase entity‚Äô.
In order to fully account for all ETFs, we can take the assets under management of the remaining ETFs that do not use Coinbase custody (FBTC and HODL) and add them to the total balance on exchanges.
Accounting for the net AUM growth of these ETFs since their inception, the combined balance of exchanges and ETF wallets has oscillated around
3M BTC, which is the same level as exchanges alone held in January 2024.
As a result, the apparent decline in exchange balances since November is more likely to represent a shift in market structure rather than an overall reduction in available supply due to individual withdrawals.
Live Chart
Conclusion and Summary
Bitcoin‚Äôs rally reflects a maturing market with reduced overall cyclical growth, measured bull market drawdowns, and moderated Realized Cap expansion. Though lower than prior peaks, the current cycle's
2.1x
Realized Cap growth aligns with the 2015‚Äì2018 cycle, leaving room for potential euphoria-driven expansion in the longer term.
We also clarified that the widely discussed drop in exchange balances does not signal a drastic depletion when accounting for the supply migration to ETF wallets. Therefore, the notion of an imminent supply shock due to declining exchange balances is inaccurate.
Instead, capital rotation from long-term holders to new investors remains the primary driver of market cycles. Following two distribution waves, the current cycle‚Äôs wealth rotation size and rate mirror the late 2017 and early 2021 bull markets. This suggests a demand exhaustion phase may follow in the short term, potentially leading to a predominant HODLing sentiment in the market."

Bitcoin has evolved into a global asset with extremely deep liquidity that is available at all hours of the day. This creates the conditions for investors to speculate, trade, and express their macro-economic views at times when traditional markets are closed.
Bitcoin continues to prove itself as an emerging store of value asset, accruing over $850B in net capital inflows. It also serves a role as a medium of exchange asset, processing nearly $9B in economic volume per day.
Multiple metrics for new demand remain elevated, however they are substantially lower than was experienced during the heights of previous cycles.
The composition of investors in digital assets is also changing, with a notable rise in more sophisticated institutional investors within the Bitcoin space. This has led to a general decline in the magnitude of drawdowns and a compression of volatility over time.

Proving Ground
Since Bitcoin‚Äôs inception in 2009, it has grown into a global asset with extremely deep liquidity, and remains actively traded at all hours of the day. Given global events often occur outside of traditional market trading hours, this makes Bitcoin of of the few assets where investors can express a view over weekends for example.
Over the weekend, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline as market participants responded to the Trump administration's implementation of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. Given other markets were closed, Bitcoin and other digital assets saw a sharp decline and then a recovery:
BTC traded from $104k down to $93k (-10.5%) before recovering to $102k.
ETH traded from $3.4k down to $2.5k (-26.5%) before recovering to $2.8k.
SOL traded from $236 down to $184 (-22.0%) before recovering to $217.
Live Chart
Bitcoin in particular now has increasingly role on the world stage, with nation-states such as the Kingdom of Bhutan running large-scale Mining operations, El Salvador promoting the currency to legal tender, and the United States Government considering the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.
Bitcoin has now traded above the psychologically important $100k level for several weeks now, a feat many critics deemed impossible. This was achieved 7 years on from its last logarithmic milestone of $10k, achieved during the 2017 bull run.
Live Chart
Whilst Bitcoin‚Äôs acceptance is growing amongst traditional investors, it still remains a contentious and polarising topic for many, often based on questionable claims regarding a lack of intrinsic value or utility.
Nevertheless, Bitcoin has cemented its position as one of the largest assets in the world, sporting a market capitalization of $2T, and ranking as the 7th largest asset worldwide. Notably, this positions Bitcoin above Silver ($1.8T), Saudi Aramco ($1.8T) and Meta ($1.7T), making it increasingly difficult to ignore.
Data Source
As the valuation and weight of an asset reaches these large scales, its inertia rises in tandem. The knock on effect is that Bitcoin now requires significantly larger inflows of fresh capital to achieve continued growth in its market cap. To explore this idea, we can utilize the Realized Cap metric which measures the cumulative netflow of capital into a digital asset.
If we benchmark from the cycle low set in Nov 2022, when the Realised Cap was $400B, Bitcoin has since absorbed an additional capital inflow of just approximately +$450B, more than doubling the Realized Cap.
This reflects the aggregate ‚Äúvalue stored‚Äù in Bitcoin at around $850B, with each coin priced at the time it last transacted on-chain.
Live Chart
Whilst BTC is often viewed primarily as an emerging store of value asset, the Bitcoin network is also able to operate as decentralized rails for BTC as a medium of exchange. The combination of nodes and miners allow for any individual or entity to settle payments across borders, without the interaction of a third-party intermediary.
When utilizing Glassnode‚Äôs entity-adjustment heuristic to filter for only economical transactions, over the last 365 days, the Bitcoin network has processed an average of $8.7B per day, with total value transferred over the last year reaching $3.2T.
Both the Realized Cap, and the economic volumes settled by the Bitcoin network offer ewmpirical evidence that Bitcoin both has ‚Äòvalue‚Äô and ‚Äòutility‚Äô, challenging the assumption by critics that it has neither.
Live Chart
Relative Dominance
After establishing Bitcoin‚Äôs growing relevance as a macro asset, we can shift our focus internally, and analyze its dominance relative to the wider Digital Asset ecosystem.
Since the collapse of FTX in Nov 2022, Bitcoin Dominance has been in a persistent uptrend, rising from 38% to 59%. This suggests that there has been a net rotation and value accrual towards Bitcoin preferentially over others in the digital asset landscape.
This may be in part explained by the wider access that the US spot ETFs offer for institutional capital. Bitcoin also has a somewhat clearer core narrative as a scarce asset, held by many as a monetary hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies globally.
Live Chart
When we compare the Market Cap of Bitcoin and various altcoins (excluding Ethereum and Stablecoins), we can see a growing divergence in valuation is underway. Anchoring ourselves to the 2022 low once more, we can compare the growth in Market Caps.
Bitcoin Market Cap: $363B > $1.93T (5.3x)
Altcoin Market Cap: $190B > $892B (4.7x)
Live Chart
Whilst there is a divergence in size of Bitcoin and altcoin valuations, the correlation between the two remains robust. This suggests that the driver for this divergence is not the rate of growth between the two, but instead a substantial difference in capital entering Bitcoin relative to the Altcoin sector.
Whilst Bitcoin continues to garner the lions share of the capital from investors, it would be expected that Bitcoin dominance would continue to climb (with a reversal in that metric being a signal for capital rotation in the other direction).
Live Chart
Where is New Demand?
With BTC prices breaking the $100k mark, one would expect the magnitude for Bitcoin exposure to be significantly heightened. We can evaluate this by assessing the percentage of network wealth which is held by coins acquired less than 3 months ago. The chart below plots how this metric has evolved over the 12 months after breaking to a new cyclical ATH.
Whilst new demand this cycle is meaningful, the wealth held in 3month old coins is much lower than it was compared to previous cycles. This suggests that there has not been the same magnitude of new demand inflows, seeming to occur in bursts and peaks, rather than on a sustained basis.
Interestingly, all previous cycles had concluded approximately one year after the first ATH break, which highlights the atypical nature of our current cycle, which first reached a new ATH in March 2024.
Live Chart
If we isolate the transfer volume from small wallets (with less than $10k), we can see a notable decline when compared to the 2021 ATH. This comes despite the significant increase in overall volume settled this cycle, and significantly higher Bitcoin prices.
This suggests that new demand for BTC has been dominated by larger sized entities, rather than small retail sized entities.
Live Chart
We can also utilize alternative datasets such as the Google Analytics search interest over time to support our thesis. Search intensity has not reached the previous euphoria levels witnessed during the 2021 bull run, despite a multitude of tailwinds for the asset.
Bitcoin Interest Over Time
An Evolving Investor Base
Whilst the Bitcoin protocol is largely fixed in its structure and consensus code, the market response to it is an ever-evolving and dynamic process. The regulatory environment is in constant flux, and new financial instruments such as derivatives and the ETF products continue to develop around it. As the environment around Bitcoin evolves, so too does the composition of Bitcoin investors, which is most notable during this cycle.
When comparing the balance changes of smaller entities (Shrimp-Crab holding <10 BTC), we note a stark change in behavioral patterns in recent years.
During the 2013 and 2017 bull runs, we can identify periods of significant coin accumulation from these cohorts, often synonymous with ‚Äòeuphoric top buying‚Äô. This pattern appears to have broken down this cycle, with smaller entities engaging in more intense accumulation during corrections and pullbacks, and then transitioning into distribution as the market rallies to new ATHs.
This suggests the presence of a more sophisticated and educated investor base, even amongst those typically considered retail investors.
Live Chart
The introduction of the US Spot ETF Bitcoin instruments has also allowed new access for institutional investors, providing regulated exposure to Bitcoin. This has enabled the flow of latent institutional capital, with the ETFs taking in over $40B in net inflows, and breaching $120B in combined AUM in the 12-months since launch.
Live Chart
If we dive into the IBIT investor cap table (as noted by analyst
TXMC
), we can see clear signs of heightened demand from institutional investors. This provides further evidence that Bitcoin is attracting an increasingly sophisticated investor base.
Controlled Downside
One of the many advantages of onchain data is it helps us profile the behavior of investors during periods of stress, such as during pullbacks and drawdowns.
When we assess the magnitude of realized loss locked in during bull markets, our current cycle remains the most reserved. The only standout event where significant losses were taken by Bitcoin holders is the yen-carry unwind on 5-August. Outside of this, loss magnitudes have remained comparatively small, portraying a more patient, resilient, and price insensitive investor base.
This deviates meaningfully from previous cycle structures, where the 2015-2018 cycle was characterized by multiple periods of local capitulation. The 2019-2022 period was even more volatile, experiencing several deep and severe capitulation events, such as PlusToken unwind in mid-2019, The COVID-19 sell off in March 2020, and the great miner migration in mid 2021.
Live Chart
The volatility profile of Bitcoin is also in a state of change, with realized volatility trading at historically low levels for a bull market. Realized volatility on a 3-month rolling window is typically below 50% this cycle, whereas it regularly exceeded 80% to 100% in the prior two bull runs.
Live Chart
This reduced volatility profile, alongside the relatively level-headed investor base, has manifested as a much more stable price structure. The 2023-25 cycle thus far has been largely a sequence of stair-stepping price action (upwards rallies followed by periods of consolidation).
We have also seen a more controlled drawdown profile, with the current cycle experiencing the shallowest average drawdown from the local high of all cycles to date.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a global macro asset. Its constant availability for trading allows investors to express their market opinions at any time of the day, whilst its deep liquidity enables investors to execute trades at significant sizes.
Addressing the criticisms regarding Bitcoin's role as a store of value and medium of exchange, the network has attracted over $850 billion in net capital inflows, whilst processing nearly $9 billion in economic volume daily. This data largely dispels challenges about these claims.
Recent regulatory changes in the digital asset ecosystem have spurred an evolution in the composition of investors, leading to a greater presence of sophisticated institutional investors in the Bitcoin market. This more patient, resilient, and less price-sensitive investor base has contributed to a reduction in the magnitude of drawdowns and a decrease in volatility over time."

A Major Devaluation
Last week, Bitcoin investors experienced an intense whipsaw in price action. BTC prices initially fell to a low of $93k, followed by a brief recovery to $102k, and are now trading closer to $98k. The indecisive price action is largely in response to President Trump‚Äôs threat of tariffs applied to Canada, Mexico and China, providing an uncertain macro backdrop for investors. Alongside this, persistent strength in the US dollar has contributed to a marginally stressed liquidity environment.
Live Chart
Whilst the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly over recent weeks, it has not moved very far from its starting position over this period, as the prevailing regime of choppy and generally sideways movement continues.
In the previous edition of The Week On-chain, we evaluated how the composition of Bitcoin investors has evolved this cycle. Bitcoin has seen a substantial uptick in liquidity entering the asset, and larger capital flows are balancing the inertia of an increasingly large asset. Additionally, the growing presence of a more resilient and patient holders has contributed to the stability of BTC prices, even amidst a relatively unstable macro backdrop.
On the other hand, the Altcoin sector has experienced significant sell-side pressure, with many assets struggling to achieve widespread adoption or product-market fit, making for a more challenged market environment. This has culminated in a wide-scale collapse of token prices, with all altcoin sub-sectors under-performing Bitcoin in recent weeks.
Live Dashboard
To explore the downside price action across the altcoin space, we can utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which projects the correlation of token returns into a two-dimensional space. This visualization helps identify tokens that tend to behave similarly (clustered together) or differently (far apart) based on their return behaviors.
We can observe that the majority of ERC-20 tokens are densely clustered, highlighting that a wide swathe of altcoins experienced the same broad-based sell-off, with a distinct lack of idiosyncratic behavior between different sectors.
In other words, very few tokens managed to shrug off this weeks downside volatility, and they largely all moved lower together.
Live Dashboard
We can evaluate the magnitude of the drawdown by assessing the 14d change in the global altcoin market cap. Over the last fortnight, the altcoin market cap declined by $234B, with a small handful of events days recording a larger absolute drawdown.
The severity of this drawdown underscores the scale of the capitulation event and can be reasonably considered to be an event within a bear market within the altcoin sector.
This is quite interesting as Bitcoin does not appear to display the same relative weakness, suggesting a divergence is opening up between BTC and the rest of the digital asset landscape.
Live Chart
If we look at this metric in percentage terms, the altcoin drawdown is still significant, with only 41 / 1662 trading days recording a larger drawdown. However, in this relative scale, it does remain more in line with previous drawdown events experienced throughout 2024.
The present drawdown is also substantially less aggressive when compared to the sell-off in May 2021 (the Great Miner Migration) and in late 2022 when LUNA/UST and 3AC collapsed.
Live Chart
Inspecting Bitcoin Losses
Despite Bitcoin price being relatively flat over the week, the realized losses locked in by Bitcoin investors during the choppy swings in price action were one of the largest of the current bull market cycle. Investors locked in around $520M in losses as the market sold off to $93k, being one of the largest local capitulation events so far.
Therefore, we can consider this as a meaningful capitulation event within the context of a macro scale bull market uptrend. Only the losses locked in on 5-August-2023, during the yen-carry trade unwind, stand out as a larger one-day loss (seeing -$1.3B in realized loss).
Live Chart
As Bitcoin grows in size, we must also consider that absolute measures of realized loss may become misleading when we compare it to previous price ranges. When assessing these losses in a BTC denomination, which effectively normalizes for market size, the severity of the losses starts to look more ‚Äòtypical‚Äô.
This surge in losses is of a similar magnitude to previous local capitulation events throughout 2024, suggesting this may still be considered a normal event for a bull market correction/consolidation period.
Live Chart
Profiling The Losses
During a bull market regime, long-term investors are generally highly profitable. Therefore, the dominant source of realized loss originates from the Short-Term Holder cohort, which accounts for the pool of recent investors who have the highest average cost basis.
Typically, Long-Term holder losses are absent during the bull market. Loss-taking for the LTH cohort usually begins as the cycle transitions from a bull market into a bear market and accelerates as the market drawdown intensifies. This ends with a final flush out, often peaking near the macro cycle low.
Alternatively, the comparatively price-sensitive Short-Term Holders tend to realize heavy losses during drawdowns within both bull and bear markets. Short-Term Holder entity-adjusted realized losses totalled $520M this week, which is a similar magnitude to pullbacks throughout the 2024-25 cycle thus far.
Live Chart
If we increase the granularity of our profile for Short-Term Holder losses, we can see that the majority of losses were associated with investors who had only acquired their coins within the last 1-month. The age-based breakdown is as follows:
24hr Realized Loss: $68.5M
1d-1w Realized Loss: $286.3M
1w-1m Realized Loss: $479.1M
1m-3m Realized Loss: $14.5M
3m-6m Realized Loss: $112.0
This reinforces the notion where the majority of onchain volume, and realized losses tend to be linked with investors who have most recently entered the market, and are thus the most sensitive to volatility and price fluctuations.
Live Chart
Looking Forward
As prices whipsaw around, we can employ a suite of onchain-derived pricing levels to explore some potential pathways and thresholds for price on the road ahead.
To assess areas of critical support, we can utilize the MVRV Z-Score on a 1yr rolling window. This specific transformation provides a clearer representation of near-term market dynamics, with the model capturing only recent market behaviour.
üî¥ +2œÉ: $118.0k
üü° Mean: $96.3k
üîµ -1.5œÉ: $80.1k
At the moment, the price has found strong support near the Mean level. Should prices break lower, the -1œÉ may mark a key threshold for the bulls' next major line of defensive support. Conversely, the +1œÉ level may act as resistance, as investors come into a meaningful amount of unrealized paper profit and may seek to realize them into market strength.
Live Chart
Since we have identified that the majority of losses originate from the Short-Term Holder cohort, it becomes prudent to highlight their investment positioning as the market trades around this middle MVRV support range.
The average Short-Term Holder cost basis has also historically acted as a strong support level during a bull market uptrend. This pricing model currently trades at around $92.2k, and is a key region to hold for the market to avoid further downside.
We can similarly employ the ¬±1œÉ bands based on a full lookback Z-Score transformation, to assess the typical upper and lower bounds for price action.
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis +1œÉ: $131k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis -1œÉ: $71k
Right now, the spot price is trading in between the upper and lower bands, and is hovering above the STH cost basis. This suggests that the bulls are still in control, but price is nearing their first lines of defence, and almost tested the STH cost basis during the recent sell-off event.
Live Chart
The importance of defending the STH cost basis and the MVRV 1Yr Z-Score pricing regions becomes increasingly apparent when overlaying the price traces onto the URPD volume profile. A significant volume air-pocket can be seen below these levels, where very few coins changed hands in that price range.
Additionally, the -1œÉ band for the STH cost basis resides at the upper bound of this volume gap, suggesting this may be a relatively sensitive area should prices fall that far.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin price has been both wildly volatile and ultimately flat over the last few weeks. It has traded up to a high of $105k, down to a low of $93k, and yet ended the week where it started around $98k.
This unstable price action resulted in a substantial loss event totalling $520M, one of the largest of the cycle when priced in USD. However, when assessing the severity of the drawdown through a normalized measure, the sell-off remains broadly in line with other local corrections.
In contrast, the Altcoin sector has undergone a broad sell-off and failed to find firm footing. The majority of tokens have experienced a highly correlated downside sell-off, with few sectors spared from the damage.
This has led to one of the largest Altcoin devaluations on record and highlights a notable dislocation between Bitcoin and the typical rotation of capital prior market cycles have seen towards the altcoin landscape."

After Bitcoin‚Äôs second attempt to break above $105k in late January, the market has entered a contraction phase, with monthly price momentum sharply declining across major assets.
Bitcoin has held relatively steady, while Ethereum, Solana, and Memecoins have faced much deeper corrections, reflecting a shifting appetite for risk.
Solana has emerged as a market leader in capital inflows over the past two years, in contrast to Ethereum, which has comparatively struggled to attract sustained demand.
However, this week, all digital assets aside from Bitcoin have seen a dramatic decline in capital flows, with Solana, and its associated memecoin ecosystem taking a relatively large hit.
Perpetual futures open interest has declined across Bitcoin (-11.1%), Ethereum (-23.8%), Solana (-6.2%), and Memecoins Index (-52.1%), reflecting a diminished appetite for leveraged speculation.

Market Momentum Takes a Breather
The Bitcoin market attempted to rally above the ATH, and back into price discovery in late January 2025. This rally, however, could not achieve the necessary momentum, and the market has entered into a period of contraction and consolidation since then, with price momentum sharply declining across major assets.
Bitcoin: +48.4% (Nov 2024) ‚Üí -5.9% (Feb 2025)
Ethereum: +60.3% (Dec 2024) ‚Üí -16.9% (Feb 2025)
Solana: +53.2% (Nov 2024) ‚Üí -33.1% (Feb 2025)
Meme Coins Index: +90.2% (Dec 2024) ‚Üí -37.4% (Feb 2025)
Notably, Memecoins and Solana have thrived during strongly trending market conditions but also tend to correct sharply during downturns. Ethereum has remained one of the weakest performers throughout this cycle, and whilst it has outperformed Solana this week, a robust trend of out-performance has not yet been established.
Live Chart
Assessing Performance So Far
The recent slowdown comes after an extended period of strong gains across the major digital assets. Looking at the performance since early 2023, we can see clear differentiation in how each asset has navigated the cycle so far:
Bitcoin
is trading within a range approximately 3.4x higher than April 2023, providing a benchmark return profile.
Ethereum
has struggled compared to its peers, ranging between 1.3X and 2.0X relative to April 2023.
Solana's
returns since 2023 peaked at 11.8x in early January 2025, but have since dropped sharply to around 7.6x as the current correction took hold.
Memecoins Index
: Saw an explosive uptick in prices in mid-2024, largely aligned with Solana‚Äôs out-performance, and peaking 5.2X since 2023. However, recent weeks have seen this sector get hit quite severely, with total performance now being the worst out of the four assets.
This provides a view of Solana‚Äôs high-beta nature, where it has experienced both the strongest upside and also the sharpest corrections. Bitcoin‚Äôs steadier trajectory highlights its resilience as a benchmark return profile for the digital asset space. Memecoins, in particular, have seen a marked decline in investor demand of late, suggesting there has been a change in risk appetite.
Live Chart
Capital Flows Drive Markets
The strong out-performance of Solana over the last two years aligns with a persistent capital inflow from investor demand. Looking at the monthly change in the realized cap, we can see clear patterns in capital movement across various digital assets:
Solana
: Has consistently attracted higher relative capital inflows, supporting its strong price appreciation.
Ethereum
: Has seen the weakest capital net inflow out of the majors, explaining its relative underperformance.
Memecoins
: Experienced several abrupt but unsustainable surges in capital inflow, reflecting speculative bursts, but without sustained momentum.
However, in recent weeks, the momentum of capital inflows has declined for all digital assets. Notably, Ethereum and Top Memecoins have now flipped negative (capital outflows), with Ethereum facing a -0.1% net outflow from the Realized Cap and Memecoins Index seeing an even sharper -5.9% outflow.
This signals a meaningful cooling down in speculative appetite and alludes to a potential for capital rotation out of riskier assets on the road ahead.
Live Chart
Weakness In Futures Markets
As momentum starts to fade in spot markets, we can also see a decline in capital inflows within the perpetual futures market. The cooling of demand on the spot side has led to a sharp drop in perpetual open interest (OI) across all major assets, signalling a reduction in speculative activity and lower cash and carry yields.
Over the last 30 days, the rate of change in open interest highlights a widespread retreat of capital:
Bitcoin OI: -11.1%
Ethereum OI: -23.8%
Solana OI: -6.2%
Memecoins OI: -52.1%
This trend of declining open interest across the board suggests that speculators are reducing their leveraged exposure, likely in response to weaker market momentum and increasing market uncertainty. The most extreme decline is seen in Memecoins, which tend to attract more short-term leveraged bets but lose traction quickly whenever sentiment weakens.
Live Chart
Funding Rates Signal Bearish Sentiment
The weakening in open interest is further reinforced by a decline in perpetual futures funding rates. This reflects a shift toward more bearish sentiment and an unwinding of leveraged positions, particularly in riskier assets.
Bitcoin and Ethereum funding rates remain slightly positive, and their deeper liquidity profile tends to see positive funding rates except during sharp leverage wash-out events.
Solana funding rate have edged lower and have traded negative in recent weeks, signalling a cooling off of demand for long speculative positions.
Memecoins have seen funding rates turn very negative, indicating that shorts now dominate in these highly speculative assets, and many traders are closing their positions (or being liquidated).
Negative funding rates for Solana and Memecoins suggest a net shift towards bearish sentiment in higher-risk assets and a closing out of excessive long-sided leverage.
Live Chart
ETF Flows and Market Impact
With the market in a contraction phase, institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum has slowed based on spot ETF flows. By normalizing net inflows against each asset‚Äôs native spot volume, we can gauge the weight and influence of the ETFs on market dynamics.
Bitcoin ETFs saw several outflows exceeding $200M/day last week, however this was followed by a strong rebound in buy-side activity, exceeding 8% of global spot volume, and highlighting institutional demand (akin to ‚Äò
buy the dip‚Äô
behavior).
Ethereum ETF demand has cooled significantly and remains much smaller in scale compared to Bitcoin. ETF activity for ETH is hovering close to zero in terms of net flows in and out, suggesting a lack of strong traditional investor demand and participation.
This divergence has been a theme of this market cycle thus far and reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs dominant role within the institutional asset mix. Ethereum continues to struggle to attract large, sustained inflows, which further explains its relative underperformance in recent years.
Live Chart
A Key Bull-Bear Threshold
Bitcoin is currently trading $1k-$5k above the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, located at $92.5k. Historically, this level has served as a key pivot point between local scale bull and bear phases, being the pivot point where the average recent buyer moves between a state of unrealized profit and loss.
Reviewing previous instances where Bitcoin reached a new ATH and then corrected lower, we can see a similar pattern in May 2021, Nov 2021, April 2024, and Feb 2024.
In each of these cases, the downtrend extended toward the lower band of the STH cost basis model, specifically -1 standard deviation (œÉ) below the cost basis. Currently, this lower band sits at $71.6K, helping frame up the potential downside risks should these historical patterns repeat.
Live Chart
Post ATH Consolidation
In prior instances where Bitcoin has reached a new ATH, we observe a consistent post-rally pattern, where a surge in realized supply density occurs within ¬±15% of the spot price. This results from the market transitioning from an aggressive uptrend into price consolidation, as the market trades within a relatively narrow range.
This behaviour is evident in previous cycle tops, where:
As the market rallies within price discovery, the realized supply density crashes lower all the way up to the price peak.
Market participants then begin redistributing coins as the market enters a correction or consolidation phase.
This often occurs close to the STH cost basis, as the conviction and demand profile of new investors is tested.
The current realized supply density aligns with a typical post-ATH consolidation phase, where buyers and sellers try to establish a new equilibrium before the next major trend unfolds.
Live Chart
Approaching a Decisive Market Moment
To better understand how sensitive the market is due to this supply density, we can analyze the supply held by short-term holders (STH) in recent post-ATH distribution phases. This helps gauge the patterns of new investor accumulation and whether current conditions resemble past cycle peaks.
When comparing STH supply changes, we observe:
The recent accumulation phase closely mirrors May 2021, suggesting a similarly large amount of supply, and investors will be sensitive to a price decline below $92.5k.
In April 2024, new investors also accumulated aggressively, but the magnitude of the STH supply uptrend in the current cycle structurally aligns more with May 2021 rather than 2024.
Given these similarities, we are now very close to a decisive moment in the market‚Äîa phase where price action is primed for uncoiling. If demand remains strong, Bitcoin could establish a new range above ATHs. However, a lack of sustained buy pressure could lead to a deeper distribution-driven correction, similar to prior post-ATH phases. This would likely be driven by panic amongst recent buyers who see their recently acquired coins move from being in profit to holding an unrealized loss.
Live Chart
Conclusion & Summary
Bitcoin has been consolidating around $95k for several weeks and is trading within a relatively stable range. The same cannot be said for the wider digital asset landscape, with Ethereum, Solana, and Memecoins all seeing significant drawdowns from their cyclical highs. In particular, Memecoins have seen a significant cool-off of demand, as evidenced by capital outflows, sharp price declines, and bearish sentiment in futures markets.
For Bitcoin, the key level to watch is the Short-Term Holder cost basis around $92.5k. This is a pivot point where a large proportion of recent buyers will see their holdings move into an unrealized loss. This could precipitate more downside as panic sets in. In either case, the current consolidation phase appears to be nearing its later stages, and the market looks ready to trend in one direction once again."
2025,8,2025-W08,2025-02-17,2025-02-23,Bullish,95781.80,96265.98,96481.94,0.51,Agree,"Executive Summary
Bybit suffered one of the largest hacks in crypto history, losing 403,996 ETH (~$1.13B) from its cold wallets due to a smart contract exploit. This breach led to panic withdrawals, with total exchange outflows reaching approximately $4.3B across Bitcoin and stablecoins.
Market sentiment deteriorated rapidly, triggering a broad sell-off. Bitcoin monthly performance dropped to -13.6%, while Ethereum (-22.9%), Solana (-40%), and Meme Coins (-36.9%) erased months of gains, resetting market momentum to April 2024 levels.
The price drop pushed Bitcoin back into the realized supply ‚Äúair gap‚Äù between $70K and $88K, a zone with a low-cost basis density. Initially driven by long-term holder sell-offs, this weakness was exacerbated by the Bybit hack, increasing downside momentum.
With the price dropping below the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, new demand investors are under severe pressure and are beginning to realize significant losses. Historically, this has signalled a period of seller exhaustion, however, a continued lack of demand could extend the current downtrend.

A Historic Hack Shakes the Market
On February 21, 2025, the market was rattled by one of the largest exchange hacks in crypto history, as Bybit suffered a massive security breach. The attacker drained 403,996 ETH (~$1.13 billion) from the platform‚Äôs Ethereum cold wallet, exploiting smart contract permissions to reroute funds to an unidentified address.
Live Chart
Bybit CEO Ben Zhou
explained
that the attack was executed through a ""Musked UI,"" where a fraudulent interface deceived signers into approving a malicious transaction. Despite the severity of the breach, Bybit assured users that other cold wallets remained secure and withdrawals were still operational.
The hacker's transactions revealed that the stolen assets were not limited to Ethereum, with substantial losses across multiple assets:
Ethereum (ETH):
403,996 ETH hacked
Staked Ethereum (stETH):
91,076 stETH hacked
mETH:
8,000 mETH hacked
cmETH:
15,000 cmETH hacked
With nearly $1.48B in stolen funds, the hack left the market on edge, triggering concerns over exchange security, fund safety, and potential market-wide sell pressure.
Live Chart
Market Fallout and Exchange Outflows
Following the hack, the market reacted with heightened volatility and panic withdrawals, leading to a significant decline in Bybit‚Äôs reserves as users rushed to secure their assets.
By February 24, 2025, Bybit‚Äôs BTC, USDT, and USDE reserves experienced substantial outflows:
Bitcoin (BTC): 21,248 BTC net outflow (70,604 BTC ‚Üí 49,356 BTC)
Tether (USDT): $1.76B USDT net outflow (3.25B ‚Üí 1.50B USDT)
USDE: $217.47M USDE net outflow (578.37M ‚Üí 360.90M USDE)
These figures illustrate the liquidity drain across Bybit, reinforcing broader concerns over centralized exchange security.
Live Chart
Outflows Peak
By February 24, 2025, Bybit‚Äôs reserves of major assets - including Bitcoin and stablecoins - dropped from $10.8B at the time of the hack to $6.5B, highlighting a cumulative outflow of $4.3B. While the initial wave of panic-driven withdrawals was severe, the rate of outflows has since moderated, suggesting a gradual stabilization.
At the same time, Ethereum reserves - including both native ETH and staked ETH - rebounded to $1.19B, aided by Bybit‚Äôs
efforts to replenish holdings
. ETH price action remained weak, declining to $2,490, while a subsequent ~$117M outflow after the buyback suggests that investor confidence is still fragile.
Live Chart
Ethereum Reserve Recovery
By February 26, 2025, Bybit received a total Ethereum inflow of $1.58B, with $802M (50.7%) originating from just eight large transactions.
These inflows suggest a deliberate effort to
replenish
reserves, likely through intra-exchange transfers, strategic acquisitions, or external deposits from institutional liquidity providers.
Live Chart
While Bybit worked to replenish its Ethereum reserves, Bitcoin outflows from the exchange have been substantial. Since the time of the hack, Bitcoin outflows totalled $2.47 billion, with 47.2% ($1.16B) exiting via five large transactions.
Live Chart
A similar wave of outflows occurred with Tether (USDT). Over the same period, outflows reached $2.25 billion, with 38.1% ($854M) via eight large transactions.
Live Chart
By analyzing Bybit‚Äôs Ethereum replenishment efforts alongside significant Bitcoin and Tether outflows, we gain insight into how the exchange - and, by extension, larger entities - responded to one of the largest hacks in crypto history.
Market Turmoil Following the Hack
As the fallout from the Bybit hack unfolded, the market reacted with heightened volatility and a sharp downturn. With
declining liquidity across the market
and spot demand cooling down, sell pressure intensified, triggering a broader correction.
The intensified market-wide weakness led to Bitcoin price monthly momentum plunging by -13.6% while Ethereum and Solana saw even steeper declines of -22.9% and -40%, respectively. The Meme Coin Index also collapsed by -36.9%, underscoring the sharp risk-off sentiment.
This downturn has reversed months of positive price uptrend, bringing the momentum back to levels last seen in April 2024. The scale of the decline highlights broader fragility in market confidence following the recent ATH in December 2024.
Live Chart
Bitcoin Re-Enters a Low-Liquidity Zone
The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap illustrates how Bitcoin‚Äôs December 2024 ATH created an air gap in realized supply between $70K and $88K. During strong trends, price appreciation tends to outpace capital inflows, leading to lower realized supply concentration in these ranges.
As the market rallied to new highs,
long-term holders began distributing supply
, weakening price momentum. The Bybit hack further intensified this downtrend, pushing Bitcoin back into the low-liquidity air gap shown in the following chart. With price now retesting this zone, the market is seeking demand, as further downside could trigger heightened volatility and additional sell pressure.
Live Dashboard
Short-Term Holders Under Pressure
With Bitcoin plunging to $87K, now 20% below its ATH of $109K, recent investors are experiencing severe psychological stress as the price trades ~5% below their cost basis (STH-MVRV = 0.95).
Adjusting STH-MVRV, we observe that new investor profitability has declined -15.8% from its quarterly median, falling below the one standard deviation threshold (-11%). This signals significant unrealized losses, a condition historically leading to capitulation events or forced sell-offs during market downtrends.
Live Chart
Short-Term Holders Begin Realizing Losses
To further analyze new investor reactions, we turn to STH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which measures whether short-term holders are selling at a profit or loss.
STH-SOPR has dropped by -0.04 below its quarterly median, significantly under the one standard deviation threshold (-0.01).
This suggests a notable increase in loss realization, as many recent buyers are exiting positions at a loss.
Historically, deep SOPR contractions have led to at least temporary market stabilization as weaker hands exit. However, under current macroeconomic conditions, the risk remains that the price decline could extend further if no strong demand catalyst emerges.
Live Chart
Conclusion & Summary
A broad market correction following the Bybit hack pushed Bitcoin‚Äôs monthly performance down to -13.6 %, while Ethereum, Solana, and Meme Coins suffered even steeper losses, resetting market momentum to April 2024 levels.
As Bitcoin retraced into a realized supply ‚Äúair gap,‚Äù short-term holders faced mounting unrealized losses. Accordingly, STH-MVRV and STH-SOPR edged down below their statistical low bands, showing significant loss realization by new investors due to declining profit margins.
If demand fails to recover, further downside risk persists, making the coming weeks critical in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes or capitulation deepens."
2025,9,2025-W09,2025-02-24,2025-03-02,Bullish,91510.82,94265.48,87630.50,3.01,Agree,"Executive Summary:
Digital assets have experienced significant sell-side pressure in recent weeks, with Bitcoin tumbling by -28%, and Ethereum and Solana prices collapsing by more than -50% since their cycle highs.
As the market sells off, realized losses have increased massively, recording the second largest loss-taking event of the cycle, and underscoring the severity of the correction.
The major digital assets did rebound briefly following the announcement of a Strategic Crypto Reserve by President Trump. However, this turned out to be another ‚Äòsell-the-news‚Äô event, with prices continuing to fall, and trading below their pre-announcement levels.
Strong confluence between price structure and key on-chain metrics indicate that the $92k remains a critical level for Bitcoin to re-establish upwards momentum, whilst the ~$70k level appears to be a key zone for the bulls to build support if reached.

The Week On-chain Dashboard.
Violent Volatility
Liquidity in the broader economy continues to contract, as evidenced by the multi-month uptrend in the US Dollar Index (DXY). As assets which trade 24/7, digital assets' prices are often some of the first to respond to contractions in liquidity, acting as a leading signal for other markets.
Over the weekend, President Trump announced that plans for a Strategic Crypto Reserve were underway, which would include BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA and XRP. This resulted in a brief, but strong resurgence of market strength, with prices rallying sharply.
However, in the days that followed, each asset largely retraced this move, turning into a classic sell-the-news event, as prices collapsed back below their pre-announcement levels.
Bitcoin remains the most resilient of the mix, with its deeper liquidity profile and market size making large market movements harder to achieve. However, both Ethereum and Solana, the second and third most prominent digital assets, experienced quite sharp devaluations, down to over 50% from their cycle highs.
Live Chart
Volatility Releases
As demonstrated by the intense whipsaw in price action, this has led to very turbulent conditions over the last two weeks against a backdrop of an uncertain political environment.
We can see that realized volatility for Bitcoin surged across several time frames. From this perspective, the 1-week and 2-week rolling windows have recorded some of the highest volatility values of the cycle so far, exceeding 80%.
Live Chart
On-chain data allows for a degree of clarity into the acquisition patterns of market participants. The URPD metric is a great tool, offering us a lens into the cost-basis clusters of the BTC supply.
Notably, the initial collapse in prices took the market below $86k, a zone where very few coins had previously changed hands. In a way, the market is testing to see whether the bulls are willing to provide demand support in this area, especially since so many coins have been acquired at prices above $90k, and are now holding an unrealized loss.
Live Chart
Between Feb 26th to March 3rd, over 150k coins (0.76% of the circulating supply, and equivalent to $14.2B in value), were acquired within this ‚Äòair-gap‚Äô region below $86k.
Prices are beginning to trend back towards the upper bound of this zone, and it remains to be seen if investors from the large cluster above $90k are going to take this rally as an exit liquidity opportunity, and cut their losses.
Live Chart
The Realized Supply Density metric quantifies the magnitude of supply concentrated around the current spot price within a ¬±10% price move. When supply is highly concentrated around the spot price, small movements can significantly affect investor profitability, which in turn can amplify market volatility.
Under these assumptions, we can observe how the supply previously concentrated within a tight price range responds to heightened volatility. As prices declined, the realised supply density plummeted, signalling a very large shift in investor profitability had occurred.
This metric highlights the violence of the volatility experienced by the market, which may impact investor sentiment moving forward.
Live Chart
Inspecting the Damage
Despite Bitcoin holding up better relative to other major assets, the recent sell-off has still been the second largest weekly decline of this cycle. The market sold off -13.9% over the last week, bested only by the yen-carry-trade unwind event that occurred on 5-Aug-2024.
Live Chart
Despite the severity of the correction, the magnitude of the drawdown remains in line with previous drawdowns this cycle, with Bitcoin trading -28% below its ATH. This highlights the relatively robust demand picture Bitcoin has seen during the 2023-25 uptrend, which has been characterised by shallower drawdowns when compared to prior cycles.
Whilst -28% is a large drawdown in 2023-25, a typical drawdown in 2017 was over -30%, and the 2019-21 cycle saw multiple -50% declines.
Live Chart
Blood in the Streets
When the Bitcoin market sells off, valuable insights can be drawn from studying the reaction of investors. This helps us better understand behavior patterns and any shifts in aggregate sentiment.
We can see a notable uniformity in the accumulation and distribution behavior across varying wallet sizes. Over the last two months, all wallet size cohorts have engaged in heavy distribution, providing enormous sell-side pressure to the market.
The intensity of this sell-side pressure has heightened since mid-January, contributing to the recent weakness in the market.
Live in Engine Room
A significant proportion of this sell-side has originated from coins which are locking in a loss. The Realized Loss across all market participants hit $818M/day this week, with only the yen-carry-trade unwind on 5-Aug-2024 recording a larger value ($1.34B).
This showcases that the current market downturn has been a challenging environment for investors, with many exiting the market below their cost basis under the pressure of the drawdown.
Live Chart
From the perspective of the SOPR metric, which assesses the average profit/loss multiple locked in across investors, we note the first period of loss dominance since Oct 2024.
However, the structure still appears constructive if SOPR finds support at the break-even level of 1.0. Swift and short undercuts at the equilibrium level of 1.0 suggests that investors are buying and defending their cost-basis, which is a typical characteristic of bull markets.
Live Chart
In addition, the Short-Term Holder cohort, a proxy for new demand in the market, has recorded its second largest negative SOPR print of the cycle, again highlighting the exceptionally challenging market conditions for new investors to navigate.
This suggests that new investors have locked in substantial losses this week, and may be a sign of a significant inflection point in investor sentiment.
Live Chart
Maintaining Momentum
We will now turn to an assessment of both price action, and how the market is trading relative to key cost basis levels, derived using on-chain data.
Assessing the price structure over the last few months, we note three key pricing points:
The initial range breakout at $70k in November 2024.
A significant surge in price as the market crossed $80k.
Consolidation phase, with a range low of around $90k.
Live Chart
The Short-Term Holder cost basis has historically acted as an important reference level across bull-market uptrends. We have calculated the ¬±1œÉ bands of the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, which have typically acted as a sort of upper and lower bound for local price action.
At the moment, these levels are trading at:
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis +1œÉ: $130k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis: $92k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis -1œÉ: $71k
This week, the spot price has sold off below the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, and is currently trading between this level, and the lower -1œÉ band.
Live Chart
The Active Realized Price can help bolster this assessment. The Active Realized Price provides a more true-to-life estimation of the cost-basis for active investors. With 50% of trading days above and below the Active Realized Price, one can consider this level as a key threshold separating a bull and a bear market.
The Active Realized Price is trading at $70k, which is aligned with the STH-CB lower band, as well as the lower bound of the air-gap discussed in the URPD metric earlier. With significant confluence across several key cost basis metrics, this price region becomes an area of interest, perhaps being the final defence line for the bulls in the event of a complete capitulation.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The coiling of volatility over recent months has led to a widespread price contraction across all digital assets. This has precipitated significant loss taking events, and marks the second largest capitulation event of our current cycle.
For the Bitcoin market, decisive reactions around Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis at $92k appear to be a key level to monitor for local momentum. If the market deteriorates further, the $71k region is a key area of interest. It aligns with several technical, and on-chain metrics alike, making it an important level for the bulls to defend should it be reached."

Bitcoin entered a phase of strong investor distribution in early January, with the Accumulation Trend Score confirming persistent sell-side pressure.
Heightened volatility, weak demand, and liquidity constraints have prevented meaningful accumulation from restarting, reinforcing downside risks.
Panic-driven selling has intensified, with STH-SOPR spiking well below the break-even level of 1, signalling fear and loss realization among recent buyers.
A custom SOPR-adjusted CDD metric we developed shows that the intensity of the sell-off mirrors past capitulation events, notably the one in August 2024, as the market plunged to $49k.

Post-Euphoria Distribution
Bitcoin's cyclical behaviour is a product of both accumulation and distribution phases, with capital rotating between investor cohorts over time. The Accumulation Trend Score tracks these shifts, where values near 1 (dark purple) indicate substantial accumulation and near 0 (yellow) signal distribution.

The chart below shows how several accumulation cycles have been followed by distribution phases, which historically lead to weaker price action. The latest distribution phase commenced in January 2025, aligning with Bitcoin’s sharp correction from $108k to $93k.

The Accumulation Trend Score currently remains below 0.1, signalling persistent sell-side pressure is underway.


Live Chart
The Accumulation Trend Score measures the relative change in aggregate onchain balances. However, it is generally skewed by the behaviour of larger entities and does not reveal where Bitcoin was acquired. While it highlights overall accumulation or distribution trends, it lacks the granularity to pinpoint key cost-basis levels.

To gain deeper insights, we can turn to the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) Heatmap, which visualizes where supply concentration has formed across different price ranges, helping us identify areas of potential support or resistance.

Market participants actively accumulated BTC during pullbacks between mid-December and late February, particularly in the $95k–$98k price range. This buy-the-dip behaviour suggests that investors still firmly believed in the bull trend, interpreting pullbacks as temporary pauses before further upside.


Live Dashboard
From late February onwards, as liquidity conditions tightened, confidence in accumulation started to deteriorate. External risk factors, including the Bybit hack and escalating U.S. tariff tensions, amplified market uncertainty and Bitcoin’s price trading below $92k. This level is crucial as it reflected the market breaking below the Short-Term Holder cost basis.

Unlike the earlier phase, there was no significant dip-buying response this time, indicating that sentiment had shifted toward risk aversion and capital preservation rather than continued accumulation.

The CBD heatmap confirms that as macro uncertainty increased, accumulation demand weakened, reinforcing that investor confidence is a critical driver of accumulation behaviour. The lack of dip-buying at lower levels suggests that capital rotation is underway, potentially leading to a more prolonged consolidation or corrective phase before the market finds a firm support base.


Live Dashboard
Declining Demand Momentum
We have now used the CBD Heatmap and Accumulation Trend Score to highlight a lack of substantial accumulation since late February. We can diver deeper into this behaviour by analyzing the cost basis of two short-term holders (STH) sub-cohorts:

1w–1m holders – Investors who acquired BTC in the past 7 to 30 days.
1m–3m holders – Investors who acquired BTC between 1 and 3 months ago.
During periods of strong capital inflow, the cost basis of the 1w–1m cohort typically rises above that of the 1m–3m cohort. This signals that newer investors are buying BTC at a relative premium, reflecting bullish sentiment and positive momentum. However, in Q1 2025, this trend started to flatten out, marking an early sign of weakening demand in the immediate term.

With Bitcoin prices dropping below $95k, this model also confirmed a transition into net capital outflows, as the 1w–1m cost basis fell below the 1m–3m cost basis. This reversal indicates that macro uncertainty has spooked demand, reducing new inflows and arguably increasing the probability of further sell pressure and a prolonged correction.

This transition suggests that new buyers are now hesitant to absorb sell-side pressure, reinforcing the shift from post-ATH euphoria into a more cautious market environment.


Live Chart
Sizing Up Fear
With the market undergoing a post-ATH distribution phase, it becomes crucial to gauge the extent of fear amongst the Short-term Holder cohort, especially those who entered most recently. Understanding this cohort’s behaviour helps market observers identify moments of extreme seller exhaustion, which have historically presented opportunities for longer-term investors.

A key metric for this analysis is the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR), which measures whether STHs are spending in profit (SOPR > 1) or at a loss (SOPR < 1).

Since prices dropped below $95k, the 196-hour moving average of STH-SOPR has remained below 1, suggesting that most short-term investors are realizing losses. In extreme moments, STH-SOPR dropped to 0.97 as the price crashed to $78K, underscoring the severity of capitulation.

This persistent downside momentum has left new investors on edge, leading to widespread panic selling at a loss. Such conditions often precede local seller exhaustion, a dynamic that long-term investors may monitor for potential re-entry opportunities.


Live Chart
Beyond tracking loss realization, another key metric for fear-driven sell-offs is Short-Term Holder Coin Days Destroyed (STH-CDD), which measures the economic weight of new investors’ spent coins by factoring in both the volume and holding time of the coin.

During sharp market downtrends, STH-CDD spikes as investors are on the verge of becoming long-term holders panic-sell, destroying a large wave of coin days. This signals short-term holders who endured prior uncertainty capitulate, potentially adding to downward pressure.


Live Chart
Combining these two concepts, we can construct an indicator that adjusts STH-CDD by incorporating profit/loss realization intensity, using the formula:

💡
(SOPR_STH - 1) * CDD_STH
This metric refines STH-CDD by weighting it with the intensity and direction of realized profit or loss, providing a more precise signal of panic-driven sell-offs.

As shown in the chart below, the recent sell-off by top buyers has driven this indicator to -12.8K coin days per hour, reflecting intense loss realization and a moderate capitulation event. A similar pattern emerged in August 2024, when Bitcoin plunged to $49k amid market stress and macro uncertainty. The current structure suggests a comparable capitulation phase.


Live Chart
A Compass in the Bear
With sell-side pressure dominated by investors who recently acquired coins at relatively high prices, it becomes insightful to gauge how deep the current bearish phase may get. To assess this, we will use various statistical bands based on the Short-term Holders' cost basis as a read on psychological fair value extremes.

The chart below presents the statistical high and low range of price deviations derived from these cost basis models.

Currently, the lower bound of this model—where short-term holders are deeply underwater—sits between $71.3k and $91.9k. Notably, this range aligns with the previously discussed liquidity gap between $70k and $88k, suggesting that the probability of forming a temporary floor in this zone is meaningful, at least in the near term.


Live Chart
Summary & Conclusions
Bitcoin’s market structure has entered a post-ATH distribution phase, with weakness in aggregate demand and persistent sell pressure by recent top buyers. The Accumulation Trend Score has remained near 0.1 since early January, while the CBD Heatmap shows a fading buy-the-dip response from investors.

Using the cost-basis of Short-Term Holders, we can see that market momentum and capital flows have turned negative, signalling a decline in demand strength, and investor uncertainty is affecting sentiment and confidence.

A fear-driven capitulation of short-term holders is evident through STH-SOPR consistently trading below 1 and STH-CDD spiking. This local capitulation event also aligns with the market trading towards the lower statistical band, where recent investors are likely experiencing a high degree of financial stress."

Liquidity continues to contract across on-chain and spot markets, with net capital inflows grinding to a halt, and exchange inflows slowing down.
Open Interest across futures contracts has pulled back, suggesting a reduction in hedging and speculative activity. Alongside this, an unwind in the cash-and-carry trade on CME Group futures appears to be underway, providing additional headwinds for market liquidity.
Key options metrics express a preference for downside risk aversion, with the implied volatility priced into put options resulting in elevated premiums.
Short-term investors are experiencing significant pressure to lock in losses. However, the incentive to capitulate remains somewhat less severe than in previous correction events and bearish periods.
Long-Term Holder activity remains largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure. This cohort still owns a comparatively large volume of network wealth for this stage of the cycle, creating an interesting dynamic moving forward.

Contracting Liquidity
The digital asset landscape has experienced strong downside pressure over recent weeks, with the Bitcoin price falling from $97k in late February, to $82k today.
A stark contraction in liquidity appears to be underway, and supports the decline in valuations. Net capital inflows into Bitcoin are grinding to a halt, with the Realized Cap growing at a rate of only +0.67% per month.
From this, we can draw two key observations:
As of now, there is a lack of fresh capital entering the asset to support higher prices.
Volatility expectations are elevated, as the market transitions from a profit-dominated regime, back towards a more neutral equilibrium position.
Live Chart
One method to measure and quantify active capital in the market is through the ‚ÄòHot Supply‚Äô metric. This supply volume represents the wealth held within coins aged one week or less and can be considered as a proxy for coins available and ready to transact.
The current wealth held by the Hot Supply cohort has declined from 5.9% of the circulating supply, to a value of just 2.8%. This represents more than a 50% contraction in liquid circulating coins, suggesting that there has been a decline in the appetite for trade and speculation.
Live Chart
A similar trend can be seen across inflow volumes to Exchanges, the central locations for trading activity. Inflows across all exchanges have declined from +58.6k BTC/day at the market peak to the current value of +26.9k BTC/day, a decline of over -54%. This aligns with the decline in aggregate investor sentiment and market capital flows noted previously.
There is also a similarity in the magnitude of contraction between the Hot Supply, and Exchange Inflows, providing a view of weaker overall demand-side pressure.
Live Chart
Cash-and-Carry Unwind
Having assessed the on-chain landscape, we shall redirect our attention to the derivatives market, which experiences the highest trade volume of all market sectors.
Assessing the open interest in futures contracts, we can see a large decline taking place in recent months. Open interest has declined from $57B at the market ATH, down to a current value of $37B (-35%).
This highlights a net reduction in speculation and hedging activity, painting a similar dynamic to the dampened activity witnessed in various on-chain markets.
Live Chart
The introduction of US spot ETFs in 2024 provided institutional investors with the opportunity to put on regulated cash-and-carry trade positions. By pairing long-ETFs with a short-futures position via the CME Group exchange, traders can now arbitrage the oftentimes healthy price premium which exists between spot and futures markets.
Strong evidence for the cash-and-carry trade can be found by comparing the 30d flows into the US Spot ETFs and Open Interest across CME Futures contracts. Both of these metrics have experienced strong growth during the up-trending market between Oct and Dec 2024.
However, as long-side bias starts to soften in the market, an unwinding of the carry-trade appears to be underway. This has resulted in substantial ETF outflows, and the closure of a similar volume of futures positions.
Closing out these positions requires selling of the ETFs. Since the ETFs tend to trade with lighter volume than the futures markets, this can create additional headwinds for spot Bitcoin markets, whilst the futures markets are often large enough to absorb the additional volume.
Live Chart
Demand for Downside Protection
As Bitcoin and the digital asset landscape continues to mature and institutionalize, the size of options markets continues to grow. This is largely due to the versatility of the instrument, allowing investors to deploy sophisticated strategies, and fine tune their risk management strategies.
One metric we can use to gauge institutional investor sentiment and risk appetite is the Volatility Smile, showing the implied volatility premium paid for different puts or calls at various strike prices.
Currently, we can observe a higher premium exists for puts, suggesting that downside protection is comparatively more expensive. This reflects a prevailing market sentiment where downside protection carries a premium.
Live Chart
We can also see this within the Options 25 Delta Skew metric, which evaluates the difference in implied volatility for puts and calls with the same delta.
We can see a sustained uptrend in delta skew for the 1-week and 1-month contracts, suggesting that puts are increasingly more expensive than equivalent calls. This again underscores risk-averse behavior, and a heightened demand for downside protection.
Live Chart
Short-Term Holders Under Pressure
We have established that a broad contraction in liquidity is occurring across both the on-chain, and in derivative markets. In the next section, we will assess how this has affected Short and Long-Term Holder cohorts in the on-chain space.
A commonly used tool for assessing investor stress is the unrealized loss metric, which reflects the dollar value of paper losses held by investors. The recent downtrend has plunged a substantial number of Short-Term Holder coins into an underwater position, with their relative unrealized loss nearly reaching the +2œÉ threshold.
Despite these elevated paper losses, the financial damage carried by new investors remains largely in line with the yen-carry-trade unwind on 5-Aug-2024. It is also aligned with the upper-bound values we have seen in most prior bull markets.
The scale of unrealized losses is also considerably less severe than those experienced during the May 2021 sell-off, and in the 2022 bear market.
Live Chart
When evaluating the rolling 30-day sum of Short-Term Holder losses, we note that a large portion of new investors has capitulated under the immense drawdown pressure, with the current sell-off representing the largest sustained loss-taking event of the cycle ($7B).
Note again however, that the magnitude of losses is still far smaller than the previously mentioned capitulation events.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holders Remain Calm
Switching our focus towards the Long-Term Holder cohort, we note that their spending pressure is beginning to wane. One way we can quantify this is by using the Binary Spending Indicator, which is designed to spot when Long-term Holders are spending a significant proportion of their holdings in a sustained manner.
We note that the Binary Spending Indicator has begun to slow down, and pull back. Long-Term Holder supply is also beginning to climb after several months of decline.
This suggests that there is a greater willingness to hold, than to spend coins amongst this cohort. This perhaps represents a shift in sentiment, with Long-Term Holder behavior moving away from sell-side distribution.
Live Chart
We can evaluate the percentage of the total Long-Term Holder balance sent to exchange addresses. By this metric, we can see a pronounced, but swift spike in distribution as the market traded down into the low-$80k range. This suggests that some long-term investors opted to de-risk, taking profits off the table amidst the uptick in volatility.
However, the intensity and magnitude of each distribution wave appears to be getting smaller. This perhaps alludes to a degree of saturation being reached amongst Long-Term Holders, where they have completed a majority of their sell-side activity within the current price range.
Live Chart
Bull markets are typically punctuated by intense sell-side pressure and profit taking from long-term investors, which is balanced by buy-side demand from new market participants.
The metric below assesses the cumulative profit realized by Long-Term Holders since the previous cycle ATH was broken. We can then quantify the sell-side pressure that each cycle has absorbed, providing a proxy for the demand-side which was required to absorb it and sustain the bull market.
Interestingly, the amount of profit realized by LTHs this cycle is within a similar range to previous cycles, evidencing the significant volume of sell-side pressure that the market has absorbed.
However, it is also worth noting that the LTH the cohort still holds a comparatively large amount of the total wealth, especially for this later-stage of the cycle. This interesting observation may indicate a more unique market dynamic moving forwards, as a relatively large pool of capital remains tightly held.
Live Chart
Conclusions
A decline in speculation activity across digital assets is now apparent, with investors taking an increasingly risk-adverse stance. This is evidenced by the contraction in liquidity occurring across both on-chain and futures markets. Additionally, the options market continues to price a higher premium for downside protection.
When we look at the investor response to volatility, we see two divergent stories. First, Short-Term Holders are taking some of the largest losses of the cycle, reflecting a degree of fear. Long-Term Holders on the other hand, have slowed their spending, seeming to move away from sell-side distribution, and perhaps back towards patient accumulation and holding."
2025,12,2025-W12,2025-03-17,2025-03-23,Bearish,84011.40,86092.94,84539.78,2.48,Disagree,"Executive Summary
New demand inflows continue to wane, evidenced by a stark contraction in profit and loss volumes absorbed by the market.
The magnitude of profit and loss locked in by investors is now similar to the later stages of the 2024 accumulation range, with prices trading between $50k-$70k.
The number of Short-Term Holder coins in loss has recorded its largest value since 2018, suggesting the majority of new-investors are now underwater on their position. However, the dollar value of loss held across these coins remains in-line with previous bull market conditions.
Long-Term Holder supply is beginning to grow once more, highlighting an investor preference for HODLing and accumulating supply.

Demand Side Wanes
Demand-side pressure remain relatively light at the moment, with Bitcoin‚Äôs price continuing to oscillate back and forth within a newly established trading range centred around $85k. One way we can quantify demand is by assessing the volume of realized profit and loss locked in by investors, providing critical information on the sell-side forces occurring across spot markets.
We can explore this phenomenon through two key concepts:
Capital Inflows
: Fresh capital entering the network as a new buyer purchases a coin at a premium to the sellers original cost basis (thus locking in a realized profit).
Capital Destruction
: Holders who have sold at a loss (a realized loss), with a new investor picking up the coins at a discount from its original buy-price.
Ultimately, this metric describes the premium, or discount a seller was willing to transact at, and the market price at which a buyer on the other side of the trade was willing to accept.
Currently, combined realized profit and loss volumes have experienced a major contraction since the $109k ATH, collapsing from 3.4B$ to 508M$ (-85%). This metric is now recording a similar value to that seen during the 2024 accumulation zone between $50k and $70k, suggesting a similar demand profile.
Live Chart
We can also notice a dichotomy in the spending behavior occurring between the Long and Short-Term Holder cohorts.
Notably, the entirety of loss taking is originating from the Short-Term Holder cohort, who represent the most recent buyers, and thus the most likely to have bought in at higher prices. The unpredictable and volatile market conditions of late has clearly been a challenging landscape for new investors to navigate.
Conversely, the lions share of profit taking is being realized by the Long-Term Holder cohort, who through their extended time in the market, remain in an entirely profitable position.
Live Chart
Sustainable bull markets are typically characterized by consistent and growing inflows of fresh capital entering the network, with capital inflow events significantly outsizing those of capital destruction.
When assessing the difference between Long-Term Holder profit taking, and Short-Term Holder loss realization, we can see that this metric has returned to a neutral zone. Long-term Holder profits are now being offset by an equivalent volume of Short-Term Holder losses.
This suggests a relative stagnation in new capital inflows, weaker demand-side forces, and a slowing but still meaningful volume of profit taking acting as resistance.
Live Chart
A Top Heavy Market?
The Short-Term Holder cohort are responsible for the majority of loss taking events in a bull market. This is usually the case during both local market corrections, as well as last-gasp sell-off when the market transitions into a protracted bearish structure. Therefore, they become the primary cohort to analyze when gauging the severity and potential depth of a market drawdown.
Recent downside volatility has created strenuous conditions for new investors, with the volume of Short-Term Holder supply held in loss surging to a massive 3.4M BTC. This is the largest volume of STH supply in loss since July 2018.
Live Chart
From a relative perspective, the percent supply in loss metric has now broken above its +1SD band, with over 90% of the Short-Term Holder supply now residing in an underwater position.
This degree of Short-Term Holder loss has only occurred twice during our current bull market, namely during the Aug 2023 downturn, and the Aug 2024 Yen-Carry-Trade unwind.
This highlights the gravity of the pressure currently being experienced by new investors, and increases the probability of a market wide capitulation event.
Live Chart
Another way to evaluate the pressure on the Short-Term Holders is to assess the cost-basis of each individual age-band subset within the cohort. We can consider these as a sort of fast-to-slow ribbon of cost basis levels, providing a sort of momentum indicator:
< 24hr: $89.9k
< 1wk: $87.6k
< 1m: $87.4k
< 3m: $94.6k
< 6m: $93.0k
A key takeaway from this insight is that most of the STHs who have held for at least 1 month are underwater on their position. Unrealized losses are permeating throughout the Short-Term Holder cohort, creating significant financial pressure and stress for investors.
Live Chart
Unrealized Potential
In the previous section, we determined that a significant volume of Short-Term Holder coins are now held in loss. To complement this analysis, we can also evaluate the aggregate dollar value of unrealized losses (paper losses) held by these coins.
Using both of these metrics, we can better understand the magnitude of the financial damage held by recent buyers, and compare it across two related dimensions.
From the perspective of the unrealized loss metric (paper losses), Short-Term Holders are holding relatively elevated losses, being some of the largest of this cycle. However, the magnitude of paper losses remains near the upper-bound of values we have seen during most prior bull markets.
This suggests that whilst the financial stress investors are experiencing is meaningful, it is also not yet at levels which would be considered unexpected, or atypical for a bull market uptrend.
Live Chart
Bull markets have historically reached their zenith after the majority of the network wealth has been distributed from long-term tenured investors, to new and increasingly price sensitive speculators. These speculators eventually hold a majority of the supply at an elevated cost basis, making them highly sensitive to downside price action.
Presently, Short-Term Holders hold approximately 40% of the network wealth, after peaking at a value of 50% early in 2025. This peak remains notably lower than in previous cycles, where the wealth held by new investors peaked at around 70%-90% near the cycle peak.
There are a few potential explanations for this:
The 2023-25 cycle has thus far experienced more lengthy sideways periods of consolidation. This has allowed a progressive redistribution of supply, followed by investors becoming acclimated to new price altitudes.
Bitcoin in 2025 is better understood by both retail and institutional investors alike. As a result, Long-Term Holders may be more likely to hold onto more of their supply for a longer period of time, having developed a stronger conviction.
The presence of larger institutional investors, and the ETFs may have longer term time horizons and allocation preferences. As such, a larger proportion of the supply may be held for lengthy periods of time.
There are likely many factors influencing this dynamic, and it highlights and evolution in the Bitcoin investment thesis of both new and existing Bitcoin holders.
Live Chart
Forging Long-Term Holders
Periods when the Bitcoin price rises significantly are often accompanied by an uptick in the intensity of sell-side pressure as investors take profit. Historically, Long-Term Holders have been the primary cohort capitalising on higher prices during bull markets.
A unique market dynamic is developing within the prevailing cycle, with oscillating waves of LTH distribution followed by periods of accumulation, creating a more controlled and stable market environment. There have been two main waves of distribution and accumulation thus far:
Distribution Wave 1: LTHs distributed -929k BTC
Accumulation Wave 1: LTHs accumulated +817k BTC
Distribution Wave 2: LTHs distributed -1.11M BTC
Accumulation Wave 2: Currently +278k BTC
Across the two distribution waves, over 2M BTC in sell-side pressure has been absorbed. Generally speaking, this volume of sell-side has been enough to conclude previous bull markets, however, the periods of following re-accumulation have acted to offset a large portion of the distribution thus far.
This balance between periods of distribution and accumulation may be a key factor giving rise to the orderly price structure we are experiencing, where price surges create intense distribution and profit taking, but are followed by side-ways price action as investors re-accumulate supply.
Live Chart
Further evidence to support a second wave of accumulation being underway can be found within the wealth held by coins aged 3m-6m. This is a very specific cohort as it exists at the transition boundary between the Short-Term Holder and Long-Term Holder cohorts. It captures the pool of supply which is most likely to migrate into LTH status over the coming weeks and months.
Presently, the 3m-6m cohort is experiencing a large uptick in total wealth held, suggesting that coins which were acquired when the market first traded up to $100k are starting to age into this bracket.
This group represents the top buyers who have not yet capitulated under the market conditions, underscoring a degree of investor confidence and patience. This behavior can be viewed as a precursor to Long-Term Holder supply growth, provided the cohort continues to HODL on.
Live Chart
Additionally, when we normalize the volume which is spent by this cohort, we can see that their spending activity is the most subdued in has been since the May 2021 downturn.
This confirms a dominance of inactivity amongst these investors, suggesting that the incentive to HODL remains quite strong, and many are undeterred by their paper losses and the volatile market conditions.
Live Chart
The flip side of these observations is that the Long-Term Holder cohort still retains a substantial portion of the network wealth, holding almost 40% of invested value.
These periods of HODLing and accumulation can create a gradual constriction of the supply-side, which over time, can create the conditions for a new wave of demand to establish the next uptrend.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
With the Bitcoin market trading within a new range between $78k and $88k. On-chain profit and loss taking events are declining in magnitude, highlighting a weaker demand profile, but also less sell-side pressure.
Short-Term Holders are currently experiencing a fairly significant degree of financial stress, with a large proportion of their holdings now underwater relative to the original cost basis. Whilst the STH cohort are dominating losses taken, the Long-Term Holder cohort are transitioning back into a period of accumulation, and we expect their aggregate supply to grow in the coming weeks and months as a result."

The Bitcoin market continues to consolidate within the $76k to $87k range, with the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio starting to show signs of near-term seller exhaustion but not yet a renewal of sustained bullish momentum.
A longer-term view reveals a deterioration of investor profitability, and an on-chain ‚ÄòDeath-Cross‚Äô has occurred, suggesting the market may remain weak for the foreseeable future.
Supply in loss remains elevated at 4.7M BTC, while the behavior of coins held in-loss is signalling moderate investor stress. Together, these metrics build a picture of deepening bearish conditions.

The Week On-chain Dashboard.
Short-Term Relief
Recent weeks in digital asset markets have been defined by a steady downtrend, with Bitcoin prices trading -30% below the ATH. During this correction, the $76k to $85k zone has emerged as a critical area of interest, with the market trading in this range since late February. Each sell-off towards the range lows has been met with a swift recovery, suggesting the presence of strong reactive demand has shown up whenever prices trade below $80k.
To better understand these dynamics, we turn to the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio ‚Äî a metric that compares the USD volume of realized profits versus losses. When this ratio falls below 1.0, it signals that more capital is being locked in a loss rather than a profit. These retests of the 1.0 level often coincide with local capitulation events and short-term price reversals.
Most notably, each dip into the $76k to $80k range has coincided with a P/L Ratio dipping below 1.0, highlighting episodes where losses outweighed profits. This imbalance typically marks a degree of seller exhaustion, where downside momentum fades as sell-side pressure is absorbed.
The resulting rebound appears as relief rallies, but we have not yet seen signs of renewed and sustained strength, reflecting a market which is still processing the emotional and financial hangover of the $109k ATH peak.
Live Chart
Zooming Out
Although short-term seller exhaustion can provide momentary relief, a deeper question emerges:
Are these rebounds signs of a larger bullish impulse or simply reactive bounces within a broader downtrend?
While some market participants may speculate that repeated bounce-backs from the $76k‚Äì$80k range could eventually rally toward new all-time highs, a longer-term perspective is necessary to gauge the sustainability of such momentum.
The Realized Profit/Loss Ratio
on
is traditionally shown on a logarithmic scale due to its volatility and wide range. To provide a clearer view of broader market dynamics, we have plotted a 90-day simple moving average to the metric on a linear scale. This smoothed presentation helps filter out the daily noise and highlights prevailing trends in spending profitability.
From this vantage point, the longer-term momentum has declined markedly since early January, despite the recent short-term spikes seen on the raw daily resolution. These brief profit-driven surges have failed to reverse the broader downtrend, suggesting that the macro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability.
So far, there is little evidence suggesting a structural bullish shift in momentum is underway.
Live Chart
An On-Chain Death Cross
With profitability trending lower, it‚Äôs logical to turn our attention to price momentum as a core driver behind investors locking in both profit and loss.
Traditionally, technical analysts identify major shifts in momentum when a ‚Äú
Death Cross
‚Äù occurs, indicating where the 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day. This event often signals a weakening trend.
To bring this concept into the on-chain domain, we construct an analogue using on-chain volume-weighted prices for coins moved in the last 1 month compared to the last 6 months. This method directly reflects market sentiment by factoring in both when and how much capital actually moves on-chain.
The recent crossover of the short-term 1-month average below the long-term 6-month price could be considered to mark an on-chain Death Cross. This pattern has historically preceded 3‚Äì6 month-long bearish trends. If this cycle follows suit, it suggests the market may still be working through a period of weakness before the bulls can reestablish a robust uptrend.

Following signs of weakening momentum and shrinking profitability, the current market structure ticks nearly many of the boxes we look at for a typical bear market phase. The current market is characterized by tighter liquidity conditions, negative sentiment and momentum, and investor behaviour increasingly moving toward loss-taking events.
In such environments, investor psychology is dominated by fear and emotional fatigue. Historically, the most extreme bearish phases tend to culminate with a capitulation event, often setting the stage for bottom formation and an eventual recovery.
A comprehensive analysis of bearish markets involves two key dimensions:
loss dominance and loss intensity
. Loss dominance is captured by the Total Supply held in Loss, which tracks the volume of coins held below their on-chain acquisition price. On March 30, 4.7M BTC  were held below their cost basis, which is an elevated level, though still below extremes seen in mid-2021, the 2022 bear market, and during the September 2024 drawdown.
Sizing up these losses helps frame where we are in the cycle and whether the market is deep in despair, nearing exhaustion, or may still have more pain to endure.
Live Chart
Measuring Loss Intensity
Building on our view of loss dominance, the second dimension of investor stress is loss intensity, which captures how far below the cost basis investor holdings are. To assess this, we turn to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that compares the spot price to the average cost basis of all coins in the supply.
To isolate the experience of underwater investors, we can focus specifically on the MVRV of supply held in loss. We can construct this metric by dividing the total USD-denominated unrealized loss held by the market by the number of coins contributing to it.
The Relative unrealized loss
,
which expresses the proportion of the market cap that is underwater, is currently at 2%. This is notably lower in magnitude than what we have seen in previous bear markets, such as in 2022. By this measure, whilst the number of coins held in loss is substantial, the magnitude of the unrealized losses they carry is not.
Live Chart
From this, we can compute the average cost basis of coins in loss using the following formula:
The realized price for the supply in loss is at $96.7k, which means, on average, the average underwater coin is holding an unrealized loss of -12%.
Live Chart
This Supply-in-Loss Realized Price then serves as the denominator for constructing an MVRV ratio for these coins, creating an oscillator to compare how far underwater the average loss-holding investors are. We can then use this metric to compare across previous cycles and use this as an input for identifying how deep the investor distress is and whether there are any early signs of recovery.
The Supply-in-Loss MVRV dropped sharply when the price broke below $93k and is now trading at 0.88, indicating a moderate degree of loss and stress within the market. This is one of the lowest levels of this MVRV for this cycle, although it is again not at the deeply low levels seen in prior bear markets.
Overall, there are many signs of weakness for Bitcoin investors. However, we should note that the magnitude of this weakness across several dimensions is not yet at the depth and severity of some of the more brutal downtrends Bitcoin has experienced in the past.
Live Chart
Rippling Away
As Bitcoin investors grapple with deepening losses, a contrasting trend emerges in more retail-driven corners of the market. One defining feature of this cycle has been the rise of institutional demand via U.S. spot ETFs, with a lot of retail participation and speculation pulled toward alternative digital assets.
For this cycle in particular, Ripple (XRP) has been a preferred asset for trade amongst retail investors, and studying its behavior can, therefore, serve as a proxy for measuring retail speculative demand.
Since the 2022 cycle low, the quarterly average of daily active addresses for XRP has jumped by +490%, compared to just 10% for Bitcoin. This stark contrast suggests that retail enthusiasm has been attracted by XRP, thus providing a mirror for speculative appetite in the crypto space.
Live Chart
This becomes even clearer when we examine the path each asset has taken since the 2022 cycle low. While both Bitcoin and XRP have delivered a similar performance, both trading, roughly 5x to 6x off the bottom, the journey has been fundamentally different.
Bitcoin‚Äôs rally has followed a more organic and progressive trajectory, marked by steady growth and punctuated by sharp uptrends during key catalysts such as the launch of spot ETFs and developments around the U.S. elections.
In contrast, XRP traded largely sideways until December 2024 before experiencing an explosive surge higher, a price pattern more consistent with retail-driven speculation than with a structured and sustained inflow of new demand.
Live Chart
During this recent surge, XRP‚Äôs Realized Cap nearly doubled from $30.1B to $64.2B, reflecting a substantial inflow of capital. Notably, close to $30B of this increase came from investors deploying capital within the last six months, highlighting the short concentration of this retail-led rally.
However, this capital influx has started to slow down since late February 2025, signalling a potential cooling-off in speculative appetite.
Live Chart
Alongside the short surge in capital flows, there‚Äôs been a rapid concentration of wealth in the hands of new investors, with the share of XRP‚Äôs realized cap, which is younger than 6 months, rising from 23% to 62.8% in just a short period of time.
When viewed together with the heavy retail participation, this sharp uplift in new holders raises caution signs, where many investors are likely to be vulnerable to downside volatility, given their now elevated cost basis.
Live Chart
This resembles a top-heavy cost basis structure, which becomes even more concerning when we observe the Realized Loss/Profit Ratio for XRP. This metric has been in steady decline since January 2025, suggesting that investors are realizing fewer profits and increasingly large losses.
These conditions are a common signal of waning confidence and a general move towards more fragile, higher-risk conditions. Given the retail-dominated inflows and largely concentrated wealth in relatively new hands, this alludes to a condition where retail investor confidence in XRP may be slipping, and this may also be extended across the broader market.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market continues to digest the correction after the $109k ATH, with signs of increasing losses held, and locked in by investors. Although the price has stabilized above an area of demand around $76k‚Äì$80k, several on-chain momentum indicators suggest these may be relief rallies within a broader downtrend rather than the beginning of a sustainable reversal.
Analysis of XRP network trends also offers a proxy view for the magnitude of the risk appetite of retail investors. The asset has seen a dramatic uptick in address activity, capital inflows, and realized cap growth over the last 6 months. However, this enthusiasm appears to have reached a saturation point as profit-taking wanes and losses have started to accelerate. The XRP market is showing signs of a top-heavy structure, with many investors caught on a relatively high-cost basis.
Altogether, this data reinforces a case where Bitcoin's correction is meaningful in scale but has not yet reached the severity of previous bear markets. For more speculative assets like XRP, demand may have already peaked, suggesting caution may be warranted until signs of a robust recovery start to emerge."

The announcement of US tariffs has caused significant disruption to major financial markets, with many experiencing some of their worst trading days since March 2020.
Capital inflows into the major digital assets have ground to a halt, causing major headwinds and a contraction of liquidity.
However, loss-taking events across Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be reducing in scale with each price leg lower, suggesting investors may be approaching a degree of near-term seller exhaustion.
The collapse across digital assets has been broad-based, with the altcoin market devaluing from $1T in Dec 2024 to a current value of $583B.
Confluence between on-chain and technical models suggests that $93k is a key area of interest which must be reclaimed before upward momentum is re-established. On the downside, the $65k to $71k region remains a critical threshold for the Bitcoin bulls to hold.

A Broad-Based Decline
The announcement of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù Tariffs has sent shock-waves through financial markets, with major indexes experiencing a unilateral decline. The US administration‚Äôs policy stance has shifted toward seeking a weaker U.S. dollar, lower interest rates, softer oil prices, and a contraction in fiscal spending. The combination of these factors may result in a marked slowdown in the US economy and a substantial contraction in overall liquidity.
This tariff-related uncertainty has acted as a catalyst for a widespread risk-off event, catalyzing a sell-off across most major financial indices, with many markets experiencing their worst trading days since March 2020.
Source: Yahoo Finance
The digital asset market, which tends to have a heightened response to changes in global liquidity, has not escaped the drawdown, with many digital assets experiencing heavy double-digit percentage-point declines in prices.
Bitcoin, the leading digital asset, experienced a contraction from $83.5k to $74.5k, reflecting a $150B decline in the market cap. Ethereum, the second largest digital asset took even more of a beating, with the ETH price falling from $1800 to $1380, resulting in a market cap contraction of $40B.
Live Chart
Since the start of the year, capital inflows across both major assets have clearly reduced. This is largely reflected in the 30-day Realized Cap change, which assesses the monthly change in the assets' net capital flow.
Bitcoin peaked at a capital inflow rate of $100B/mth, which has now contracted to +$6B/mth.
Ethereum peaked at a capital inflow rate of +$15.5B/mth and is now experiencing a capital outflow of -$6B/mth.
Net capital flows across the Bitcoin network are beginning to grind to a halt, suggesting a lack of fresh capital entering the asset to support higher prices. The capital outflows for Ethereum are a result of ETH, which was acquired at higher prices, being spent at lower prices, locking in a net capital loss relative to its acquisition price. This generally suggests that Ethereum is experiencing more headwinds relative to Bitcoin, which is being reflected in the weaker price performance.
Live Chart
If we anchor the total change in the realized cap since the collapse of FTX in late 2022, we can quantify the magnitude of capital absorbed by both Bitcoin and Ethereum since the cycle low.
The Bitcoin Realized Cap increased from $402B to $870B, adding +$468B in size (+117%).
The Ethereum Realized Cap increased from $183B to $244B, adding +$61B in size (+32%).
This disparity in capital inflows between the two assets partly underscores why these assets have experienced diverging performance since 2023. Ethereum has experienced a relatively smaller inflow of demand and fresh capital this cycle, which has resulted in weaker price appreciation and a lack of a fresh ATH, despite Bitcoin prices reaching over $100k in December.
Live Chart
The MVRV Ratio describes the ratio between the spot price and the realized price, gauging the magnitude of unrealized profit held on average for each asset. Values above 1 signal an average unrealized profit, and trading below 1 indicates an unrealized loss.
Again, we can see a notable divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum MVRV Ratios since the beginning of the bull market cycle in January 2023. Bitcoin investors have consistently held a greater magnitude of unrealized gains compared to their Ethereum counterparts, with the ETH MVRV Ratio dipping back below 1.0 in March.
Live Chart
By calculating the difference between the BTC and ETH MVRV Ratios, we can identify periods during which the average Bitcoin holder is outperforming (or underperforming) the average Ethereum holder in terms of paper gains held.
A positive spread indicates that Bitcoin investors, on average, are holding greater unrealized profits than their Ethereum investor counterparts.
A negative spread implies higher average profitability amongst Ethereum investors.
As previously noted, Bitcoin investors have maintained a higher average profitability relative to Ethereum investors since the onset of the current bull market. This trend has now extended for 812 consecutive days, marking the longest such period on record.
Live Chart
As evidenced, a relatively smaller influx of investor demand has been a primary factor in Ethereum's softer performance this cycle. The growing divergence between the two major digital assets is best highlighted by assessing the ETH / BTC price ratio.
When measuring from the Merge in September 2022, the ETH/BTC ratio has collapsed from a value of 0.080 to a current value of 0.0196, reflecting a -75% decline. This is the lowest value of this pair since Jan 2020, with only 500 / 3531 trading days recording a lower value.
We can also see that the current bull market has lacked any extended periods where Ethereum significantly outperformed Bitcoin, which is highly atypical of bull market conditions and further evidence of an unusual deviation in the historical patterns and performance digital asset investors are used to.
Live Chart
Inspecting Losses
In the wake of an aggressive market drawdown like we have seen this week, it is prudent to inspect the reaction of investors, particularly since bear markets are typically initiated by periods of heightened fear and substantial losses.
By evaluating the 6-hour rolling window for realized losses, we can better understand the behavior and disposition of market participants within the current downturn.
Investor capitulation events for Bitcoin have been sizeable, with a peak of $240M in losses locked in across the 6-hour window. This is of a similar scale to some of the largest loss events of the cycle.
However, the magnitude of losses realized during this drawdown has started to decrease with each successive price leg lower. This suggests a form of near-term seller-exhaustion may be starting to develop within this price range.
Live Chart
A similar behavior pattern can be seen for Ethereum, with losses locked in throughout the recent drawdown reaching a peak value of $564M. This puts the current sell-off as one of the largest loss-taking events since the start of the bull market in January 2023.
The severity of realized losses for both assets is decreasing with each leg lower, which perhaps points to investors becoming more accustomed to lower price ranges and tumultuous market conditions.
Live Chart
Broad Contraction
The prevailing contraction in market liquidity has triggered a significant devaluation across the entire altcoin sector, with assets further out on the risk curve exhibiting heightened sensitivity to liquidity shocks, usually resulting in more severe drawdowns.
As of December 2024, the aggregate altcoin market capitalization (excludes BTC, ETH and Stablecoins) had reached a cycle peak of $1T. Since then, it has retraced sharply, declining to $583B, a drawdown of over -40% across just a handful of months.
Live Chart
Notably, there has been a lack of idiosyncratic behavior amongst the altcoin subsectors during this drawdown. The contraction appears broad-based, with all sectors experiencing a significant devaluation, with even Bitcoin recording a negative performance over the last 3 months.
Live Dashboard
Range Navigation
To close out, we will assess how the market is reacting to key technical and on-chain cost-basis levels, which provide tools to help navigate choppy and uncertain market conditions.
Technical analysis has been a cornerstone tool for investors for many decades, and Bitcoin investors tend to respond to a certain set of moving averages. The 111DMA, 200DMA and 365DMA are commonly used for assessing the momentum of the Bitcoin market.
This can be considered under the following framework
The sharp sell-off below the 111DMA ($93k) indicated the first major hit to market momentum, with the market marking no significant attempt to reclaim the level.
Following the first sell-off, price oscillated around the 200DMA ($87k), commonly considered as a bull/bear threshold by many technical analysts. Indecision around this pricing level eventually led to rejection and the next major price leg lower.
Most recently, the price crashed below the 365DMA ($76k) for the first time since the 2021 cycle. This is a key momentum level that has thus far held as support but needs to remain as support to avoid further downside momentum from being established.
Live Chart
During bull market uptrends, Short-Term Holder (STH) investors are often responsible for the majority of loss-taking events during capitulation events. Changes in their behavior and sentiment can provide critical insight into the severity of market corrections and how investors are responding to it.
The STH cost basis has historically functioned as a critical benchmark level for evaluating market momentum during uptrends. We can construct ¬±1 standard deviation bands around the STH cost basis, which have typically acted as a form of upper and lower bound for local price action.
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis +1œÉ: $131k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis: $93k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis -1œÉ: $72k
Bitcoin‚Äôs initial drop below the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis (STH-CB) signalled the first sign of weakening momentum (alongside the break below the 111DMA). This was confirmed when the price rallied into the underside of this level and was rejected, reinforcing a shift in investor sentiment.
The spot Bitcoin price is now firmly between the STH-CB and its lower -1œÉ band, with these levels defining the boundaries of our trading range between $93k and $72k.
Live Chart
The Active Realized Price and True Market Mean are another set of price models, often trading near the midpoint of Bitcoin cycles. These two models represent a cost basis estimate for active market participants by discounting lost and long-dormant supply.
Statistically speaking, approximately 50% of trading days see the spot price trade above/below these pricing models, allowing them to serve as a key mean reversion model and a threshold delineating bullish and bearish market regimes.
Active Realized Price: $71k
True Market Mean: $65k
We now have confluence across several on-chain price models, highlighting the $65k to $71k price range as a critical area of interest for the bulls to establish long-term support. Should price trade meaningfully below this range, a super-majority of active investors would be underwater on their holdings, with likely negative impacts on aggregate sentiment to follow.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Pressure across global financial markets continues to escalate, driven by mounting uncertainty around the U.S. tariff regime. This weakness has permeated nearly all asset classes, as evidenced by a significant drawdown across all major macro indices.
Digital asset markets have been no exception, experiencing a broad contraction across all market sub-sectors. Bitcoin has traded as far down as $75k, marking one of the deepest drawdowns since the start of the bull cycle in January 2023. Ethereum has been hit even harder, and many longer-tail digital assets are now deep into bearish market trends.
Using a set of both on-chain and technical price models, the $65k to $71k region emerges as a key area of interest for the bulls to re-establish long-term support. If Bitcoin prices fall below this, it is likely sentiment will take a large hit, as a super-majority of active investors will be underwater on their holdings."

The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain with the restructuring of global trade relations ongoing. This uncertainty has contributed to heightened volatility across both the U.S. Treasury and equity markets.
In response to the challenging economic backdrop, Bitcoin has recorded its largest drawdown of the cycle. Nevertheless, this remains within typical bounds of previous corrections during bull markets. Additionally, the median drawdown of the cycle remains an order of magnitude lower than previous iterations, highlighting a more resilient demand profile.
Liquidity across the digital asset ecosystem continues to tighten, reflected in declining capital inflows and stagnation in stablecoin growth.
Investors are under considerable stress, currently facing the largest unrealized losses on record. However, the bulk of these losses are concentrated among newer market participants, while Long-Term Holders remain broadly in profit.

Macro Uncertainty Remains Rife
Uncertainty looms large across the macroeconomic landscape, with the Trump administration aiming to upend and restructure the status-quo of global trade relationships. As it stands, U.S Treasuries operate as the collateral and foundation of the financial system, with the 10yr Treasury considered to be the benchmark risk-free rate.
A key aim of the administration has been to lower the yield of the 10yr Treasury, and they found initial success in the opening months of the year with yields trading down to 3.7% as wider markets sold off. However, this was fleeting, as yields have since surged back to 4.5%, erasing this progress, and creating significant volatility within the bond market.
Source: FRED
We can quantify the disorderly behavior of the bond market by way of the MOVE Index. This metric is a key indicator for bond market stress and volatility, derived from the implied 30-day volatility in the U.S. Treasury market based on option prices across various maturities.
By this measure, volatility in U.S treasures has surged higher, underscoring the extreme degree of uncertainty and fear amongst bond market investors.
Source: Tradingview
We can also measure disruption in U.S equity markets using the VIX Index which measures the market‚Äôs expectation for 30-day volatility in the U.S. stock market. Volatility in the bond market has also notably manifested within the equities market, with the VIX now recording similar values of volatility to the 2020 COVID crisis, the 2008 GFC, and the 2001 Dot Com Bubble.
Volatility in the base collateral of the financial system tends to result in a pull-back of investor capital, and a tightening of liquidity conditions. Given Bitcoin and digital assets are one of the most liquidity sensitive instruments, they were naturally swept up in the volatility and risk asset drawdown.
Source: FRED
Amidst this turmoil, the performance of hard assets remains remarkably impressive. Gold continues to surge higher, having reached a new ATH of $3,300, as investors flee to the traditional safe haven asset. Bitcoin sold off to $75k initially alongside risk assets, but has since recovered the weeks gains, trading back up to $85k, now flat since this burst of volatility.
As the world adjusts to changing trade relationships, Gold and Bitcoin are increasingly entering the centre stage as global neutral reserve assets. Thus, one can argue there is a fascinating signal in the performance of Gold and Bitcoin during last weeks events.
Live Chart
Bitcoin Remains Resilient
Whilst it is impressive to observe Bitcoin still trading within the $85k region, the leading digital asset has still experienced heightened volatility and drawdowns in recent months. The asset has recorded its largest drawdown in the 2023-25 cycle, reaching a max pull-back of -33% below its ATH.
However, the magnitude of the drawdown remains within the typical bounds of previous corrections during bull markets. In prior macroeconomic events like last week, Bitcoin has typically experienced greater than -50% sell-offs in such events, which highlights a degree of robustness of modern investor sentiment towards the asset during unfavourable conditions.
Live Chart
To quantify the resilience of the current cycle, we can assess the rolling median drawdown profile for all bull market structures.
2011: -22%
2011-13: -18%
2015-18: -11%
2018-21: -19%
2022+: -7%
The median drawdown for the current cycle is considerably shallower than all previous cases. Drawdowns since 2023 have been shallower and more controlled in nature, suggesting a more resilient demand profile, and that many Bitcoin investors are more willing to HODL through market turmoil.
Live Chart
Liquidity Continues to Contract
We can also assess how macro uncertainty has affected the liquidity profile of Bitcoin.
One way we can measure Bitcoins internal liquidity is via the realized cap metric, which calculates the cumulative netflow of capital into a digital asset. The realized cap is trading at an ATH value of $872B, however, the rate of capital growth has compressed to only +0.9% per month.
Amidst an extremely challenging market backdrop, it is impressive capital flows into the asset remain positive. Given the rate of fresh capital entering the asset is softening, it does also suggest that investors are currently less willing to allocate capital in the near-term, suggesting risk-off sentiment is likely to remain the default behavior for the time being.
Live Chart
The Realized Profit and Loss metrics are the input components to the Realized Cap, enabling us to measure the difference between a coin‚Äôs acquisition price, and its value at the time it is spent on-chain.
Coins spent above their acquisition price are considered to lock in
Realized Profits.
Coins spent below their acquisition price are considered to lock in
Realized Losses.
By measuring Realized Profit and Loss in BTC terms, we can normalize all profit and loss-taking events relative to Bitcoin‚Äôs expanding market cap over cycles. Here, we introduce a new variant, which is further refined by adjusting for volatility (7-day realized volatility), helping to account for the diminishing returns and growth rate as Bitcoin matures over its 16-year history.
At the moment, profit and loss taking activities are relatively balanced, which results in the relatively neutral rate of capital inflow noted earlier. It could be argued that this reflects a saturation in investor activity within the current price range, and typically preempts a period of consolidation as the market tries to find a new equilibrium.
Live Chart
By calculating the difference between the Realized Profit and Realized Loss, we can produce the Net Realized Profit / Loss metric. This metric measures the directional dominance of value flowing in/out of the network.
Utilizing the volatility adjusted Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, we can compare it to the cumulative median, seeking to distinguish between two market regimes.
Values consistently above the median typically signal a bull market, and net capital inflows.
Sustained values below the cumulative median is typically considered a bear market, with Bitcoin experiencing net capital outflows.
Markets routinely drive investors to the brink of maximum pain, typically reaching a peak at the turning point between a bull and a bear cycle. We can see how the volatility-adjusted Net Realized Profit/Loss oscillates around its long-term median, acting as a mean reversion tool.
This metric has now reset back to its neutral median value, suggesting the Bitcoin market is now at a key decision point, and draws a line in the sand for the bulls to re-establish support in the current price range.
Live Chart
Stablecoins have become a foundational asset class within the digital asset ecosystem, acting as the quote asset for trading on both centralized, and decentralized trading venues. Assessing liquidity through the lens of stablecoins provides an additional dimension to our analysis, providing a holistic lens into the digital asset liquidity profile.
The growth of stablecoin supplies remains positive, but is softening in recent weeks. This provides an additional layer of confluence that there has been a contraction in broader digital asset liquidity, as measured via a softer demand for digitally native dollars.
Live Chart
Inspecting Investor Pressure
Amid ongoing market turbulence, it's important to evaluate the scale of unrealized losses currently held by Bitcoin investors.
When measuring the Realized Cap across the supply held in loss, we note that it has reached an ATH of $410B during the market decline to $75k. When we inspect the composition of the unrealized losses, we can see that the majority of investors are holding drawdowns of up to -23.6%.
The Realized Cap of the supply held in loss is now larger in magnitude than the May 2021 sell-off and the 2022 bear market. However, it is worth noting that on an individual investor level, the market endured far steeper drawdowns of up to -61.8% and -78.6%, respectively.
Whilst the Realized Cap held in loss is larger (given Bitcoin is a larger asset today), individual investors are less challenged today compared to prior bear market periods.
Live Chart
Despite the ATH in Realized Cap held in loss, the percentage of the circulating supply held in a profitable position remains elevated at a value of 75%. This suggests the majority of underwater investors have been new buyers across the topping formation.
Of interest, the percent supply in profit is approaching its long-term mean. Historically, this this is a key area to defend before a super majority of coins fall into loss and a critical threshold between bull and bear market structures.
Bull markets are typically characterized with the supply in profit above its long-term mean, routinely finding support at this level across the regime.
Bear markets are historically punctuated with deep and sustained periods below the long-term mean, with frequent rejections at this level confirming the decline in profitability.
Similarly to the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, a rebound off of the long-term average band would be a positive observation if defended.
Live Chart
As the market continues to contract, it's reasonable to expect the absolute size of unrealized losses to grow. To account for this and normalize across drawdowns of varying magnitudes, we introduce a new variant of the metric:
Unrealized Loss per Percent Drawdown
, which expresses losses held in BTC terms relative to the percentage decline from the all-time high.
Applying this metric to the Short-Term Holder cohort reveals that their unrealized losses, when adjusted for the depth of the drawdown, are already substantial and comparable to levels observed during prior bear market onsets.
Live Chart
Nevertheless, current unrealized losses are largely concentrated among newer investors, while long-term holders remain in a position of unilateral profitability. However, an important nuance is emerging, as recent top buyers age into long-term holder status, as noted in
WoC 12
, the level of unrealized loss within this cohort is likely to increase.
Historically, substantial expansions in unrealized losses among long-term holders have often marked the confirmation of bear market conditions, albeit with a delay following the market peak. As of now, there is no clear evidence to suggest such a regime shift is underway.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
The macroeconomic landscape remains uncertain, marked by ongoing shifts in global trade dynamics which have fueled substantial volatility across U.S Treasury and equity markets. Notably, the performance of both Bitcoin and Gold in particular have remained remarkably robust across this challenging period. One could consider this a fascinating signal as the foundations of the financial system enter a period of transition and change.
Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs noteworthy resilience, it has not been immune to the heightened volatility seen across global markets, marking its largest drawdown of the 2023‚Äì2025 cycle. This has greatly affected newer market participants, who now hold the lions share of market losses. However, from an individual investor perspective, the market has endured far more severe drawdowns in prior cycles, notably during the May 2021 and 2022 bear markets. In addition, mature and tenured investors remain unfazed by the ongoing economic stress, and reside in a position of near unilateral profitability."

Bitcoin has surged to $94.7k following optimism around the potential easing of U.S.‚ÄìChina tariff tensions. The price briefly reclaimed the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis ($92.9k), which is a critical mid-point separating bearish and bullish market phases.
The Percent Supply in Profit climbed to 87.3%, up from 82.7% when BTC last traded at similar price levels. This indicates that nearly 5% of the supply changed hands during the recent correction.
The STH Profit/Loss Ratio hit 1.0, signalling many recent buyers are at break-even, a level often associated with exit risk. Realized profit has also spiked, driven largely by short-term investors locking in gains.
Futures open interest has increased by 15.6%. However, funding rates turned negative, showing rising short interest, despite the market trading higher.
On 22-April, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a record $1.54B in net inflows, showing a substantial influx of institutional demand. Normalized flow data shows BTC demand has far outpaced ETH demand via the ETFs, helping explain Ethereum‚Äôs relative underperformance.

The Week On-chain Dashboard.
After weeks of subdued activity and lower liquidity conditions, the market has finally responded positively to a broader macro catalyst. Following optimistic signals from the U.S. administration regarding tariff relief on Chinese imports, both equities and crypto markets have rallied higher.
In Bitcoin‚Äôs case, this rally has briefly broken above a crucial on-chain threshold: the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, currently at $92.9k. This model reflects the average acquisition price of market participants who recently acquired their coins, and often acts as a key pivot level. Historically, a sustained break above this price model has marked the transition between periods of bearish corrections and renewed bullish sentiment during recoveries.
However, much like the July‚ÄìSeptember 2024 period, this move has thus far only resulted in a momentary reclaim of the STH-Cost Basis. This indicates an initial spark of optimism, but has not yet confirmed a complete regime shift back into bullish territory. Sustained strength above this level is likely to improve market confidence, as more investors move back into a meaningful unrealized profit.
Live Chart
The market‚Äôs latest push to $94.3k has been accompanied by a noticeable recovery in unrealized profit held by investors. The Percent Supply in Profit metric has risen to 87.3%, marking a sharp rebound from the lows seen in March.
When Bitcoin last traded at ~$94k, only 82.7% of the supply was in profit. This means that since early March, nearly 5% of the circulating supply has changed hands at lower prices as the market chopped sideways and lower.
Historically, a typical euphoria phase tends to follow this metric stabilizing above 90% for an extended period, signalling widespread profitability and elevated investor confidence.
Live Chart
Another indicator that Bitcoin has returned to an important decision zone is the STH Supply Profit/Loss Ratio, which has recently surged back to its neutral level near 1.0. This suggests that short-term supply is more evenly split between coins in profit and loss, making this a point of balanced sentiment for this cohort.
This structure is significant, and prior bear markets have seen the STH-P/L Ratio trading well below 1, with that level acting as a resistance ceiling. Whenever this metric returns to retest 1.0 from below, it tends to correlate with the formation of a local top, as investors start to exit positions and dampen momentum.
If the market can convincingly reclaim this level and trade above 1.0, it would be a signal of a more robust recovery. Monitoring how this ratio trades over the coming weeks, especially alongside realized profit-taking behaviour, can help navigate whether the market is re-establishing a more constructive recovery out of this correction.
Live Chart
Profit-Taking Pressure Test
Now that we have a framework for a market which is at a decision point, profit-taking behaviour becomes a critical signal to monitor. Currently, the total Realized Profit on an hourly resolution has surged to $139.9M/hour, which is roughly 17% above its baseline of $120M/hour.
This uptick suggests that many market participants are using this rally to lock in gains. If the market can absorb this selling pressure without breaking down, it paints a more constructive picture on the road ahead.
Conversely, failure to hold these levels, under heavy profit realization, could mark this move as another dead cat bounce, which would be consistent with prior relief rallies that faded under similar conditions.
Live Chart
Who‚Äôs Taking Profit?
Beyond just the volume of realized gains, understanding which cohorts are realizing profit offers deeper insight into market sentiment. For this, we turn to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) ‚Äî a metric that compares the sale price of coins to their original cost basis, offering a lens into the average profit or loss multiple locked in by investors.
SOPR for Short-Term Holders (STH-SOPR) shows that during the recent surge, recent buyers are the primary cohort who are locking in profits.
This is the first significant break of STH-SOPR above the break-even level of 1.0 since late February, and is another relatively constructive sign of investors returning to a profitable position. Generally speaking, STH-SOPR trading consistently above 1.0 is a characteristic of bullish uptrends.
Live Chart
Short Side Perps
While some spot holders appear to be locking in profits, traders of perpetual swaps are tending to lean on the short side into the rally. The Open Interest of perpetual swaps has climbed sharply to 281k BTC, up ~15.6% since the low of 243k BTC set in early March.
This reflects an uptick in leverage within the derivatives markets, which can often amplify market swings if prices start to hit traders' stop-loss or liquidation zones.
Live Chart
Interestingly, this surge in open interest aligns with a decline in average funding rates, which plunged to -0.023%. This indicates a growing bias toward short-side positioning, suggesting that many traders are betting against the rally, potentially viewing the recent move as overextended.
This divergence between rising open interest and negative funding sets the stage for a possible short squeeze scenario if upward momentum continues.
Live Chart
However, when zooming out to assess longer-term sentiment among perpetual swap traders, the picture turns more cautious. The 7-day moving average of long-side funding paid per hour has declined steadily, now sitting at $88k/hour and still trending lower.
This metric serves as an indicator of the appetite for sustained long exposure, reflecting the dollar value paid by traders who are on the ‚Äòconsensus‚Äô side of the market. The current downtrend in premium signals that the majority of positions are indeed shifting towards the short side, which creates an incentive for market makers to take the long side to collect the funding rate interest.
Live Chart
Institutional Interest
ETF flows have become an important proxy for gauging institutional investor sentiment and demand this cycle. Tracking the flows in and out of the ETF products offers a unique lens into the conviction and participation of larger capital allocators.
During Bitcoin‚Äôs recent leg up to $94k, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a staggering $1.54B in net inflows in a single day, one of the highest daily figures since their inception. This influx sends a powerful signal that demand for Bitcoin may be starting to come back online.
Live Chart
Is It Still Bitcoin Season?
Whilst Bitcoin has seen a strong price rebound, many have questioned why Ethereum hasn‚Äôt followed suit to the same extent. One answer lies in a comparison of ETF flows, where we normalize and adjust by each asset‚Äôs relative spot volume.
Over the past two weeks, the Bitcoin ETFs have seen two distinct inflow waves, each exceeding 10% of BTC‚Äôs spot volume, and underscoring a relatively robust institutional demand profile.
By contrast, Ethereum ETF flows have remained quite subdued, with inflows of below 1% of ETH‚Äôs spot volume. This stark divergence highlights the disparity in institutional demand between the two assets, which paints a likely reason why ETH continues to lag behind BTC‚Äôs recent performance.
Live Chart
Conclusion & Discussion
Bitcoin‚Äôs surge back above $94k reflects a mix of macro optimism and shifting investor sentiment. Positive signals around U.S.‚ÄìChina tariffs triggered a rally that reclaimed the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis, and lifted the Percent Supply in Profit to 87.3%. Several metrics allude to a constructive recovery being underway for Bitcoin, with an added element of a short squeeze brewing in futures markets.
Institutional demand may be returning for Bitcoin, with the ETFs seeing $1.54B in net inflows in a single day. The market is very much at a decision point, and the key level to watch is the Short‚ÄîTerm Holder cost basis, which often delineates bullish and bearish market structure. The bulls need to drive the market above this price model, and keep it there."

Bitcoin price momentum is facing its first wave of meaningful resistance, as price attempts to consolidate and break above key technical and on-chain levels, namely the 111DMA ($91.3k) and the Short-Term Holder cost-basis ($93.2k).
Several structural resets are evident across multiple facets of the Bitcoin economy, indicating that much of the speculative excess has been flushed out during the recent downturn.
HOLDling remains the primary dynamic amongst LTHs as accumulation pressures continue to outweigh the propensity for investors to spend and de-risk.
If the market continues to rise, a notable increase in sell-side pressure is expected from Long-Term Holders who would now be holding over +350% unrealized profits. Furthermore, a dense cluster of coins sits above the spot price, suggesting some investors may opt to exit at or near their break-even price, providing an additional source of sell-side pressure.

Pricing Levels
Momentum in the recovery of the Bitcoin price is facing its first wave of meaningful resistance, as price attempts to consolidate and break above the $93k to $95k region. This price zone is the range low of a multi-month consolidation phase that price traded between Nov 2024 and Feb 2025. An important shift appears to be underway, with the spot price breaking the prevailing downtrend, and establishing a new higher high price pattern.
In this edition, we will utilize a host of on-chain and technical metrics to gauge the strength of the markets momentum, and evaluate the durability of this upward move through the lens of spending dynamics, and investor sentiment.
Live Chart
To investigate the current state of market momentum, we can evaluate how the market is responding to a combination of key technical and on-chain indicators. When these two models align, their confluence provides a stronger, more reliable signal.
In this analysis, we focus on the 111DMA, which is a technical average that many Bitcoin analysts employ for assessing momentum. Alongside this, we will use the Short-Term Holder cost basis, which has historically served as a critical pricing level delineating bullish and bearish market regimes.
111DMA: $91.3k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis: $93.2k
The price has recently surged above both of these pricing models, and is now attempting to consolidate within this zone. This highlights a noteworthy degree of strength behind this upwards swing.
However, these are levels that must be broken and held for further price appreciation
, as a rejection of this level would push the price back into bearish territory, and return many investors to a state of meaningful unrealized loss.
Live Chart
Market drawdowns are challenging times for investors, as financial pain typically increases as the depth and duration of the drawdown extends. We can assess the component of ‚Äòtime pain‚Äô by evaluating the number of days (out of last 90-days) where the spot price has traded below both of these levels.
Through this measure, the prevailing drawdown has experienced a similar duration to those seen throughout the cycle. Furthermore, we can see that the duration component has not reached the extreme levels normally associated with prolonged bear market regimes, suggesting the recent drawdown may not be of bear market proportions just yet.
Live Chart
We can increase the granularity of this observation by evaluating the cost-basis of various sub-groups within the Short-Term Holder cohort. We consider these as a sort of fast-to-slow ribbon of cost basis levels, providing a form of momentum indicator:
The recent market surge has shifted investors who have held coins for longer than 1-month into a profitable position. This has led to a notable reduction in financial pressure and stress on these investors, and can be considered as an early indication for positive market momentum if sustained.
Live Chart
A Market Reset
In this section of the article, we will present a series of charts to profile a set of resets which have taken place across many areas of the Bitcoin economy. These ‚Äòresets‚Äô are typical of corrections, where much of the local froth dissipates from the market.
The MVRV Ratio measures the degree of unrealized profit or loss held by the average investor. This metric provides insight into the financial pressures the average investor is experiencing, and can help identify periods when they are more likely to take chips off of the table (realized a profit), or to capitulate under drawdown pressure (realize a loss).
By assessing the long-term mean of the MVRV Ratio, as well as ¬±1 standard deviation bands, we are able to clearly delineate between market regimes.
Below -1 Standard Deviation: Deep bear market.
Between -1 and long-term mean: Recovery phase.
Above long-term mean: Early bull market.
Above +1 Standard Deviation: Euphoric bull market.
During this downtrend, investor unrealized gains have fallen back to their long-term mean (MVRV of 1.74). A similar market structure can be seen during the previous consolidation phase in 2024, which peaked during the yen-carry-trade unwind on 5-Aug-2024.
The long-term mean of MVRV effectively acts as a support level for investor confidence, and a sustained move of MVRV back above this level would be a constructive observation.
Live Chart
Next, we look towards the percentage of the circulating supply which is held in a profitable position. This metric simply considers the status of a coin from a binary perspective of ‚Äúin loss‚Äù or ‚Äúin profit‚Äù based on its original cost basis. This differs from the MVRV Ratio, which considers the USD magnitude of unrealized profit or loss (i.e. distance between spot price and cost basis).
The circulating supply which is held in a profitable position remains elevated, trading at a value of 88%. The only underwater investors are those who purchased coins during the Dec-Feb period, centred around $95k and $100k.
Similar to the MVRV Ratio, the percent of supply in profit has also recorded a strong bounce off its long-term mean, which bolsters our assessment that a meaningful reset of investor expectations is taking place.
Live Chart
Moving into the spending domain (analysis of coins moved each day), we can see a similar story emerges.
During the downtrend, the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio approached its break-even value, suggesting the size of profit and loss taking events were balanced. This displays a neutral sentiment across investors. The price rally has driven this ratio higher and back into profit dominated territory. This suggests the onset of a meaningful recovery, where profit taking activity returns, and demand has thus far been able to absorb it.
Live Chart
The above observation is also supported by the SOPR metric, which gauges the relative magnitude of profit or loss taken across each spent coin. It can be thought of as the average profit multiple locked in by spent coins each day.
SOPR has also found strong support at its equilibrium value of 1.0, and has remained within a profit dominated regime. It is constructive to observe swift and short undercuts of the neutral level, which suggests that investors who bought near the local top are being flushed out, and others are buying and defending their cost-basis.
Live Chart
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a powerful tool which can assess the degree of equilibrium the market has reached. We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio remains below its low value band, suggesting that most coins moved on-chain are transacting near their original acquisition price. Generally speaking, this indicates that the current price range is no longer an attractive area for investors to take profit or loss, and is typical of consolidation ranges, where a new range expansion is required to stimulate the next wave of capital flows.
Live Chart
HODLing On
As market conditions improve, Long-Term Holder spending volumes remain relatively light, indicating HODLing is the primary behavior amongst this cohort. The balance held by tenured investors continues to move higher, with +254k BTC migrating across the 155-day threshold since the recent low, many of which were accumulated at prices above $95k.
This suggests a degree of confidence has returned, and accumulation pressures are outweighing the propensity for investors to spend and de-risk. This also provides confluence to the notion that the price range is no longer an attractive region for these investors to take profit in.
Live Chart
Having established that the LTH cohort is expressing a preference to hold onto their supply, we can attempt to quantify the potential price levels required to entice them to part with their coins, and commence the next wave of profit taking.
Historically speaking, the Long-Term Holder cohort typically ramps up their spending pressure when the average member is holding a +350% unrealized profit margin. Reconciling this information with the spot price, the average LTH is expected to hit a 350% profit margin at the $99.9k level.
As such, we can anticipate an uptick in sell-side pressure as the market approaches this zone, making it an area that will likely require substantial buy-side demand to absorb the distribution, and sustain upwards momentum.
Live Chart
Additionally, a significant concentration of coins remain held at a loss within this $95k to $98k region. As the market approaches this zone, some investors may opt to exit at or near their break-even price, introducing additional sell-side resistance. This would compound the expected increase in LTH distribution, creating an important resistance level to keep an eye on.
The region above $100k has a relatively small volume of coins with a cost basis in that the area. If the market can successfully navigate the sell-side pressure within the $95k to $98k corridor, it may enter a region with minimal resistance, paving the way for a run back towards price discovery, and a new ATH.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
Following a surge in price over the last two weeks, Bitcoin‚Äôs price momentum is encountering its first meaningful wave of resistance. Crucially, price has broken above three critical levels: the Short-Term Holder cost-basis, the 111-Day Moving Average, and the $109K range low from the all-time high formation.
These levels represent a critical inflection point that must be upheld. Failure to stabilize above these levels would push the price back into the consolidation range, and return many investors to a state of meaningful unrealized loss.
Under the surface, a structural reset across many sectors of the Bitcoin economy has taken place, indicating that much of the speculative excess has been flushed out. However, investor profit and loss taking remains light, whilst Long-Term Holders remain largely inactive in the market. This creates a delicate market environment, with latent volatility and a vulnerability to shocks in either direction."

With the BTC price climbing to a high of $97.9k, the renewed market strength has sparked a wave of capital inflows, with the realized cap climbing to an ATH value of $889B.
The rebound in price has provided significant financial relief to market participants. At the recent low of $74k, over +5M BTC were held in an underwater position. This has collapsed to just +2M BTC, with over +3M BTC having returned to a state of profit.
Demand from institutional investors across recent months has been lackluster, with the ETF complex experiencing its largest period of sustained outflows on record. This has markedly reversed in the wake of the recent market strength, with the ETFs recording over +$4.6B of inflows across the last two weeks.
The market remains at a critical decision point, hovering just above the Short-Term Holder cost-basis. Additionally, a large cluster of coins resides around the spot price. Historically, this had led to increased market sensitivity and, by extension, elevated volatility potential.
A broad-based contraction in volatility premium across all contract maturities is occurring, indicates that volatility expectations are quite subdued, reinforcing the view that the market may be undervaluing future volatility.

Liquidity Rises
Last week, the Bitcoin market experienced a sharp rally, with the BTC price climbing to a high of $97.9k, its highest in over two months. Since then, it has pulled back slightly to trade at around $94.0k, before rallying back to $97.0k.
This market strength has sparked a renewed wave of capital inflows, and an uptick in liquidity flowing into Bitcoin. We can also see some investors opting to de-risk and take profit, distributing into the upward momentum.
One way we can quantify the change in network liquidity is via the realized cap metric, which calculates the cumulative net capital flows into a digital asset. The Bitcoin realized cap is now trading at an ATH value of $889B. The rate of capital growth has seen the realized cap increase by +2.1% over the last month.
Live Chart
The Net Realized Profit/Loss metric is calculated as the first derivative of the Realized Cap, allowing us to observe the magnitude of net USD denominated capital flows occurring each day.
A surge in profit taking can be observed in recent weeks, with the recent rally drawing in over $1B/day in net capital inflows. This points to initial indicators of a return of demand-side strength, allowing sellers to lock in profits, and speaking to buyers willing to pick up coins at the current market price. Generally speaking, this points to a wave of demand which is absorbing the incoming supply.
Notably, the market has sustained a profit-driven regime since October 2023, with capital inflows consistently exceeding outflows. This steady influx of fresh capital serves as an overall constructive signal.
Live Chart
If we combine both Realized Profit and Loss taking volumes on-chain, we can better gauge the willingness of investors to transact within the current market conditions.
Combined profit and loss volumes have risen to a value of $1B/day, with only 15% of trading days this cycle recording a larger value. This suggests an increase in investor activity and demand.
Of note, the component of Realized Loss accounts for only 1-2% of the total, suggesting the majority of investors with coins acquired above $96k are sitting tight for the time being.
Live Chart
Financial Pressure Eases
We have established that there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime. We can now turn towards evaluating the degree of financial relief which the price bounce has provided to market participants.
As the market approached the current local low of $74k, more than 5M BTC were held in an underwater position. However, as the market recovery has taken place, this number has fallen to around 1.9M BTC, indicating that over 3M BTC have returned to a state of profit. This generally works towards bolstering investor sentiment.
We flagged a similar occurrence in the previous
WoC edition
, showing that a significant number of Short-Term Holder coins had returned to a profitable position as the market rallied back above $95k. It is likely that this cohort will be a key driver of the aforementioned profit taking events, as local dip buyers take profits into market strength.
Live Chart
If we inspect the breakdown of coins held in in loss between Long and Short-Term Holders, we can see that the STH cohort still represent the lions share of underwater positions (83% of Long and Short-Term Holder losses).
With the majority of the financial burden placed upon the shoulders of recent buyers, the next phase of our our analysis will focus in on this cohort as the primary indicator for how sentiment has shifted as the market attempts to recover.
Live Chart
A powerful tool for assessing investor stress is the unrealized loss metric, which reflects the dollar value of paper losses held by investors. Applying this to the Short-Term Holder cohort, we can see two significant periods of elevated stress amongst the new investors:
The Yen-Carry-Trade unwind in August 2024, which saw STH Relative Unrealized Losses surge above the +2œÉ band.
The market downturn in 2025 placed investors into a similar degree of financial stress, with relative unrealized losses surging back above the +2œÉ. band.
By this measure, this rally has made for a substantial improvement to the portfolio value of new investors, with unrealized losses collapsing from a value above the +2œÉ band, back towards neutral values.
Live Chart
This improvement in these investors portfolios is directly transferring into their spending behavior. The metric below shows the dominance between STH volume spent in profit and in loss, which shows a sharp transition out of the loss-driven regime of just a few weeks ago.
This can potentially be considered as a sort of pivot point, signalling that a critical mass of Short-Term Holder supply has just returned to a state of profit.
Live Chart
ETF Inflows Intensify
As the BTC price languished during recent months, demand from institutional investors appeared to slow down as well. The ETF complex saw the largest period of sustained outflows on record, with around 70k BTC in net outflows. However, the recent price rebound has sparked renewed confidence amongst these investors, with more than $4.6B flowing into the ETFs over the last two weeks alone.
Strong ETF inflows, alongside improved investor confidence helps to paint a picture of stronger tailwinds supporting the Bitcoin market.
Live Chart
The total AUM held within the US spot ETFs has now climbed to over 1.171M BTC, which is just 11k BTC shy of the 1.182M BTC ATH. The recent wave of inflows has now largely offset the period of outflows we mentioned before, which is another healthy signal for Bitcoin demand.
Live Chart
Volatility Brewing
As mentioned in the
prior WoC edition
, the 111DMA and the Short-Term Holder cost-basis are two critical levels to hold in order for the market to sustain positive price momentum. The recent rally managed to clear both of these price levels, and has since pulled-back to retest demand in that region.
On the daily time-frame, the price has set a higher high, and the market is now attempting to consolidate at these key levels. It is key to hold above these models, as a break back below would bring the recent positive market momentum back into question.
Live Chart
With the market positioned at a critical decision point, assessing volatility expectations becomes an important factor.
The Realized Supply Density is a useful tool for evaluating the concentration of supply with a cost basis close to the current spot price. Whenever this metric reached high levels, it means a dense cluster of coins have a cost basis close to the price. In such circumstances, small price movements can have an out-sized impact on a broad base of investors. This tends to heighten market sensitivity and by extension, leads to elevated volatility potential.
The Realized Supply Density metric has increased significantly during this rally, which is an interesting phenomena. Generally speaking, we see this metric rise during periods of lengthy consolidation, as more coins change hands in a narrow price range.
In this instance, the rally has actually moved the market back towards an existing supply cluster centred around $95k. These coins were accumulated between December 2024 and February 2025, and have remained held throughout the recent drawdown.
It could be argued that these investors are the most likely ones to de-risk, and sell as close to their cost basis as possible if recent market conditions have concerned them.
Live Chart
Shifting over to the options domain, we can see that 1-week and 1-month at-the-market implied volatility are falling sharply. Both contract maturities are seeing their IV at their lowest values since July 2024, suggesting options traders are not pricing in expectations for an elevated volatility regime.
Historically, very low IV regimes tend to precede a period of heightened realized volatility, serving as a valuable counter-indicator.
Live Chart
A similar pattern is seen for longer-dated contracts, with implied volatility premiums for both 3-month and 6-month maturities compressing steadily since the March 2024 all-time high. This broad-based contraction in volatility premium indicates that volatility expectations are quite subdued, reinforcing the view that the market may be undervaluing future volatility.
Live Chart
We can see the gradual compression of volatility premiums via the IV term structure, which illustrates the changes in implied volatility priced into the market over the last two weeks. This shows the contraction in IV across all contracts, with the most pronounced declines occurring in May-dated contracts.
Interestingly, options expiring as far out as March 2026 are currently priced with a volatility premium just above 50%, which is a historically low level. This perhaps reflects the maturation of Bitcoin over time, and the 2023-25 cycle has certainly seen Bitcoin trade in a much lower volatility regime compared to past cycles.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The recent strength in the Bitcoin price has returned more than +3M BTC into a position of profit, significantly easing the financial stress that had been mounting among investors since the market decline from the Dec-2024 ATH. This rebound has sparked an uptick in fresh capital inflows, and has seen the Realized Cap expanding by 2% over the last month.
The AUM held within the US spot ETFs have seen over $4.5B in inflows over the last two weeks, offsetting the majority of the outflows which occurred in March and April. Volatility premiums are compressed in options markets, and there are several on-chain indicators suggesting the market is at a critical decision point, and volatility may be under-priced as a result."
2025,19,2025-W19,2025-05-05,2025-05-11,Bullish,94733.99,104137.62,100547.25,9.93,Agree,"Executive Summary
Bitcoin has rallied from $35k to a new local high of $104k, supported by substantial accumulation, visible in on-chain volumes.
In particular, significant coin volumes appear to have changed hands in the $93k 95k range, which now acts as a key level for short-term support.
Off-chain spot flows also turned positive, with Coinbase seeing intense net buying pressure, and Binance sell-pressure cooling off. This indicates ‚Äòbuy-the-dip‚Äô behaviour remains dominant across the two major exchanges.
ETF inflows peaked at $389M/day on 25-April, helping to fuel the rally, but have since slowed to a more modest $58M/day.
Perpetual markets appear to lag behind spot markets, as open interest contracts were due to a short squeeze, which liquidated many accounts that were betting against the move higher.

.
Strong Spot Demand
Since the $75k price low was set on 9-April, Bitcoin markets are experiencing a strong spot-driven rally, with noticeable sideways accumulation phases between each move higher.
We can see this stair-stepping pattern in the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap, which presents supply clusters accumulated at similar price levels over the last three months.
From this, we can see the accumulation regimes formed before each leg higher, culminating in the latest move to $ 104k.
Live Dashboard
Focusing on the last 30 days, we can also see that a key accumulation zone emerged between $93k and $95k. This range aligns closely with the Short-Term Holder cost basis, representing investors who entered the market within the past 155 days.
As a result, this zone is likely to act as a strong support level in the event of any short-term market pullback, representing a demand zone where investors are likely to see value once again.
Live Dashboard
A Positive Bias in Spot Flows
In addition to these on-chain signals, off-chain order flow metrics offer valuable insights into market sentiment and bias. One such indicator is the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which tracks the net taker-side buy or sell pressure in spot order books. We can evaluate the strength and directional bias within spot markets by examining this metric across major trading venues.
The chart below highlights the spot CVD metric for Binance and Coinbase. Since mid-April, Coinbase has experienced a regime of consistent net buying, with CVD peaking at +$45M per day, aligning with the acceleration of the market higher. In contrast, Binance markets have transitioned from an intense net selling pressure of -$71M per day in mid-March, to a milder -$9M daily today, reflecting a notable cool-down in sell-side pressure.
The consistency between on-chain accumulation and off-chain spot demand helps establish that the rally to $104k was supported by genuine dip buying activity. This confluence of buyer strength across both dimensions would ideally remain in play to sustain a mid-term bullish outlook.
Live Chart
Gauging Institutional Interest
Traditional investor participation has grown in the Bitcoin market, especially since the launch of the spot ETFs. Monitoring these products‚Äô flows in and out can offer a valuable lens into institutional sentiment, conviction, and demand. Notably, the weekly average net inflow to ETF wallets peaked at $389M/day on 25-April, coinciding with the surge in spot-driven buying, and supporting the rally toward $104k. ETF inflows have since cooled off to around $58M/day.
These ETF flows show that institutional interest in Bitcoin remains relatively robust, with inflows being of a similar magnitude to those seen during previous market rallies in 2024.
Live Chart
Approaching The Highs
With Bitcoin now trading just below its all-time high of $109k, signs of excitement are beginning to re-emerge in the market. One of the most responsive tools to track this transition is the Short-Term Holder (STH) Supply in Profit/Loss Ratio, which captures the shift in sentiment amongst active investors.
This metric was particularly insightful during the correction on 7-April, when it sank to 0.03, indicating that nearly all STH-held supply was now underwater. This level was hit as the market tagged the $76k low, and since then, the ratio has surged above the critical threshold level of 9.0, meaning more than 90% of STH supply is now back in profit.
Generally speaking, high values can align with higher-risk market conditions, as investors start to take profit. These conditions can persist for some time, but they often precede profit-taking phases or a local top‚Äôs formation if fresh demand inflows slow down.
So long as this ratio remains well above the equilibrium level of 1.0, bullish momentum tends to stay intact. However, any sustained drop below this level would signal a meaningful shift in market strength and possible trend exhaustion.
Live Chart
Profit-Taking Begins, But With Room to Run
With short-term holders (STHs) now sitting on unrealized gains, it's natural to expect an uptick in profit-taking activity. Monitoring this cohort‚Äôs behavior rallies is key to identifying when demand exhaustion may be approaching around a potential local top.
Recently, the magnitude of STH Realized Profit has surged to almost +3 standard deviations above its 90-day average, reflecting a notable uptick in profit realization. In past cycles, particularly during rallies towards the ATH, this metric has historically climbed to over +5 standard deviations or more. This signals that much stronger profit-taking pressure is often required to overwhelm the inflow of demand.
Live Chart
Derivatives Markets Lag Behind
While spot market strength can be linked to the recent rally, traders in derivatives markets have taken longer to adjust. One of the more effective tools for gauging sentiment in this arena is the open interest (OI) in perpetual futures markets, denominated in BTC. Tracking the weekly change in OI across major platforms provides insights into whether speculators were expecting, or surprised by, market moves.
Since January 2025, this metric has shown its utility in identifying points where investors were surprised by the move, often being squeezed out of their positions. During the price drop below $80k, the market experienced multiple OI contractions of more than 10% per week. This is a clear sign that over-leveraged long positions were being forcefully closed as prices approached their liquidation levels.
Interestingly, a similar dynamic has unfolded during the recent rally above $90k, with a similar contraction in OI, except this time signalling a short-side squeeze. These types of shakeouts are characteristic of healthy resets in derivative positioning and are often seen during the early phases of a new market trend. The presence of such squeezes suggests that the rally has purged excessive leverage, laying the groundwork for a more robust uptrend.
Live Chart
As leveraged short positions were flushed out, futures open interest has declined by -10%, dropping from 370k BTC to 336k BTC. This reduction gives us a sense of scale for how large the short squeeze was. This process also lessens the probability of an unhealthy deleveraging event, and likely softens the potential for volatility in near-term price action.

The relatively light long positioning in the perpetual futures market is another key signal of derivatives playing catch-up with spot market momentum. The funding rate for major exchanges is one of the most effective tools to gauge the directional bias in these markets, and for the last few weeks, it has been remarkably neutral, despite the bullish market impulse.
As shown in the chart below, mean and individual funding rates have been steadily recovering since late April, currently hovering around 0.007% (7.6% per year). This uptick reflects a constructive shift, suggesting the appetite for long exposure in the perpetual markets is not excessive. There appears to be limited long-side leverage in the market at this stage, which is a healthy sign.
Live Chart
Options Are Warming Up
A complementary lens into market sentiment can be found in options market data, specifically through the 1-Month 25 Delta Skew. This metric is calculated as the implied volatility (IV) of 25-delta puts minus the IV of 25-delta calls. A negative skew, therefore, indicates that calls are more expensive than puts, suggesting that traders are speculating more aggressively on upside movement, often a sign of underlying bullish sentiment.
Currently, the 25 Delta Skew (1M) has dropped to -6.1%, meaning IV for calls is materially higher than for puts. This reflects a notable shift toward risk-on behavior, as options traders lean into bullish speculation rather than hedging against downside risk.
While not a definitive signal on its own, a sustained negative skew, particularly after a strong move higher, often aligns with rising market optimism. For the options market to remain in sync with bullish spot dynamics, we'd want to see this skew remain below or around neutral, reinforcing confidence in the rally‚Äôs strength.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs rally back towards all-time highs has been largely spot-driven, underpinned by strong on-chain accumulation and supportive off-chain flows. Demand appears to be primarily via spot ETFs, and major spot exchanges like Coinbase. The emergence of a key cost basis support zone around $95k, and a cooling off of sell-side pressure further reinforces the strength of this uptrend.
The derivatives markets, however, appear to be playing catch-up, with open interest and funding rates yet to fully align with the upwards momentum in spot markets. Options market positioning reflects a cautious but optimistic outlook, whilst there are few signs of excessive long leverage in futures markets at this time."

Financial Relief
The digital asset ecosystem has continued to show strength in recent weeks, led by Bitcoin, which has reached a local high of $107k, and is now just a stone's throw away from the $109k ATH. The market has encountered its meaningful resistance between $102k and $105k, where it has been consolidating for the last two weeks.
Live Chart
To date, only 4 trading days have ever recorded a higher daily closing Bitcoin price, and the last weekly close of $106.5k is the highest in history. Bitcoin is also trading approximately 40% higher over the last six weeks, highlighting how strong the market recovery has been.
Live Chart
When the market recovers quickly from a drawdown, we can track the 30-day change in the proportion of supply held in profit across various cohorts. This helps us identify which investor groups have benefited from the recovery and can illustrate major shifts in sentiment.
The recent price rise has provided significant financial relief to the Short-Term Holder cohort in particular, with their percentage of supply in profit increasing by +71% over the last month. This marks the second-largest positive uptick in profitability for this cohort on record.
Live Chart
Another tool we can use to gauge improvements to investor profitability is by inspecting changes in each cohort‚Äôs MVRV Ratio since the local $74k price low.
MVRV has increased from 1.74 to 2.33 (+74% to +133% unrealized gain)
STH MVRV increased from 0.82 to 1.13 (-18% unrealized loss to +13% unrealized gain)
LTH MVRV increased from 2.91 to 3.30 (+191% to +230% unrealized gain)
Notably, for all of these cohorts, investors have experienced a marked improvement in their financial position. This likely has the knock-on effect of boosting investor confidence and sentiment.
Live Chart
As market conditions improve and investor portfolios recover, many are taking the opportunity to lock in profits. Profit taking in a bull market can be thought of as the opposite side of fresh demand, which is absorbing this supply.
One way to quantify shifts in this supply and demand balance is via the Realized Cap metric, which aggregates the cumulative net capital inflows into a digital asset. Over the past month, the total value stored in the Bitcoin network has grown by +4.2%, reflecting a meaningful uptick in capital entering the market.
This has pushed the Realized Cap to a new ATH, and over $900B for the first time, a significant milestone that underscores the immense value investors have stored within the leading digital asset.
Live Chart
With a $1T milestone for the Realized Cap on the horizon, we can track how capital flows have accrued in the Bitcoin network over its 16-year history. The chart below illustrates the duration between each log-scale milestone that the realized cap has surpassed over time:
$1M: February 2011
$10M: May 2011
$100M: February 2013
$1B: November 2013
$10B: May 2017
$100B: August 2019
Between 2011 and 2013, the realized cap moved from $1M to over $1B, clearing four logarithmic milestones over a 2-year time horizon. Bitcoin was a far smaller asset than it is today, and experienced exponential growth during the network's initial bootstrapping phase. The next major milestone of $10B required three and a half years before the Realized Cap hit $10B in mid-2017.
The last logarithmic milestone of $100B was reached nearly 6 years ago in August 2019. This is the longest interval between logarithmic milestones, showing how the appreciation and growth of the asset has slowed over time, requiring longer periods of time, and increasingly large volumes of capital required before it can cross the $1T threshold.
Live Chart
Short-Term Holder Profit Taking
Following one of the sharpest improvements in Short-Term Holder profitability on record, it is likely that many recent dip buyers will switch into profit-taking, to capitalize on market strength.
As the price accelerated towards the
Short-Term Holder cost-basis of $93k
, and then decisively broke above it, we can see a substantial uptick in profit-taking activity, peaking at $747M/day.
Over the last 30 days, we have seen a total of $11.4B in cumulative realized profit by Short-Term Holders. For comparison, over the previous 30-day period, only $1.2B of profit was realized, underscoring how drastic the rebound in new investor sentiment and spending behaviour has been.
Live Chart
This shift has caused a major spike in the Short-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. Realized profit volumes for Short-Term Holders now massively outweigh realized losses, such that only 8% of trading days have seen the P/L Ratio at a higher level.
Historically, values this elevated are typical during strong bullish impulses, but also tend to occur as the market rallies towards local and global topping formations. Excessive profit taking can overwhelm the inflow of new demand, resulting in an excess of overhead supply acting as resistance.
Live Chart
We can complement this analysis by utilizing the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which is a powerful tool assessing how, at equilibrium, the market is viewed from the perspective of existing holders. We can consider this metric under the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors spend coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.
Low values
indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‚Äòprofit and loss‚Äô within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.
For the Short-Term Holder cohort, we can see a sharp uptick in their Sell-Side Risk Ratio, although it remains significantly below levels often seen around major peaks. This suggests there may still be room for the market rally to continue, as investors are not yet locking in excessive profits relative to their total holdings.
Live Chart
Ethereum Surges on Pectra Upgrade
Ethereum is the second-largest digital asset and has faced challenging market conditions in recent years. The ETH price has fallen short of many investors' expectations since 2023, and has thus far not set a new ATH in this cycle.
However, the ETH price has experienced a major price surge in recent weeks, potentially driven by excitement around the successful Pectra upgrade on May 7th. The Pectra upgrade aims to consolidate the validator set and enhance overall network efficiency.
The Ethereum price has rallied from $1,800 to a new local high of $2,700, a +50% increase in a few weeks, offering significant financial relief to investors.
The recent rally included several daily price gains exceeding +1œÉ moves, with the most significant being a +21.8% surge, the strongest one-day increase since May 2021.
Live Chart
The divergence in performance between the two leading digital assets this cycle is reflected in the ETH/BTC ratio, which has been in a sustained downtrend since the 2022 Merge event. It recently bottomed at 0.018, the lowest level since January 2020.
Ethereum‚Äôs recent outperformance has resulted in a resurgence of the ETH/BTC Ratio, with the ratio accelerating to a value of 0.026, an increase of 14.5%, the 46th largest event on record.
Live Chart
Of interest, this price rally has decisively broken above the Realized Price, which is trading at $1,900. This indicates the average holder of ETH is now back in an unrealized profit, providing meaningful financial relief for many holders.
The Active Realized Price and True Market Mean are two alternative onchain valuation models which often trade near the midpoint of Ethereum market cycles. These metrics estimate the cost basis of active market participants and discount lost coins and long-dormant supply. This results in a more accurate read of the cost basis for economically active investors.
True Market Mean: $2,400
Active Realized Price: $2,900
Encouragingly, price has also moved above the True Market Mean, underscoring the strength of this upwards price move. However, the Active Realized Price still sits overhead and remains a key level that must be decisively reclaimed to support continued improvement in Ethereum investor confidence.
Live Chart
We can find confluence when examining Ethereum‚Äôs Cost-Basis Distribution profile. Presently, there is a significant concentration of investor cost basis levels around the $2,800 level. This region is likely to attract increased sell-side pressure, as many investors who were previously underwater may look to de-risk at, or near, their breakeven level, and take some chips off the table.
Live Dashboard
Summary and Conclusion
Strength in the digital asset market remains robust, with Bitcoin continuing to consolidate just beneath its ATH of $109k. The elevation in price has raised the profitability of the vast majority of market investors, with many seizing the opportunity to lock in profits. As a result, capital inflows have increased markedly, pushing the Realized Cap above $900B for the first time, a historic milestone that underscores the depth of liquidity in the market.
For the Short-Term Holders, the improvement in their portfolio values has directly translated into a notable increase in spending activity, with the cohort realizing over $11.4B of profit across the last month.
Ethereum has shown a strong response following the Pectra upgrade, with its spot price rallying from $1,800 to a high of $2,700. This recovery has returned the average ETH holder to a position of unrealized profit, offering meaningful financial relief. Notably, the $2,400‚Äì$2,900 range remains a key zone of interest, serving as both a resistance band and a potential breakout region critical for sustaining further upward momentum."
2025,21,2025-W21,2025-05-19,2025-05-25,Bullish,105616.18,109048.68,108299.11,3.25,Agree,"Executive Summary
Strength in the Bitcoin market persists, with the leading digital asset reaching a new ATH of $111k, and setting the third fresh ATH of this cycle.
Investor profitability and spending behavior have both increased notably, and current levels remain below the extremes reached at prior bull market peaks.
Exchange related interactions have risen substantially, with around 33% of total Bitcoin on-chain volume now passing through centralized trading venues.
Activity is also increasing in the derivatives sector, where both futures and options markets are experiencing significant growth in open interest.
In the event of further upside, the $120k level appears as a key zone of interest, with sell-side pressure expected to accelerate in and around this zone based on on-chain price models intersected in prior cycles.

Bitcoin Breaks to New ATHs
Strength in the Bitcoin market remains firm, with the leading digital asset reaching a new all-time high of $111k, marking the third major ATH break of this cycle. Historically, price discovery phases are often followed by brief sell-offs, as early profit-takers seize the opportunity to exit and de-risk at new highs.
Bitcoin has thus far followed this pattern, with the price pulling back to $107k shortly after the initial breakout, before recovering to consolidate around the $108k level for the rest of the week.
Bitcoin is outperforming most asset classes amidst an environment of challenging macro economic conditions, and geopolitical tensions, making the broader outlook remarkably uncertain. This robust performance is a truly fascinating signal amidst relatively challenging market conditions.
Live Chart
When we compare the price performances of the current cycle, to prior ones, we can see a surprising similarity in structure, despite Bitcoin being orders of magnitude larger in total Market Cap size. The chart below presents the index performance since the relative cycle low:
2015-2018 Cycle: +1076%
2018-2022 Cycle: +1007%
2022+ Cycle: +656%
It is a remarkable feat for Bitcoin to be tracking so closely to previous cycles when accounting for the significantly larger market capitalization today. This suggests that the scale of demand for Bitcoin is keeping pace with the growth rate of the asset.
Live Chart
We can assess the accumulation patterns across various wallet sizes, and can see that new ATH tends to inspire a meaningful uptick in accumulation. This drives the Accumulation Trend Score up towards its highest value of 1.0.
Notably, elevated accumulation pressure has been observed during both the $70k, and $107k ATHs set in March, and November 2024. This underscores the tendency for investors to buy heavily when the market enters price discovery, but also the propensity for existing holders to take profit at higher prices. This ""herd mentality"" highlights market participants converging around key psychological levels and events, such as ATH break-outs.
In contrast, last cycle‚Äôs $69k ATH set in November 2021 saw strong accumulation pressure into, and long after the peak price was established. This ultimately marked the cyclical top, and preceded a prolonged bear market in 2022. While robust accumulation is generally a constructive signal, it is important to recognize that overwhelming consensus behavior is not always a reliable indicator of future direction (and can in fact be a contrarian one).
Live Chart
Profits Heating Up
As the market re-enters a period of price discovery, the unrealized profit held by market participants has surged higher. As investor profitability grows, we usually expect an uptick in sell-side pressure in response. As the price rises, larger volumes of buy-side demand are required to absorb the distributed coins in order for the market to sustain upwards momentum.
The Relative Unrealized Profit metric serves as a valuable tool to gauge the magnitude of paper profits held across the market. Currently, this metric is breaking above its +2œÉ band
,
a level that has historically aligned with the market entering a euphoric phase. These environments are usually characterized by heightened volatility, and tend to be brief in duration, with only 16% of all trading days seeing paper profits above this level.
Live Chart
In response to these extremely profitable conditions, there has been a distinct increase in profit taking activity, which can be observed via the Volatility-Adjusted Net Realized Profit/Loss metric.
This metric measures realized profit and loss in BTC terms which normalizes it relative to Bitcoin‚Äôs growing market cap across cycles. It is further refined by adjusting for 7-day realized volatility, to account for Bitcoin‚Äôs diminishing returns and slower growth rate as the asset matures.
As price rallied through the previous ATH, a notable uptick in profit-taking was recorded, with only 14.4% of days recording higher values. This suggests profit-taking has increased, but has not yet reached extreme levels.
Live Chart
This observation is also reflected in the SOPR metric, which assesses the average profit or loss multiple locked in by investors who are spending coins on-chain. The recent ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit. Fewer than 8% of trading days have been more profitable for investors, suggesting a meaningful transition into profit taking activity is underway. However, we are yet to reach the truly euphoric heights seen during prior major price topping formations.
Live Chart
Exchange Activity Increases
Centralized exchanges remain the primary venue for trade and speculation, with $4B-$8B flowing in and out on any given day. The volume of deposits and withdrawals to exchanges can be compared to the total volume settled on-chain, providing a tool for assessing the appetite of investors to trade Bitcoin.
This Exchange Volume Dominance metric has been on the rise since the $109k ATH set in early 2025, and has continued to climb as the market rallied. Around 33% of all volume transacted on the Bitcoin network is currently interacting with centralized exchanges.
This marks a notable uptick in investor demand and trading activity, aligned with the market entering a new phase of price discovery.
Live Chart
By combining on-chain pricestamping of coins, with Glassnode‚Äôs labels for centralized exchange addresses, we can estimate the average profit or loss for coins which are deposited to exchanges. This provides more granular insight into investor sentiment and spending behavior directly associated with exchange activity.
The average coin deposited to exchanges is currently realizing a profit of approximately +$9.3k, while coins moving at a loss are realizing an average loss of just -$780. This divergence indicates that the current spending behavior is overwhelmingly profit-driven, reflecting a notable improvement in investor sentiment.
Live Chart
This places the average profit at 12x larger than losses, which is pushing the ratio between the two near the extremes often seen in the most energetic stages of prior bull markets. The extreme level of this Exchange Mean Profit/Loss Ratio provides an additional layer of confluence that we are entering the euphoric phase of the bull market.
Live Chart
Derivatives Lever Up
With activity rising on centralized exchanges, it becomes increasingly important to examine the derivatives landscape as well, offering insight into the build up of leverage which often accompanies bullish environments.
Open interest for futures contracts has seen marked growth since the $74k local low in April, expanding from $36.8B, to a current value of $55.6B. This reflects a +$19B increase (+51%) over the last 49 days alone, suggesting a build up of leverage is underway.
Live Chart
In parallel, open interest in options contracts has surged from $20.4B to $46.2B, a new all-time high. This +$25.8B increase is notably larger than the open interest growth observed in the futures market.
The rapid expansion of options open interest reflects a maturing investor base which is increasingly employing option contracts to execute more sophisticated strategies to fine-tune their risk management and trading positions.
Live Chart
ETF Inflows Remain Strong
Moving towards the spot ETFs, we can see a sustained period of buy-side pressure originated in late April, and remains strong today. The ETFs have experienced inflows of more than $300M/day for the past week.
This large and sustained buy-side pressure from both retail and institutional investors suggests a continued confidence in the asset, and has been a meaningful tailwind for the market supporting all previous ATH breaks since they went live in 2024.
Live Chart
Navigating Price Discovery
With the Bitcoin price returning to price discovery, we can turn to a combination of on-chain and technical indicators to evaluate market momentum, and identify potential signs of overheating.
The 111DMA and 200DMA are widely used technical metrics for evaluating the momentum and trend strength of the Bitcoin market. We can complement these technical price models with the Short-Term Holder cost-basis, an on-chain metric which reflects the average acquisition price for new investors in the market. Historically, this level has served as a key threshold, often delineating between local bull and bear market regimes.
111DMA: $91.8k
200DMA: $94.3k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis: $95.9k
Currently, the price is trading well above all three key levels, underscoring the strength of the market rally since April. Notably, these pricing levels are closely aligned in value, and this convergence provides strong confluence around a critical support zone, one that will be important to hold in order to sustain further upside momentum.
Live Chart
Additionally, we can utilize the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands that highlight extreme deviations from the average investor cost basis. This helps to identify periods where investor profitability is very high relative to the long-term average. Historically, breakouts above the +1œÉ band have aligned with longer-term macro topping formations.
Realized Price +0.5œÉ: $100.2k
Realized Price +1œÉ: $119.4k
Presently, the Bitcoin price is consolidating between the +1œÉ and +0.5œÉ range. This suggests the market is relatively heated, but arguably still has room for further expansion before the unrealized profit held by investors reaches an extreme level above +1œÉ. Generally, these extreme levels inspire a widespread rush of profit taking activity, creating a major increase in sell-side pressure.
Live Chart
Finally, we can utilize the +0.5œÉ and +1œÉ standard deviation bands around the Short-Term Holder cost-basis to assess for locally overheated conditions.
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis +0.5œÉ: $120.3k
Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis +1œÉ: $135.7k
Historically, price has traded between these two bands for 467 days, and above the +1œÉ level for 484 days, accounting for just 17.5% of Bitcoins trading history. This makes entry into this range a relatively uncommon occurrence, often acting as an upper bound for local price action.
While the MVRV +1œÉ level is typically associated with macro tops, the STH-CB +0.5œÉ and +1œÉ bands are more indicative of local topping formations. Together, the combination of these models can provide a robust framework for identifying overheated market conditions.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $111K, setting the third fresh ATH of this cycle. This milestone has triggered a broad uptick in activity across all major segments of the market, evidenced by rising investor profitability and profit taking, heightened exchange interaction, notable growth in futures and options open interest, and sustained buy-side demand from spot ETFs.
As the market moves into a phase of price discovery, the $120k level appears as a key zone of interest, with sell-side pressure expected to accelerate in and around this zone."

With key support at $103.7k and $95.6k, and signs of older investors offloading, the bulls now face a critical test of their resolve.
Executive Summary
BTC reached a new all-time high at $111.8k, but quickly retraced to $103.2k. The initial rally appears to be spot-driven, with major accumulation zones at $81‚Äì85k, $93‚Äì96k, and $102‚Äì104k now acting as potential support.
Zooming out with the CBD Heatmap, many historical accumulation zones flipped into distribution zones. Sellers from $25k‚Äì31k, $38k‚Äì44k, and $60k‚Äì73k ranges are now weighing on price action.
Cost basis quantiles and short-term holder bands place immediate support near $103.7k and $95.6k, with resistance at $114.8k. These levels are statistically significant markers of broader sentiment shifts.
Realized profits spiked to $1.47B/day, marking the fifth major profit-taking wave in this cycle. Selling was led by long-term holders, not short-term traders.
Cohorts holding for >12 months dominated the recent realized profits, reflecting mature capital rotation. This aligns with earlier observations from the CBD Heatmap, confirming that seasoned investors are shaping the current top formation phase.

Mapping the Rungs of the Rally
Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin extended its rally to a new high of $111.8k, briefly surpassing the previous ATH set in January 2025. However, this move was followed by a correction to $103.2k, signalling a potential pause in bullish momentum.
To understand the anatomy of this rally, we turn to the Cumulative Volume Delta (CBD) Heatmap, a tool that tracks the net difference between aggressive buying and selling across price levels. Visually, it reveals zones of concentrated spot-driven accumulation or distribution, helping pinpoint where demand was strongest.
From the heatmap, it's evident this rally was largely spot-led and stair-stepped higher, with clear accumulation clusters at $81‚Äì85k, $93‚Äì96k, and $102‚Äì104k. These zones now potentially can serve as supply-dense regions that may act as short-term support, depending on broader market sentiment.
Notably, top buyers from Q1 2025, who held through the drawdown below $80k, are once again being tested as price churns sideways. This edition will examine the fading momentum behind recent demand, the forces draining market strength, and where potential support may emerge if weakness continues.
Live Dashboard
Old Hands Sell Pressure
To understand the forces driving Bitcoin‚Äôs recent move beyond $111k, we need to take a broader view of the market structure. By examining the CBD Heatmap from the June 2022 cycle bottom onward, a clear pattern of distribution by past accumulators begins to emerge.
As the price marched upward, the supply-dense zones that previously acted as bases of accumulation, often marked by sideways consolidation, have now turned into active selling zones. Visually, the heatmap reveals a gradual shift; areas that once supported the rally have flipped into sources of resistance, as earlier holders take the opportunity to offload.
The most notable selling pressure has come from cohorts who accumulated during key historical ranges: $25k‚Äì31k and $60k‚Äì73k. These groups, many of whom held through multiple volatility phases, are now contributing to the supply overhang that appears to be capping further upside, at least in the short term.
Live Dashboard
Navigating Price Discovery
With long-term holders gradually applying sell pressure, the probability of a short-term correction continues to build, particularly in the absence of a strong upside catalyst to push Bitcoin decisively above $111.8k. In such phases, where bullish momentum stalls, on-chain pricing models become essential tools for identifying likely support levels during pullbacks.
One particularly effective framework is the Spent Supply Distribution (SSD) Quantiles. This metric analyzes the cost basis of coins being spent at a given time, dividing them into 100 percentiles. It provides a high-resolution view of where supply originally entered the market, enabling us to pinpoint zones with elevated turnover, likely driven by profit-taking or loss realization.
Here, we focus on three key quantiles:
üî¥
0.95 (top 5% of spent supply)
üîµ
0.85 (top 15%)
üü†
0.75 (top 25%)
Historical patterns over the past five years suggest that absolute euphoria tends to occur when price trades above the 0.95 quantile, while sideways bull phases often unfold between 0.85 and 0.95. On the other hand, sustained trading below the 0.75 quantile has typically marked bearish or risk-off periods.
At present, the 0.95 quantile sits at ~$103.7k, acting as the first on-chain support zone. Should selling pressure persist, the next level to watch is the 0.85 quantile at $95.6k, which may provide structural support, or, if breached, confirm a broader risk reset.
Live Chart
With a substantial portion of Bitcoin's supply changing hands over the past six months, driven by two separate pushes to new all-time highs, it becomes increasingly important to track recent investor behaviour. One of the most insightful models for this is the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, which captures the average acquisition price of coins held for less than 155 days.
To add statistical context, we apply standard deviation bands around this cost basis to define key support and resistance zones. These bands help quantify the range of market consensus among short-term participants and can signal trend exhaustion or breakout thresholds.
Currently, the STH cost basis sits at $97.1k, representing the average entry price for recent buyers. The +1 standard deviation band, often associated with overbought or bullish breakout conditions, lies at $114.8k, while the -1 standard deviation band at $83.2k marks a level of elevated downside risk.
These three levels, $114.8k, $97.1k, and $83.2k, now define the statistical boundaries of short-term sentiment. A break above or below these thresholds will likely shape the next leg of market direction, signalling whether momentum is returning or fading.
Live Chart
A High Profit Realization
As Bitcoin retreats from its recent $111.8k high, much of the selling pressure appears to stem from intra-cycle seasoned holders, those who accumulated earlier in the rally and are now realizing substantial gains. In this phase, the profit realization regime is a key concept for evaluating the risk of demand exhaustion.
Using the 7-day SMA of daily profit realization, adjusted to exclude intra-entity flows, we see that realized profits peaked at $1.47B per day last week. This is a notable level, highlighting the intensity of recent capital rotation.
More importantly, this marks the fifth wave in this cycle where daily profit-taking has surpassed the $1B threshold. Such events often coincide with local market tops or slowdowns, especially if incoming demand cannot absorb the scale of realized gains. This puts a spotlight on the market‚Äôs resilience in the face of elevated selling pressure.
Live Chart
A Dynamic Shift
To better understand the significance of the current elevated wave of profit realization, it helps to view it through a cyclical lens. Not all profit-taking events are created equal, and the dynamic nature of these regimes can reveal how market maturity and volatility shape investor behaviour over time.
One effective approach is to examine the 90-day SMA of net realized profit, normalized by market cap. This adjustment allows us to compare profit-taking intensity across cycles on an apples-to-apples basis. A clear trend emerges: profit-taking has grown less euphoric over time, reflecting the broader degradation in cyclical upside performance and lower volatility profiles as the market matures.
From November 2015 to April 2018, the net profit-taking regime lasted ~25 months, peaking above 0.4% of market cap.
In the 2020‚Äì2022 cycle, this region persisted for ~20 months, but only peaked at around 0.15%.
In the current cycle, beginning November 2023, the net profit-taking phase has stretched across 18 months, forming two distinct peaks near 0.1%..
This trend suggests that while profit-taking still exerts significant pressure, it has become more tempered, possibly signalling a shift from boom-bust euphoria to structured capital rotation in a more mature asset class.
Live Chart
Who Is Realizing Profit?
Another useful lens for evaluating profit-taking cycles is to identify which investor cohorts are behind the selling.
Since the 2015‚Äì2018 cycle, the share of realized profit attributed to long-term holders (LTHs) has steadily increased during euphoric market tops. This trend highlights a structural shift in market maturity, where more seasoned investors dominate capital rotation rather than fast-moving speculators.
At the most recent peak, the 30-day moving average of realized profit by LTHs surged to ~$1B per day, while short-term holders (STHs) realized just $0.32B per day. This marks a more than 3X difference, reinforcing that this wave of profit-taking is being led by older, higher-conviction investors.
Live Chart
At first glance, the current ~$1B per day in realized profit by long-term holders (those holding >6 months) may seem modest compared to the $1.8B peak during the December 2024 top. However, a deeper breakdown reveals a familiar pattern.
Throughout bull markets, the 6‚Äì12 month holder cohort tends to contribute less to profit-taking as the cycle matures. This dynamic is playing out again in the current cycle. As the rally stretches, it's increasingly the older segments of long-term holders who are stepping in as dominant sellers, shaping what appears to be the top formation phase of this cycle.
Live Chart
Therefore, by excluding the 6‚Äì12 month cohort from the total realized profit of long-term holders, we can better assess the true impact of seasoned investors on current market dynamics. This adjustment removes the influence of Q1 2025 top buyers, who have relatively limited unrealized gains, and focuses on those holding for over a year with deeper profit margins.
When isolating realized profit by >12-month holders, the significance of the current wave becomes more apparent. This cohort, often associated with conviction-driven investors, is now taking profits at scale, a behaviour that typically signals maturity or exhaustion in a bull trend.
This observation is in confluence with the earlier findings from the CBD Heatmap, which also pointed to older investors contributing most of the recent selling pressure, reinforcing the narrative that long-term holders are increasingly active in this top formation phase.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs recent climb to a new all-time high of $111.8k has met growing resistance, as market data points to exhaustion from earlier buyers and profit-taking by long-standing holders. The CBD Heatmap shows that many of the strong accumulation zones from previous cycles have flipped into active selling regions, particularly among cohorts who bought in the >$25k and <$73k zones.
On-chain pricing models such as the Cost Basis Quantiles and Short-Term Holder statistical bands now define the immediate structure of the market. Key support levels at $103.7k and $95.6k will be critical to hold if demand falters, while the upper resistance band at $114.8k remains a test for renewed strength.
The profit realization regime is also showing signs of intensity, with daily profits peaking at $1.47B, primarily led by older long-term holders. This trend, along with the rising share of profit-taking from the >12-month cohort, suggests we may be witnessing a distribution phase rather than a fresh breakout.
Altogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation."
2025,23,2025-W23,2025-06-02,2025-06-08,Bullish,105904.94,105784.40,104782.54,-0.11,Disagree,"Executive Summary
After collapsing to the $101k level, demand has appeared to re-emerge at this level, with Bitcoin staging a marked recovery to $110.3k, now just $2.4k off of the ATH (-1.5%). Holding above the psychologically significant $100k mark suggests investor confidence remains robust.
Elevated prices have inspired an uptick in Long-Term Holder spending, with the cohort realizing a local peak of +$930M of profit per day. However, a unique market dynamic persists where, despite elevated profit taking, maturation pressures are overwhelming spending behavior.
Volatility expectations remain raised from the perspective of the on-chain market, with a significant cluster of coins residing within close proximity to the spot price. Additionally, options traders are pricing in a low volatility regime, suggesting that they may be underpricing the likelihood of a volatility regime shift.
The $97.6k Short-Term Holder cost basis continues to serve as a pivotal support level necessary for maintaining local bullish momentum. On the upside, the $115.4k zone emerges as the first significant resistance should the market enter price discovery.

Assessing Damage
After reaching a new all-time high of $111K, Bitcoin encountered meaningful resistance with sell-side pressure across mature investors intensifying. This resulted in price pulling back to a local low of $101K. Nevertheless, demand has appeared to re-emerged at this level, leading to a notable recovery in market strength, with price climbing to a current value of $110.3k, just $2.4k off of the ATH (-1.5%).
Live Chart
Despite the relatively shallow drawdown to $101k, sentiment across market investors took a notable hit, with the Fear and Greed Index briefly dipping into the 'Fear' category. One potential reason for this sharp shift in sentiment was investor concern over a possible double-top formation, reminiscent of the 2021 cycle.
Live Chart
When measuring the market correction as a percentage drawdown from the ATH, the correction amounted to just -9%, with 384 out of 928 trading days (41.4%) this cycle experiencing a larger drawdown. This decline also closely aligns with the cycle‚Äôs median drawdown of 7%, indicating that, from a price perspective, the severity of the contraction was broadly consistent with typical market behavior this cycle.
Live Chart
Encouragingly, the wave of fear in market sentiment did not translate into a meaningful shift in spending behavior. When assessing losses locked in on-chain, only -$200M of losses were realized, with the magnitude significantly shallower than previous correction events. This suggests that loss-taking remained contained, with investors largely unfazed by the drawdown.
Live Chart
Increasing granularity, when inspecting the composition of the loss taking transactions, the majority of losses originate from the front end of the Short-Term Holder curve, with only the newest of investors capitulating across the market correction.
24hr Loss Taking Dominance: 43%
1d-1w Loss Taking Dominance: 26%
1w-1m Loss Taking Dominance: 31%
1m-3m Loss Taking Dominance: 0%
3m-6m Loss Taking Dominance: 0%
With no losses locked in across mature investors, nearly the entirety of loss taking occurred from top buyers across the ATH formation, suggesting a capitulation of only the most speculative of investors.
Live Chart
However, a significant closure in open interest occurred across futures markets, with over -$2.3B of force closed or withdrawn contracts. This event was the 7th largest of the current cycle, highlighting the contraction as a significant de-leveraging event this cycle.
This dichotomy between the on-chain and futures market highlights that the market contraction was likely driven by activity within the futures market, with investor confidence across on-chain markets remaining robust.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holder Profit Taking
With Bitcoin trading just a stone‚Äôs throw from its ATH, it is prudent to assess the behavior of Long-Term Holders (LTHs), a cohort known to become increasingly active at market extremes. Historically, outsized distribution from this group has aligned with overheated market conditions and, at times, signaled transitions into bear market regimes.
Currently, we observe a notable uptick in LTH spending behavior, with their Net Realized Profit/Loss reaching a local peak of $930M/day. This figure rivals the $840M/day realized during the $73K ATH, yet remains well below the $1.64B/day peak seen during the initial breakout above $100K. This dynamic suggests that while LTH profit-taking is elevated, current price levels are not yet attractive enough to trigger broader-scale distribution.
Live Chart
The recent surge in profit-taking has driven the LTH Realized P/L Ratio aggressively higher, reaching a value of 9.4M, a level surpassed on only 884 / 5601 trading days (15.8%). This uptick reflects a regime where the vast majority of long-term held supply is now transacting at large scale profits, with minimal volume being transacted at a loss.
Historically, such elevated readings in this metric are consistent with periods of euphoria, which typically occur at the later stages of the bull market. Provided there is a sustained influx of new demand and liquidity, these euphoric phases can persist for several months.
Live Chart
Despite the marked increase in Long-Term Holder profit-taking and spending activity, the proportion of network wealth held by the cohort continues to rise. This dynamic highlights that maturation and accumulation pressures are outweighing distribution behavior.
Such a trend is highly atypical for late-stage bull markets, which are traditionally characterized by a decline in LTH supply as the cohort enters sustained periods of aggressive distribution. In contrast, the current cycle reflects a unique duality: elevated LTH spending volumes are occurring alongside an even greater volume of coins aging into maturity and entering the cohort.
This phenomenon introduces a new market structure, where LTH wealth appears significantly stickier than in prior cycles. A likely driver of this change is the influence of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional participation, which may be anchoring a larger portion of supply in long-term custody.
Live Chart
Volatility Builds
As the market approaches all-time highs and Long-Term Holder distribution accelerates, assessing volatility expectations becomes increasingly relevant.
The Realized Supply Density metric offers a valuable lens through which to evaluate the concentration of coin supply with a cost basis near the current spot price. Elevated values indicate a dense cluster of coins acquired at or around current prices. In such environments, even modest price fluctuations can affect a broad swath of investors, often amplifying market sensitivity and, in turn, volatility potential.
In recent weeks, this metric has seen a notable uptick, pointing to strong accumulation near the spot price. This concentration raises the probability of outsized reactions to price movements, increasing volatility risk in the near term.
Live Chart
In contrast, a view from the options market tells a different story. At-the-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) across all major tenors continues to trend lower, suggesting that options traders are not anticipating a shift to a high-volatility regime. Historically, such complacency in volatility pricing has often served as a counter-trend signal, preceding periods of heightened volatility.
Live Chart
Market Navigation
With Bitcoin continuing its upwards approach towards its ATH, whilst volatility expectations continue to uptick, we shall consult a combination of key technical and on-chain pricing levels to help navigate multiple paths for price.
With price is commonly considered as the ultimate distillation point of supply and demand, the 111DMA, the 200DMA and the 365DMA have historically served as robust momentum gauges for Bitcoin, with elevation above all three generally a constructive observation.
111DMA: $92.9k
200DMA: $95.4k
365DMA: $81.7k
From a technical standpoint, the price band between $92.9k and $95.4k appears to be a critical region to maintain in order to reinforce local momentum, while the $81.7k level serves as a potential lower bound consistent with broader bull market conditions. At present, Bitcoin is recording a substantial deviation above these levels, indicating notable market strength.
Live Chart
Shifting focus to key on-chain pricing levels, the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, representing the average acquisition price for newer market participants, has historically served as a pivotal threshold delineating between bullish and bearish local regimes.
To provide greater statistical context, we apply standard deviation bands around the STH cost basis to define dynamic support and resistance zones. These bands quantify the range of market consensus among short-term participants, with the outer bounds often signaling zones of trend exhaustion or breakout potential.
STH CB +1œÉ: $115.4k
STH Cost Basis: $97.6k
STH CB -1œÉ: $83.9k
During the recent market contraction, price began to approach the STH cost basis at $97k, yet ultimately found demand and reversed at the $101k level. This is a constructive signal, as the price not only front-ran a retest of the STH-CB but also held above the psychologically significant $100k mark, suggesting investor confidence remains robust.
Live Chart
We can complement our observation of the Short-Term Holder investors by assessing the cost-basis of individual sub-groups within the cohort. We can consider these as a sort of fast-to-slow ribbon of cost basis levels, providing a form of momentum indicator:
The recent upwards impulse has led to a notable reduction in financial pressure and stress on these investors with all new demand sub-groups now in a profitable position. If sustained, this can be considered as another positive observation for market momentum, with nearly all denominations of investors now in profit.
Live Chart
To close out, we turn to the URPD (UTXO Realized Price Distribution) metric, which illustrates the on-chain volume profile of all circulating coins by their acquisition price. During the recent correction, price retraced into the core of the supply cluster, reaching the midpoint of the underlying support zone. As highlighted earlier, the absence of significant panic selling among underwater investors, coupled with the swift recovery in price, marks a positive development.
Currently, Bitcoin sits on the upper edge of a dense supply cluster, with relatively sparse on-chain volume located above. As price enters this air gap region, where fewer coins have historically transacted, market momentum now depends on the strength of demand. To sustain the uptrend and push into price discovery, bullish pressure must decisively outweigh any emerging sell-side resistance.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
With Bitcoin trading just below its all-time high, distribution from mature investors has accelerated, with realized profits peaking at over +$930M per day. Despite this marked uptick in spending activity, a unique dynamic of this cycle persists where maturation and accumulation pressures continue to outweigh Long-Term Holder sell-side flows, leaving this cohort with an unusually large share of network wealth for such a late stage in the bull market.
Concurrently, volatility expectations are beginning to rise, driven by the dense concentration of coin supply near the current spot price. This clustering increases market sensitivity to price fluctuations. However, Options At-the-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IVs) across all major tenors remain historically low, suggesting that options traders may be underpricing the likelihood of a volatility regime shift.
With volatility potentially on the horizon, we turn to key technical and on-chain cost-basis levels to assess market conviction and critical support/resistance thresholds. The $97.6k Short-Term Holder cost basis continues to serve as a pivotal support level necessary for maintaining local bullish momentum. On the upside, the $115.4k zone emerges as the first significant resistance should the market enter price discovery."

Network activity shows a decline in transaction count but a rise in settlement volume, pointing to increased usage by large entities. While fewer transactions are being broadcast, the average transaction size has grown significantly, indicating that institutional or high-net-worth participants are becoming more dominant in on-chain activity.
Fee pressure remains subdued, with minimal demand for block space despite Bitcoin trading near all-time highs. This presents a notable divergence from previous cycles, where periods of elevated prices typically coincided with fee spikes due to congestion and heightened network usage.
Activity has increasingly migrated to off-chain venues, with centralized exchanges now commanding the majority of trading volume, with futures markets in particular leading this shift. Notably, combined spot, futures, and options volumes routinely surpass on-chain settlement by 7‚Äì16x.
Leverage continues to accumulate, with total open interest in futures and options reaching $96.2B. Importantly, the collateral composition has improved materially, with stablecoin-margined positions now comprising the majority of open interest.

A Quiet Chain
Bitcoin is holding firmly above the psychologically significant $100K level, and is just 6% shy of its all-time high of $111.7K. One might expect on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network to be equally vibrant, however a distinct divergence has emerged; whilst spot prices remain elevated, network activity is unusually quiet.
To assess this disconnect, we begin by examining the number of transactions settled each day by the Bitcoin network. Throughout 2023 and 2024, transaction counts experienced a structured uptrend, peaking at 734k per day. However, since the start of 2025, throughput has declined markedly, with daily transactions ranging between 320k and 500k per day, a notable contraction compared to the cycle‚Äôs earlier highs.
Live Chart
To better understand the nature of activity on the Bitcoin network, we can classify transactions into two categories:
Monetary transactions, which involve the transfer of value.
Non-monetary transactions, such as those related to Inscriptions and Runes, which embed arbitrary data via Taproot witness data and OP_RETURN fields, respectively.
The number of monetary transactions has remained relatively stable over the past year, suggesting a consistent base of value transfer activity. On the other hand, non-monetary transactions have exhibited a more volatile pattern. Between July and December 2024, demand for non-monetary transactions surged, significantly increasing the total transaction count. However, since the start of 2025, non-monetary activity has declined significantly, heavily contributing to the recent contraction in overall network throughput.
Live Chart
Volumes Remains Robust
Despite this contraction in transaction counts, the economic volume settled on the Bitcoin network has remained historically elevated, with a yearly average of $7.5B settled per day, and hitting a peak of $16B during the $100k ATH price break in November last year.
Live Chart
The average volume per transaction currently stands at $36.2k, suggesting that while fewer transactions are taking place, each transaction is carrying a significant value payload. This trend implies that larger entities continue to utilize the Bitcoin network, with the throughput per transaction rising even as overall activity by count declines.
Live Chart
To evaluate the hypothesis that large entities are increasingly using the Bitcoin network for value transfer, we can analyze settlement volume by transaction size. Transactions exceeding $100k have shown a clear structural rise in dominance, accounting for 66% of network volume in November 2022, and increasing to 89% today. This trend reinforces the view that high-value participants are becoming increasingly dominant within on-chain activity.
Live Chart
Conversely, volume in transactions spending $100k or less have undergone a meaningful contraction over the same period. After peaking at a relative dominance of 34% in December 2022, this cohort‚Äôs share of total transfer volume has declined structurally to just 11% today.
A more granular breakdown of the individual sub-cohorts reveals that this trend is consistent across the board, with each group experiencing a meaningful decline in their share of network volume.
$0-$1k: 3.9% to 0.9%
$1k-$10k: 8.4% to 2.1%
$10k-$100k: 21.4% to 7.9%
Live Chart
Fee Pressure at Historical Lows
Over the years, Bitcoin transaction fees have been influenced by both technical upgrades, and shifting usage patterns. The introduction of SegWit reduced the effective size of transactions, offering fee discounts, while exchange batching has become an industry standard practice, which further improved efficiency by consolidating multiple withdrawals into single transactions. More recently, Inscriptions and Runes, which embed arbitrary data onto the blockchain, have led to periodic fee surges, often congesting the network.
Historically, fee pressure has served as a reliable proxy for network demand, rising sharply when block-space is small relative to overall transaction demand. Fees inherently function as a release valve in high-pressure environments, where limited block-space forces users to compete for transaction inclusion and ordering. Thus, elevated fees are often indicative of heightened demand for block space, signalling periods of intense user activity and often speculative interest.
Over the past few months however, miner revenue from transaction fees has declined significantly, averaging just $558K per day over the last month. This subdued fee pressure indicates a notable drop in block-space demand, sending a similar signal to the overall reduction in transaction counts.
Live Chart
The Fee Revenue Multiple (FRM) compares the ratio between total miner rewards (block subsidy and transaction fees) to just fees alone. This ratio offers insight into the composition and dominance of miner income.
During previous bull markets, and commonly around all-time high formations, this ratio tends to compress, with fee pressure surging in response to heightened network activity, and increased demand for transaction inclusion.
However, our current cycle presents a somewhat unique market structure, with the FRM ratio remaining unusually elevated, despite Bitcoin trading just below its all-time high. This divergence underscores that there is currently a relative lack of fee-pressure, suggesting on-chain activity is surprisingly quiet, especially for a market trading to close to the all-time-high price.
Live Chart
Heightened Off-Chain Volume
The Bitcoin economy consists of both on-chain and off-chain components, each playing a critical role in the asset‚Äôs market dynamics. As Bitcoin matures and the range of available financial instruments expands, centralized exchanges have become increasingly influential. These platforms facilitate the majority of trading activity and serve as key venues for price discovery.
As a result, evaluating off-chain activity on exchanges is an essential input for constructing a holistic view of the activity encompassing the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Starting with the spot market, trading activity across centralized exchanges has remained strong over the past year, averaging $10B in daily volume, and peaking at $23B in November 2024. Notably, this magnitude of spot volume is often comparable in size to the volume settled on-chain each day, highlighting the parallel scale of activity between the spot market and the base layer network.
Live Chart
Moving towards the derivatives market, futures volume in both perpetual and calendar contracts experience the largest amount of volume traded by a wide margin, and are typically an order of magnitude larger than on-chain, spot, and options volume.
Trading activity across futures contracts has experienced substantial growth this cycle, averaging $57B/day traded over the past year. Furthermore, futures volume reached a staggering peak of $122B/day in November 2024. The magnitude of volume traded in futures markets highlights how dominant these preferred instruments are for both speculators, traders, and for hedging risk.
Live Chart
Additionally, options trade volume has experienced a significant uptick over the course of this cycle, now averaging $2.4B per day over the past year, and reaching a peak of $5B/day. This surge highlights the growing usage of options contracts by sophisticated market participants, with investors increasingly utilizing options to implement advanced risk management strategies and fine-tune their market exposure.
Live Chart
The growth of spot and derivative volumes highlights a shift in activity, with an ever growing share of volume migrating from the Bitcoin base layer towards off-chain venues. When comparing the volume traded off-chain (spot, futures and options), to value settled on the network, we note off-chain volume has regularly been 7-16x larger than the on-chain volume.
This transition can significantly impact how we interpret network metrics, as traditional indicators may no longer capture the full scope of market activity. Nevertheless, the on-chain market remains at the heart of the Bitcoin economy, forming the foundational layer upon which the wider ecosystem operates. Deposits and withdrawals serve as the primary link between off-chain platforms and the Bitcoin network, and it remains very likely that on-chain activity will continue to play a vital role in market structure and capital flows.
Live Chart
Leverage Build Up
Now that we have established the growing relevance of derivatives within the Bitcoin ecosystem, we now turn our attention to the open interest held across both futures and options contracts to evaluate the build-up of leverage in the market.
Both markets have experienced remarkable growth in OI over last few years, with futures open interest rising from $7.7B to $52.8B, and options expanding from $3.2B to $43.4B. Combined, total derivatives open interest peaked at $114B and remains elevated at approximately $96.2B. This sustained expansion reflects a significant build up of leverage within the Bitcoin economy, potentially heightening the risk of volatile price swings.
Live Chart
When assessing the 30-day change in aggregate open interest, we observe that the magnitude of fluctuations has been accelerating. Throughout the 2023 calendar year, changes in open interest remained relatively muted, however, following the introduction of US Spot ETFs in January 2024, these fluctuations began to intensify.
This growing volatility in open interest signals a broader market transition, from one primarily driven by spot activity, to a more derivatives-led structure. Such a shift increases the risk of cascading liquidations and contributes to a more unstable and reflexive market environment.
Live Chart
To quantify the buildup of leverage, we calculate the Realized Cap Leverage Ratio, which compares aggregate open interest to Bitcoin‚Äôs realized cap (the aggregate USD value stored on the network). Significant positive deviations in this ratio signal heightened speculative activity in derivatives markets relative to the asset‚Äôs underlying size, indicating increased leverage, and potential fragility in market structure. Conversely, contractions in the ratio suggest a period of de-leveraging is underway.
Currently, the leverage ratio remains elevated at 10.2%, with only 182 out of 1679 trading days (10.8%) recording a higher value. This highlights the substantial build-up of leverage in the market and further reinforces the growing dominance of derivatives in shaping the current market regime.
Live Chart
However, the collateral structure underpinning open interest is not uniform, as traders can choose between stablecoin- or crypto-margined collateral. Stablecoin-margined positions are more conservative, with collateral pegged to the US dollar, where as crypto-margined positions introduce an additional layer of volatility to the trade, with the value of the underlying collateral itself fluctuating with the wider market.
To assess the overall health of the collateral structure in derivatives markets, we calculate the Realized Cap Leverage Ratio separately for stablecoin- and crypto-margined open interest. Notably, during the 2018‚Äì2021 cycle, crypto-margined collateral was the preferred choice among investors. Coupled with the widespread availability of 100x leverage, this structurally weaker collateral base played a significant role in exacerbating the May 2021 market drawdown.
Encouragingly, since the high-profile collapse of FTX, stablecoin-margined collateral has become the dominant form of margin, now accounting for the super-majority of open interest collateral. This shift highlights the maturation of the derivative complex around digital assets, and a move toward more stable risk management practices.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs elevated price, a clear divergence has emerged between market valuation and network activity, with transaction counts remaining unusually low, largely due to a sharp decline in non-monetary transactions. This drop in throughput has led to a significant fall in fee-based miner revenue, contrasting sharply with previous bull cycles where price rallies typically brought network congestion and surging fees.
Nevertheless, the volume settled by the network remains substantial, settling an average $7.5B per day. The combination of low transaction count and a heightened volume throughput suggests large entities are becoming increasingly dominant within on-chain activity. Additionally, volume traded across off-chain venues has recorded strong growth, with combined spot, futures and options volume regularly exceeding on-chain settlement volume by a factor of 7‚Äì16x.
Leverage continues to build in the derivatives market with the aggregate futures and options open interest remaining historically elevated at $96.2B. However, the composition of the underlying collateral structure has markedly improved, with stablecoin-margined positions now comprising the majority of open interest. This shift highlights the maturation of the derivative complex around digital assets, and a move toward more stable risk management practices."

Headline volatility defines recent moves:
Bitcoin briefly dropped to $99k amid geopolitical tensions, then rebounded to $106k after headlines of de-escalation circulated. Price remains within the $100k‚Äì$110k range, where it has consolidated since early May.
Strong structural support at $93k‚Äì$100k:
The CBD Heatmap shows concentrated accumulation in this zone, formed during Q1 2025. As long as the price holds above it, the bull trend remains structurally intact.
Profitability and activity metrics cooling down:
Realized profit is tapering off from the third major wave of this cycle. On-chain transfer volume dropped ~32%, and spot volume remains low at $7.7B, reflecting reduced investor engagement.
Futures markets are still active, but with lower conviction:
Despite high trading volume, open interest dropped 7% and liquidations have surged on both sides. Falling funding rates and 3M basis show declining appetite for long-biased exposure.
Momentum fades, but risks are balanced:
The market is in a holding pattern. While structure remains supportive, a breakout to new highs will likely require a clear pickup in demand, activity, and conviction.

Headline Whiplash
Bitcoin dropped to ~$99k over the weekend as geopolitical tensions flared, briefly testing support just above the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $98.2k. The move was quickly reversed, with the price rebounding to $106k after de-escalation headlines on Tuesday.
The market has now returned to its familiar $100k‚Äì$110k range, where it has been consolidating since May 8, reflecting continued uncertainty amid headline-driven volatility.
Live Chart
Holding the Line
A closer look at the CBD Heatmap reveals that over the weekend, Bitcoin‚Äôs drop to $99k found support near the upper edge of a dense supply zone between $93k and $100k. This zone has been a key area of activity since the top formation in Q1 2025, marking it as a structurally important level.
As long as the price holds above this range, the bull market structure remains intact. However, a breakdown below could trigger a deeper correction, especially if holders with a cost basis in this zone begin to capitulate and add to the sell pressure.
Live Chart
Leverage Flushed on Both Sides
The sharp price swings over the weekend triggered heightened volatility in the futures market, with liquidations spiking to $28.6M for longs and $25.2M for shorts within 24 hours. This dual-sided flush reflects how quickly sentiment flipped as the market reacted to headlines.
At the same time, BTC-denominated open interest dropped from 360k BTC to 334k BTC, a decline of ~7%, highlighting that leveraged traders were caught off guard in both directions. The sharp reduction in open interest suggests a temporary clearing of speculative excess, resetting positioning in the derivatives market.
Live Chart
Despite the market reclaiming the $100k‚Äì$110k range, signs of diminishing profitability and sluggish on-chain activity are becoming more apparent. These trends are typical in choppy consolidation phases, where volatility fades and investor engagement cools.
Until we see a pickup in profitability and activity metrics, the likelihood of a breakout to new all-time highs remains limited. For now, the market appears to be digesting prior gains, awaiting fresh momentum and an influx of new demand.
Profits Taper and Volume Fades
To assess the profitability of investors, we examine the 30-day moving average of realized profit alongside the cumulative realized profit in both the 2020‚Äì2022 and current bull markets. This comparison highlights how capital rotation has evolved across cycles.
During the 2020‚Äì2022 market, Bitcoin investors realized around $550B in profit across multiple rallies, including two major waves. In the current cycle, realized profit has already reached $650B, surpassing the previous cycle‚Äôs sum total.
Currently, the market appears to be in a cool-down phase after the third significant wave of profit-taking, indicating that while large gains have been secured, momentum is now easing as realized profitability tapers off.
Live Chart
A similar cooling pattern is evident across key activity metrics. The 7-day moving average of on-chain transfer volume has dropped ~32%, from a peak of $76B in late May to $52B over the recent weekend.
Live Chart
Unlike the ATH rallies in Q2 and Q4 2024, the recent push to $111k was not accompanied by a surge in spot volume. Current spot volume sits at $7.7B, significantly lower than the cyclical peaks observed earlier in this bull market. This divergence further underscores the lack of speculative intensity, highlighting the market‚Äôs hesitancy and reinforcing the consolidation narrative.
Live Chart
Meanwhile, the futures market volume has also been undergoing a multi-week cooldown, consistent with broader market fatigue. However, unlike the spot market, futures participants remained actively engaged during the rally to $111k. This sustained speculative interest suggests that leverage-driven positioning was more influential in recent price dynamics.

That being said, this sustained futures market participation has been losing its aggressiveness since the Q1 2025 all-time high. Both the annualized funding rate and the 3-month futures rolling basis have shown a continuous downtrend, reflecting a declining appetite to take long positions, even as trading volume remains elevated. This points to a more cautious and less conviction-driven speculative environment. It may also indicate a larger volume of cash & carry arbitrage positions, and even heightened short-side interest.

Conclusion & Discussion
Bitcoin remains range-bound between $100k and $110k, with recent price action driven by macro headlines and sharp reversals. The CBD Heatmap shows strong support at $93k‚Äì$100k, a key zone from the Q1 2025 top formation.
However, signs of market fatigue are building. Profit realization is cooling, on-chain activity is declining, and spot volume failed to rise meaningfully during the recent ATH push. While futures participation remains active, falling funding rates and futures rolling basis signal a cautious stance among speculators.
As long as the price holds above key support, the bull trend remains intact. But without a revival in demand and conviction, the odds of a breakout to new highs appear limited in the near term."

The scale of the Bitcoin network remains remarkably impressive, now recording a market cap of $2.1T, and a realized cap of $955B. Together, they highlight not only the substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin, but also its maturation toward becoming a multi-trillion-dollar asset.
Following a recovery to $107k, a super-majority of Bitcoin investors are now holding unrealized profits. In total, the unrealized profit held across investors sits at a staggering $1.2T.
HODLing appears to be the dominant market mechanic across a plethora of spending metrics, with realized profit taking declining, liveliness continuing to trend downwards, and Long-Term Holder supply surging to a new ATH.
Stablecoin purchasing power remains largely neutral, suggesting that the market views the current price level as being at a relative equilibrium. Additionally, demand from institutions for regulated Bitcoin exposure remains robust, with sustained and sizeable inflows.

Market Recap
As tensions escalated between Israel and Iran last week, markets responded with a sharp sell-off, with Bitcoin prices dropping from $106K to $99K. However, the market found strong support near the Short-Term Holder cost basis at $98.3K, a key level that often distinguishes between local bullish and bearish conditions.
In a market driven by geopolitical headlines, the risk of further downside is still in the air, however, a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the two nations has helped stabilize sentiment, and fuel a recovery to $107k.
The market‚Äôs ability to hold the Short-Term Holder cost basis during such a volatile and uncertain period is a constructive signal, suggesting that the bulls are still in control, and that underlying momentum may remain skewed to the upside.
Live Chart
Total Profitability
With Bitcoin trading just shy of its all-time high, we can apply two valuation frameworks to assess the assets current scale. The first is the traditional Market Capitalization, which values each coin in the circulating supply at the current market price. The second uses on-chain pricestamping of each coin to compute the Realized Cap, which values each coin at the last transacted price, and provides a more accurate measurement of true network liquidity.
Market Cap: $2.13T
Realized Cap: $958B
Both measures have experienced substantial growth this cycle, with the market cap rising from a low of $304B to $2.13T, whilst the realized cap has surged from $400B to $955B. Together, they highlight not only the substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin, but also its maturation toward becoming a multi-trillion-dollar asset.
Live Chart
If we consider market capitalization as the spot valuation of the circulating supply, and the realized capitalization as the value ‚Äòsaved‚Äô or ‚Äòstored‚Äô in BTC, then the difference between the two represents the unrealized profit (or loss) held by investors across the network.
At present, the total unrealized profit stands at an estimated $1.2 trillion, underscoring the substantial value appreciation experienced by Bitcoin investors, but also the incentive for potential sell-side pressure that may emerge if sentiment shifts.
Live Chart
The MVRV metric provides us with an alternative, dimensionless view on investor profitability, and is constructed as the ratio of Market Cap / Realized Cap. This provides crucial information on the magnitude of paper gains, or losses held by the average market participant.
At the moment, the average paper gain held per investor stands at +125%, suggesting Bitcoin investors are sitting on significant profits. This remains substantially lower than the +180% profitability seen in March-2024 when the price hit the then $73k ATH, and also when the market initially broke $100k in Dec-2024.
With dollar-denominated unrealized profits trading near ATHs and the MVRV Ratio lower than the peak by comparison, this highlights a divergence between the two profitability measures. This suggests that the realized cap (capital inflows) has grown at a relatively faster rate compared to the market cap (price appreciation) over recent months.
Live Chart
To increase the granularity of our analysis, we construct an oscillator designed to assess the profitability status across various coin age cohorts. This equal-weighted composite measures the number of age-based cohorts that, on average, are holding their coins in profit. Conceptually, this functions as a type of momentum indicator, tracking whether a growing share of the investor base is moving into profit or loss.
We can observe that the recent price contraction did not significantly impact investor profitability, unlike the sharper drawdowns seen during the accumulation ranges of May‚ÄìSep 2024 and Jan‚ÄìApr 2025. In addition, the composite has recently crossed above its +1 standard deviation threshold, signaling a positive profitability across holders of all coin ages, and a likely positive backdrop for sentiment.
Live Chart
Profits Continue to Dry Up
Now that we have established that the market is holding substantial unrealized profits, the next step is to assess how these investors are responding, and whether they are taking profit off the table.
To evaluate this, we can observe the magnitude of profit or loss locked in by transactions occurring on-chain each day. Realized profits have remained relatively muted over recent weeks, especially when considering that prices are only a stones throw off the ATH.
Around $872M worth of is currently being locked in profit per day, which is notably less that the $2.8B and $3.2B in realized profit seen during the $73K, and $107K all-time high formations, respectively.
Live Chart
The decline in sell-side pressure is particularly evident when examining the total supply held by the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort, which recently reached a new all-time high of 14.7M BTC. This underscores that HODLing remains the dominant market behavior amongst investors, with accumulation and maturation flows significantly outweighing distribution pressures.
The 155-day time threshold required for coins to enter the LTH cohort is currently approaching the second ATH formation in late January. This indicates that investors who purchased during the breakout above $100K have largely held onto their coins, indicative of constructive sentiment under the surface.
Live Chart
The Liveliness metric also captures this change in market character, and is constructed by assessing the all-time balance between coinday destruction (spending) and coinday creation (HODLing).
Uptrends suggests spending is the dominant investor preference.
Downtrends suggest HODLing is the dominant market mechanic.
During the two previous all-time high formations, the Liveliness metric saw meaningful upticks, highlighting a market dominated by spending activity and profit taking. Interestingly, this typical characteristic was absent during the most recent ATH break, and Liveliness has continued trending downward.
This further reinforces that HODLing remains the dominant behavior among investors, and that a range expansion in price may be necessary to incentivize renewed spending activity.
Live Chart
The Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a powerful tool used to gauge both investor activity in the markets, as well as whether the market is approaching degree of equilibrium. It can be interpreted within the following framework:
High values
indicate that investors are realizing significant profits or losses relative to their cost basis. This typically follows a high-volatility price move and suggests that the market may need time to re-establish equilibrium.
Low values
imply that coins are being spent near their original cost basis, signaling that profit and loss-taking has diminished. This reflects a more balanced market and often coincides with periods of reduced volatility.
Following an uptick in profit-taking at the all-time high, the Short-Term Holder cohort has markedly reduced their distribution pressures. This again suggests that the current price range is not compelling enough for investors to continue selling, implying that the market may need to move higher (or lower) to unlock additional supply.
Live Chart
In confluence, a similar structure is emerging across the profit and loss-taking behavior of Long-Term Holders. Following a brief uptick in sell-side pressure into the all-time high, these mature investors have also significantly slowed their spending.
This behavior aligns with broader market signals, including the overall decline in realized profit and loss volumes, the continued surge in Long-Term Holder supply, and the sustained downtrend in the Liveliness metric. All of these indicators reinforce a view that HODLing is the dominant behavior for investors at the present time.
Live Chart
In Search of Demand
Stablecoins have become a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem, serving as the primary quote asset for trading across both centralized and decentralized venues. Functionally, they represent readily available capital, or ""dry powder"", available for digital asset purchases.
To quantify the purchasing power of stablecoins, we can employ the Stablecoin Supply Ratio Oscillator (SSR), which measures the ratio between the Bitcoin supply and the supply of stablecoins (denominated in BTC). This metric offers a proxy for the relative demand pressure between BTC and USD liquidity:
Low SSR
signals greater stablecoin-denominated buying power relative to BTC supply.
High SSR
suggests reduced stablecoin purchasing capacity relative to BTC, potentially reflecting weaker demand.
Currently, the normalized Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) is oscillating near its baseline, another measure suggesting that the market views the current price level as being at a relative equilibrium. This is particularly notable when compared to the previous $100K breakout, during which the SSR was significantly higher. Despite similar price levels, this shift suggests that investor purchasing power has improved markedly, reflecting stronger underlying demand conditions.
Live Chart
Another way we can assess the relative strength of stablecoin purchasing power is through the Exchange Buying Power metric. This metrics records the 30-day change in major stablecoin supplies on exchanges, and subtracts the USD denominated 30-day change in BTC and ETH flows, and can be considered under the following framework.
Positive values and uptrends
indicate that a larger or increasing volume of USD-denominated stablecoins is flowing into exchanges relative to BTC and ETH over the past 30 days. This trend suggests greater stablecoin buying power is available on exchanges, which may support increased demand and liquidity for major crypto assets.
Negative values and downtrends
reflect a smaller or decreasing flow of stablecoins into exchanges relative to BTC and ETH over the same period. This points to reduced stablecoin-denominated buying power, potentially signaling weaker demand and tighter liquidity conditions across the market.
The market appears to be transitioning away from a strong period of stablecoin inflows into exchanges regime, suggesting a potential rotation of liquidity from stablecoins, into the major assets. If sustained, this could be considered as a tailwind for digital asset valuations, as stablecoin capital is deployed.
Live Chart
As Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization expands, increasingly larger capital inflows are required to meaningfully move its valuation. Therefore, the final demand vector we can assess is that coming from institutions, best reflected through net flows into the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Aggregate net inflows have been accelerating in recent weeks, reaching a 7-day average peak of +$298 million. This sustained and sizeable buy-side pressure is a constructive signal, highlighting growing institutional engagement at scale.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusion
After finding firm support at the Short-Term Holder cost basis of $98.3K, a level that often delineates local bull and bear regimes, Bitcoin rebounded to $107K. This move pushed the majority of investors back into profit, with total unrealized gains reaching a staggering $1.2T.
Despite this surge in profitability, investor behavior signals a strong preference for HODLing, as the current price range appears insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking. This is reflected in declining realized profits, a continued downtrend in Liveliness, and Long-Term Holder supply climbing to a new all-time high.
As price revisits the previous ATH range, we note that stablecoin purchasing power has improved meaningfully, pointing to a more robust and stable demand backdrop. Meanwhile, institutional appetite remains firm, with consistent and sizeable inflows into regulated Bitcoin products."
2025,27,2025-W27,2025-06-30,2025-07-06,Bullish,107173.21,109217.98,108127.91,1.91,Agree,"Executive Summary
Across a variety of measures, investors appear to be favoring accumulation over distribution. Notably, Long-Term Holder supply continues to climb, whilst Shrimp (<1 BTC), Crabs (1‚Äì10 BTC), and Fish (10‚Äì100 BTC) continue to accumulate coins at a pace of +19.3k BTC/Month, which is significantly larger than the monthly issuance of +13.4k BTC/Month.
There‚Äôs growing confluence across both on-chain and derivatives markets, with several indicators pointing toward elevated volatility expectations. This observation is similarly supported by the coiling and compression of price across multiple timeframes.
While ETF inflows have cooled slightly, total AUM across the complex has hit a new ATH of $137B. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT continues to dominate, now representing 55% of the total, with Fidelity and Grayscale following at 16.2% and 14.7%, respectively.

An Accumulation Dominant Regime
Since the start of the month, Bitcoin price action has remained largely flat, oscillating within an increasingly narrow price range just below the all-time high of $111.7K.
Since there is no near-term directional bias to the market, we can turn to the Accumulation Trend Score to evaluate the underlying investor behavior within the current price range. Notably, the past two months have seen Bitcoin within a moderately strong accumulation regime, suggesting that market participants view the current price as offering relatively compelling value.
Live Chart
This trend is more clearly illustrated by the raw Accumulation Trend Score when plotted as a timeseries. During the initial $100K breakout, a strong wave of accumulation emerged, driving the market higher. This gradually gave way to a dominant distribution phase, and price action stalled and reversed as a result.
A comparable pattern has appeared around the most recent ATH, with renewed accumulation pressures taking hold. However, unlike the earlier cycle, accumulation has remained relatively elevated, and is trading above its historical average, even as the market trades sideways.
This suggests that investors increasingly see the current range as a more favorable environment, despite price conditions being similar to those during the previous distribution phase in late-2024.
A particularly interesting example of recent accumulation behavior can be seen within the ongoing growth in Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply. When comparing the 30-day change in LTH supply to the monthly issuance rate, it becomes clear that LTH accumulation is significantly outpacing new coin issuance to miners.
This suggests a general tightening of supply, as a growing share of coins transition into LTH status, with holders displaying the characteristics of a price insensitive investor. These tenured investors appear unwilling to distribute their coins at the current spot price, and require a meaningful market move before the next wave of action unfolds.
Live Chart
In addition, accumulation trends can also be evaluated through wallet size heuristics, with this analysis focusing on entities holding less than 100 BTC. These cohorts, commonly categorized as Shrimp (<1 BTC), Crabs (1‚Äì10 BTC), and Fish (10‚Äì100 BTC), represent a broad spectrum of investors, ranging from retail participants to high-net-worth individuals.
Currently, the combined balance growth across these groups is increasing at a pace of +19.3k BTC/month, overwhelming the current monthly issuance rate of +13.4k BTC/month. This adds another layer of evidence supporting the view that supply-side conditions are tightening, as a wide base of holders continues to absorb newly issued supply.
Live Chart
Volatility Expectations Continue to Compress
With a range of metrics indicating an ongoing tightening of the supply side, the market becomes increasingly susceptible to demand shocks, where even modest fluctuations can induce significant price volatility. To evaluate the potential for such volatility, we turn our attention to a suite of volatility indicators.
Starting with Realized Volatility measured across multiple time-frames, we observe a prolonged contraction in volatility over recent weeks, as Bitcoin continues to coil within a narrow consolidation range. Historically, such volatility compressions have preceded significant market moves, and served as early indicators of an impending phase of heightened volatility.
Below are the number of trading days since December 2022 where Realized Volatility for each respective timeframe has recorded a higher value than its current level:
1-Week Realized Volatility: 796/951 (84%)
1-Month Realized Volatility: 856/951 (89%)
3-Months Realized Volatility: 914/951 (96%)
6-Months Realized Volatility: 732/951 (77%)
Live Chart
Additionally, At-the-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) for options markets are also declining over recent weeks, indicating that options traders are not pricing in a shift toward a high-volatility regime. Historically, subdued volatility expectations like these have often preceded sharp market moves, acting as a contrarian signal.
Below are the number of trading days since December 2022 where Implied Volatility for each respective timeframe has recorded a higher value than its current level:
1-Week ATM Percentile 845 / 951 (88.9%)
1-Month ATM Percentile 853 / 951 (89.7%)
3-Months ATM Percentile 837 / 951 (88%)
6-Months ATH Percentile 888 / 951 (93.4%)
Live Chart
From an on-chain perspective, the Realized Supply Density metric offers insight into how much of the circulating supply is concentrated within a ¬±10% band of the current spot price. When supply is heavily clustered around the current price, even modest market moves can sharply shift investor profitability, thereby amplifying volatility.
At present, approximately 19% of the circulating supply is positioned within this ¬±10% range, indicating a substantial concentration of cost basis near the current price. This configuration implies that a large portion of the market is sensitive to short-term price fluctuations, increasing the likelihood of reactive behavior when the market finally breaks away from this price zone.
Live Chart
We can also assess volatility expectations through the lens of pure price action by calculating the percentage range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 30 days. This allows us to quantify the degree of price compression observed in the market.
Notably, only 6% of trading days have recorded a tighter 30-day range than the current one, underscoring the exceptional degree of volatility compression presently occurring in the spot market.
Live Chart
Furthermore, we can bolster the above observation by assessing price compression over a 60-day window. When analyzing this bi-monthly timeframe, we find that price consolidation is even more pronounced, with only 0.4% of trading days exhibiting a tighter range.
The confluence across both the 30-day and 60-day measures suggests that volatility is not only compressing over short-term horizons but is also tightening across broader timeframes. This multi-scale compression indicates a market coiling with increasing intensity, where the longer the period of consolidation persists, the greater the potential energy stored within the price structure.
As a result, the magnitude of the subsequent breakout (or break-down) is likely supported by a major expansion in volatility, with heightened potential for a sharp directional move.
Live Chart
ETF AUM Reaches ATH
Inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs remain a significant source of demand for Bitcoin. However, aggregate net inflows across the ETF complex have moderated over the past week, declining to just +$144M.
Despite this near-term slowdown, the broader trend remains constructive. When viewed over a multi-month horizon, buy-side pressure has been both sustained and sizeable, underscoring the continued growth of institutional engagement.
Live Chart
While net inflows have cooled in recent days, the total AUM across all U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs has surged to a new all-time high of $137B. This milestone reflects the depth and resilience of institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin access.
In fact, the aggregate size of the ETF complex now positions it among the top 10 largest ETF categories by AUM, solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs presence within the upper echelon of global investment vehicles.
Live Chart
Furthermore, the total AUM of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now represents 6.4% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total market capitalization, marking a new all-time high for ETF ownership. This rising share highlights that a steadily increasing portion of the supply is being absorbed through regulated, professionally managed investment vehicles, as the asset continues to integrate with traditional financial infrastructure.
Live Chart
When increasing our granularity into the ETF complex, we can observe that Blackrock‚Äôs IBIT ETF continues to acquire an increasing percentage of market share, reaching an ATH of 55% of the total AUM. Following IBIT, Fidelity and Grayscale rank as the second and third largest ETFs by assets under management, holding 16.2% and 14.7% of the market share, respectively.
Live Chart
However, when evaluating the 30-day balance change across the three leading ETFs, BlackRock has consistently attracted a significant share of inflows throughout 2025, while both Fidelity and Grayscale have shown signs of stagnation in recent months.
Live Chart
One likely reason for BlackRock‚Äôs surging dominance in 2025 is its overwhelming lead in the options market. IBIT currently accounts for ~97% of total open interest across Bitcoin ETF options, and is orders of magnitudes ahead of its peers:
IBIT:
4.2M contracts
FBTC:
81K contracts
BITB:
15K contracts
IBIT‚Äôs leadership is driven by a self-reinforcing liquidity loop. Its large AUM and trading volumes attract market makers who offer tighter bid-ask spreads and lowers execution costs. This improves trading conditions and draws increased participation from both institutional and retail investors, further amplifying volume and open interest.
As a result, IBIT has become the default venue for Bitcoin options strategies, making it increasingly difficult for smaller ETFs with wider spreads and thinner liquidity to gain ground.
With BlackRock‚Äôs U.S Spot Bitcoin ETF gaining market share and dominating the options open interest landscape, its deposit cost basis has become the most representative of broader market positioning.
When overlaying the BlackRock Deposit Cost Basis with the True Market Mean and the Active Investor Price (both models designed to estimate the average cost basis of investors actively participating in the current cycle), we can observe a striking similarity among these cost-bases.
Blackrock Deposit Cost-Basis: $75.3k
True Market Mean: $72.2k
Active Investor Cost-Basis: $78.4k
The True Market Mean and Active Investor Price are both key psychological and statistical valuation anchors, thus, the close alignment of BlackRock‚Äôs ETF Deposit Cost-Basis with these models underscores the growing influence of ETF flows within the Bitcoin market. As ETFs become more embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem, its cost-basis is increasingly converging with that of the average investor, further reinforcing its influence on market psychology and price discovery.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
The Bitcoin market continues to show signs of accumulation, with Long-Term Holder supply climbing to new highs. Additionally, smaller investor cohorts, ranging from Shrimps to Fish, are collectively acquiring over 19.3k BTC/Month, significantly outpacing the monthly issuance of 13.4k BTC. This dynamic points to ongoing supply-side tightening and a growing conviction among participants to hold through current price levels.
As the supply-side continues to constrict, the market becomes increasingly susceptible to demand shocks, where even modest fluctuations can induce significant price volatility. This thesis is supported by a range of indicators across both on-chain and derivatives markets, which are signalling elevated volatility expectations.
Despite a cooling down in ETF inflows, the aggregate ETF AUM has reached new highs of $137B, driven in large part by BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, which now commands over half the market share. Furthermore, the cost basis of IBIT deposits now closely aligns with key valuation metrics such as the Active Investor Price and True Market Mean. This convergence underscores the growing structural and psychological connection between the ETF complex and the broader Bitcoin market, highlighting the increasing integration of traditional financial products into the digital asset ecosystem."

Bitcoin has successfully broken new ATH, and is above two key accumulation zones, signalling strong bullish momentum and renewed investor confidence.
Short-term holders are now sitting on significant unrealized profits, pushing several metrics describing this investor cohort towards overheated territory.
We have observed the first wave of coins being spent at high profit following the ATH break-out, a behaviour which is typical during market euphoria phases.
The Realized Profit to Loss Ratio spiked sharply, well above the 2 standard deviation threshold, before cooling off to more moderate levels later in the week.
Historically, major market tops tend to form after multiple waves of sustained profit-taking by investors. If demand for Bitcoin remains resilient, and the market has another rally higher, the ~$130k price is the next major statistically significant resistance level.
While bullish momentum continues, signs of demand-side stress suggest rising caution is warranted in the near term.

Above Accumulation Zones
After weeks of sideways chop between $100k‚Äì$110k, Bitcoin has regained upside momentum and broken to a new ATH of $122k. According to the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) Heatmap, this consolidation phase saw heavy accumulation in both the $93k‚Äì$97k and $104k‚Äì$110k zones.
Breaking above these dense supply clusters may now establish strong support, forming a potential foundation for future market pullbacks.
Live Chart
Back In Price Discovery
As Bitcoin enters a new phase of price discovery, the majority of the supply is now held in profit. According to the Cost Basis Distribution Quantiles, the spot price is now above the 95th percentile level at $107.4k.
This model is particularly useful for identifying potential market top formation periods. A sharp upward move above the 95th quantile often triggers heightened profit realization by an increasingly larger base of holders, which eventually leads to a redistribution of supply up to higher acquisition prices. Given enough of this sell-side activity, it can create a top-heavy structure, with many investors having an elevated cost basis, which makes for an increasingly price-sensitive investor base.
Live Chart
Transitioning Towards Overheated Conditions
After reaching a new all-time high of $122.6k, Bitcoin prices then pulled back to $115.9k, a move that aligns with growing investor sell-side pressure into market strength. This reaction came after the market briefly rallied above $120k, which corresponds with a +1 standard deviation move above the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis.
Historically, this level often acts as a natural resistance, especially during periods of heightened speculative momentum. Assuming current momentum remains strong, the next key resistance lies at the +2 standard deviation band, which is currently trading around $136k.
Live Chart
A Compass For A Bull
Having established that the market has just entered into a near-term overheated condition, the remainder of this report will focus on key indicators that can help identify extremely high-risk market structures. Employing these metrics, we aim to outline the conditions that typically precede major tops or sharp corrections.
To gauge the profit dominance among recent investors, we turn to the Percent of Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit. This metric currently sits at 95%, which is more than 1 standard deviation above its long-term mean of 88%, and signals that newer market participants are enjoying a meaningful surge in unrealized profits.
This is the third breakout above this threshold since early May 2025, reinforcing the view that the market is entering a more euphoric state. If this metric begins to stabilize or decline below the 88% level, it could be an early signal of weakening demand or distribution taking hold.
Live Chart
To assess the degree of unrealized profit held by these investors, we turn to the Short-Term Holder Relative Unrealized Profit metric. This indicator just touched the overheated threshold at 15.4% (+1 standard deviation above the mean), before contracting to 13.6%, reflecting an easing of unrealized gains during the price pull-back.
Historically, this zone often marks the beginning of top formation, which tends to unfold with a lag due to prolonged profit-taking by short-term holders. Since these investors tend to react quickly to price shifts, this metric is key for spotting early signs of demand exhaustion.
Live Chart
With unrealized profits already reaching overheated territory, it is reasonable to expect short-term holders to begin spending coins in profit at an accelerated pace. These events can be identified when the Percent of Spent Volume in Profit by short-term holders rises above the 1 standard deviation band.
This is a pattern which has historically preceded demand-side exhaustion. So far, we have experienced the first major wave of high-volume profit taking since the peak in late 2024.
Live Chart
In addition to the spent volume in profit, we can assess the intensity of realized gains using the Realized Profit to Loss Ratio. This metric recently spiked to 39.8, which is well above the +2 standard deviation threshold. It has since cooled down to 7.3, which is still elevated, but a far more modest level for bull market conditions.
Repeated breaches into the overheated zone can serve as a strong signal of extreme profit-taking activity, which ultimately acts to exhaust inflowing demand across the market.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin has broken to new ATHs, and has cleared above two major accumulation zones. This represents a significant market move, which tends to be followed a strong positive momentum. However, short-term holders, being the more price-sensitive cohort, are now seeing their unrealized profit reaching marginally overheated levels, making the incentive for them to sell and take profit increasingly likely.
So far, both the Percent of Spent Volume in Profit and the Realized Profit to Loss Ratio have signalled the first wave of excessive profit-taking since late-2024. Historically, such formations can signal the formation of a near-term top, and usually unfold over multiple waves of profit taking. This suggests there is still potential for another leg higher, possibly toward the +2 standard deviation level above the short-term holder cost basis, currently trading around ~$130k."

Bitcoin‚Äôs realized cap reaches the $1 Trillion mark for the first time. This is truly a monumental milestone for Bitcoin, highlighting its deep liquidity profile, and growing relevance on the macro stage.
All altcoin sectors are now outperforming Bitcoin across the last week, led most notably by Ethereum. This has resulted in an Altcoin Market Cap increase of +$216B over the past two weeks.
Open interest across the top altcoins has surged higher from $26B to $44B across the month of July. Elevated leverage tends to amplify both upside and downside volatility, and can contribute to a more reflexive and fragile market environment.
Ethereum has decisively broken through many key on-chain resistance levels including the Active Investor Price and True Market Mean. However, a substantial uptick in sell-side pressure is expected around the $4.5k region.

A Trillion Dollars
July has been an explosive month for Bitcoin, marked by a surge in upside volatility, with the price rallying from a weekly low of $105.4K to set a new all-time high of $122.7K. Near-term momentum has cooled off later in the week, and the Bitcoin price has been consolidating and coiling just below its ATH since then.
Live Chart
The significant price uptick has motivated a flurry of profit taking from existing holders, and an inflow of fresh demand from buyers. This is cumulatively tracked via the Realized Cap metric, which measures the cumulative USD liquidity stored in the asset.
This recent capital inflow has pushed Bitcoin‚Äôs realized cap above the $1 Trillion mark for the first time. This is truly a monumental milestone for Bitcoin, highlighting its deep liquidity profile, and growing relevance on the macro stage. The larger Bitcoin becomes, the more capital can be stored within it, and the larger size can be settled via transactions.
Live Chart
Altcoin Speculation Rises
With Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization continuing to expand, we turn our attention to how the broader digital asset ecosystem is responding to this recent performance. To evaluate this, we employ our Altseason Indicator, which will flag a positive result when the following conditions apply:
Bitcoin and Ethereum
are both consistently absorbing capital inflows on-chain.
Stablecoin supplies
are rising, signaling increased ‚Äúdry powder‚Äù on the sidelines.
Altcoin Market Cap
is showing upward momentum via a fast/slow moving average cross-over.
This framework is designed to capture the dynamics of capital rotation along the risk curve. As Bitcoin and Ethereum draw in capital, and stablecoin liquidity grows, conditions become increasingly favorable for capital to rotate into higher-risk altcoins. When this environment coincides with a momentum crossover in the aggregate Altcoin Market Cap, it indicates that capital is now actively flowing into altcoins and driving valuation expansion.
From the perspective of this model, Altseason conditions first emerged on July 9th and has remained in effect since, suggesting the ongoing redistribution of capital across the broader crypto landscape.
Live Chart
We can validate this observation by analyzing sector-level performance across the digital asset ecosystem over the past week. Bitcoin‚Äôs recent consolidation is evident, with price action remaining largely flat over the last week. By contrast, all other digital asset sectors are now outperforming, led most notably by Ethereum. This mechanic is a classic example of capital rotation along the risk-curve.
However, given Bitcoin‚Äôs outsized dominance within the ecosystem (over 64% dominance), any sustained weakness in its performance could pose headwinds for the altcoin market, potentially curbing the momentum of this broader rally.
Live in Token Suite
This trend is further reinforced when examining sector correlations. Nearly all altcoin sectors are now moving in close lockstep, reflecting a broad-based rally across the wider market, largely unanchored from any asset-specific fundamentals.
At the same time, correlations between altcoin sectors and Bitcoin have decreased significantly, highlighting a growing divergence in price behavior, and confirming the orthogonal nature of recent price action between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin ecosystem.
Live in Token Suite
The magnitude of the recent change in the Altcoin Market Cap has been quite significant, and we note a Market Cap increase of +$216B to altcoins over the past two weeks. This is one of the largest USD denominated upswing in the aggregate altcoin market cap, which adds further evidence to the presence of an ongoing altseason impulse.
Live Chart
Derivatives Explode
Now that we‚Äôve established there is a noteworthy uptick in the altcoin market, it becomes prudent to analyze its surrounding derivative markets to assess to further understand the current risk appetite of market participants.
The combined open interest across top altcoins (Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Doge) has experienced a substantial increase from the start of July, growing from $26B to a staggering $44B. This sharp rise in futures leverage reflects a clear acceleration in speculative activity, with traders increasingly opening leveraged positions.
Such conditions point to a degree of froth starting to form in the market, and may leave it more susceptible to sharp volatility. Elevated leverage tends to amplify both upside and downside volatility, and can contribute to a more reflexive and fragile market environment.
Live Chart
When evaluating this magnitude of aggregate open interest growth, we find that recent daily increases have remained above the +2 standard deviation threshold for more than 12 consecutive days, the longest stretch on record.
This not only emphasizes the significant scale of recent open interest expansion, but also its persistence, potentially signaling a meaningful shift in speculative behavior among market participants.
Live Chart
The cumulative monthly funding premium paid by long-side futures contracts over the past 30 days can be a useful gauge for speculative appetite. Here, we look at monthly premium paid across the top altcoin assets, and we find that the total cost of leverage has reached approximately $32.9M/month.
This figure is comparable to the ~$42M/month observed during Bitcoin‚Äôs March 2024 all-time high, though it remains below the peak euphoria of ~$70M/month seen around the initial $100K breakout in late 2024.
This elevated funding cost signals that there is a meaningful increase in demand for leveraged long exposure, highlighting that market participants are becoming increasingly optimistic and aggressive in their positioning.
Live Chart
When evaluating open interest dominance, it's clear that leveraged positions in Ethereum have been expanding at a significantly faster pace than those in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Open Interest Dominance: 62%
Ethereum Open Interest Dominance: 38%
Ethereum open interest dominance is now inflecting higher, underscoring a noteworthy rotation in the focus of the market. Capital and speculative activity is increasingly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin at the margins.
To illustrate the significance of this trend, Ethereum‚Äôs open interest dominance has now reached its highest level since April 2023, with only 5% of trading days recording a higher value, and marking it as a notable event and a signal of heightened speculative engagement.
Live Chart
This trend is even more pronounced when assessing the volume dominance between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interestingly, Ethereum perpetual volume dominance has just overtaken Bitcoin for the first time since the 2022 cycle low, and is the largest volume skew in Ethereum‚Äôs favour on record.
Such a meaningful rotation of trade volume further confirms the scale of the rotation towards the altcoin sector, which has struggled for many months to attract speculative interest.
Live Chart
Ethereum Market Navigation
With Ethereum surging in price and leading a wider altcoin rally, we can focus in on Ethereum on-chain data to map out key pricing levels of interest
By examining Ethereum‚Äôs Cost-Basis Distribution profile, we note that there is a significant concentration of investor cost basis levels around the $2,400-$2,800 level. The price has decisively broken out above this dense cluster of supply, and is now trading in a region with comparatively fewer coins held at these price levels.
Investors who last acquired ETH tokens within the $2,400-$2,800 are now beginning to distribute them, with the $3,800 region emerging as a location where many are opting to take chips off of the table.
Live Chart
We can find confluence between several on-chain valuation models for Ethereum, and volume profile data. Specifically, the True Market Mean and Active Realized Price provide two adjusted cost-basis models which exclude long-dormant and lost coins. These adjustments offer a clearer picture of the average price paid by economically active investors compared to the realized price, which is the average cost basis per unit of ETH.
True Market Mean: $2,500
Active Realized Price: $3,000
Realized Price: $2,100
Notably, these valuation anchors bound the dense coin distribution seen in the CBD metric above. This alignment bolsters the observation that Ethereum has now broken out of an important psychological price range. It is also likely that this price range would serve as an important level of level of support in the event that price corrects back towards it.
Live Chart
In order to gauge upside targets for this ETH rally, we can turn to the +1 standard deviation band of Ethereum‚Äôs Active Realized Price. This acts as a threshold for where sell-side pressure may begin to intensify. Currently, this +1œÉ level sits at $4,500, and would be considered an overheated zone given current market conditions.
In the current cycle, this price band has already served as a resistance level back in March 2024, as well as during the prior 2020-21 cycle. Breakouts above this threshold tend to coincide with heightened market euphoria, and unsustainable market structure.
As such, $4,500 can be identified as a critical level to watch on the upside, especially if Ethereum‚Äôs uptrend continues and speculative froth builds further.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
With the altcoin sector having largely underperformed throughout this cycle, the recent spike in performance marks a notable shift in investor behavior. This is particularly evident in the perpetual futures landscape, where Ethereum's perpetual contract dominance has reached an all-time high, surpassing Bitcoin for the first time since the 2022 cycle low.
The surge in attention has spilled over into derivatives markets, with combined open interest across major altcoins (ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE) climbing from $26B to $44B in July alone. This rapid growth suggests an acceleration in speculative positioning and a rising degree of market froth. Elevated leverage can both magnify gains and exacerbate losses, introducing greater reflexivity and making the market more vulnerable to volatility shocks."
2025,30,2025-W30,2025-07-21,2025-07-27,Bullish,117428.79,119465.52,118533.02,1.73,Agree,"Executive Summary
Over the weekend, Bitcoin‚Äôs liquidity faced a significant test, as a large size early investor distributed over 80k BTC via Galaxy Digital‚Äôs OTC services. Despite this $9.6B in sell-side volume, the market absorbed the sell-side pressure efficiently, driving the price down to $115K before shortly stabilizing at $119K, just below the ATH.
Even after this large distribution event, the magnitude of unrealized profit held by market participants remains strong. Over $1.4T in paper gains are currently held, with 97% of the circulating supply still in profit.
According to several on-chain valuation models, Bitcoin remains range-bound between $105K and $125K. A decisive breakout above this range could open the door to a move toward $141K, an area likely to see increased sell-side pressure given the high unrealized profit expected at those levels.

Deeply Liquid
The Realized Cap is a foundational metric in on-chain analytics, quantifying the total USD-denominated liquidity stored within the Bitcoin network. As of now, it stands at over $1.02T, underscoring the asset's immense and growing liquidity profile and market depth.
This liquidity was put to the test over the weekend, as an early Bitcoin investor, via Galaxy Digital‚Äôs services, distributed 80k BTC (~$9.6B), likely through a mix of market sales and OTC transactions. The resulting sell-side pressure drove the price down to $115K, before stabilizing at $119K.
This episode illustrates Bitcoin's ability to absorb large sell-side volumes, even during typically thinner weekend trading hours, reinforcing the market's structural robustness.
Live Chart
Consequently, this event catalyzed a significant spike in the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which reached an all-time high of $3.7B. Notably, the spike preceded the weekend sell-off and reflected the movement of coins in advance of the final distribution.
Since the original cluster of coins had been flagged by entity-adjustment heuristics as part of an internal transfer, subsequent movements from those addresses via Galaxy Digital were then recorded as economically meaningful transactions, and a changing of hands.
Live Chart
The recent influx of profit-taking has driven a sharp acceleration in the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, with realized profits now exceeding losses by a multiple of 571. This is considered to be a highly elevated level, surpassed by only 1.5% of trading days.
However, interpreting this signal requires nuance. While extreme profit-taking can coincide with price tops, as observed at the $73K all-time high in March 2024, this isn‚Äôt always immediate. For example, during the $100K breakout in late-2024, profit-taking peaked when the price was at $98K, however the market continued to climb another 10% before finally peaking at $107K.
This lag suggests that significantly elevated profit taking volumes often precede, but don‚Äôt always instantly cause, market exhaustion. It acts as supply which must be absorbed, and this can take time before the market fully responds.
Live Chart
Time in the Market
Following the absorption of a substantial tranche of long-dormant coins, the Long-Term Holder Net Realized Profit/Loss has surged to a new all-time high of $2.5B, surpassing the previous peak of $1.6B. This marks the single largest sell-side pressure event in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, an immense liquidity stress test, yet the market has remained remarkably resilient, with price holding just below its all-time high.
It stands as further evidence of the extraordinary capacity of the Bitcoin market to withstand intense distribution phases, following on from other major events this cycle such as the Mt. Gox repayments and German government BTC sales.
Live Chart
When comparing the ratio between Long and Short-Term Holder supply, a recurring pattern has emerged across all three ATH formations this cycle, with an initial phase of accumulation, followed by a sharp pivot into aggressive distribution.
Currently, this distribution phase remains underway, as the LTH/STH supply ratio continues to contract. Over the past 30 days, the ratio has declined by -11%, with only 8.6% of trading days registering a more severe drawdown, underscoring the intensity of the shift in investor behavior.
Live Chart
Unrealized Profits
Despite the significant wave of sell-side pressure over the weekend, including substantial profit-taking by long-term investors, the Bitcoin market has remained remarkably stable. As a result, a super-majority of participants still hold their coins at a meaningful unrealized profit, with over 97% of the circulating supply still held, despite spot prices trading above their original acquisition price.
Live Chart
The total dollar value of paper gains across all market participants, called unrealized profits, recently reached an all-time high of $1.4T in aggregate. This underscores how the majority of investors are sitting on substantial paper gains, and sets up an environment of potential future sell-side pressure should prices continue to rise further.
Live Chart
We can also assess Unrealized Profit as a percentage of market cap, offering a normalized view over time, as both profit held, and the asset size grow in tandem.
Currently, this metric is once again breaking above its +2œÉ band, a level that has historically aligned with periods of market euphoria and has coincided with each prior ATH formation. This further reinforces the idea that participants are sitting on substantial unrealized gains, even from a normalized perspective.
This would indicate that many investors are feeling quite positive about market conditions, acting as a tailwind for sentiment, but also a growing incentive to cash in on the road ahead.
Live Chart
One notable differentiator in this cycle compared to previous ones is that Long-Term Holders still retain a substantial share of network wealth, currently sitting at 53%.
This remains true despite the cohorts significant distribution throughout the cycle. This is further supported by a broader market environment where unrealized profit is already meaningfully elevated.
This overall dynamic suggests that there may still be room for additional Long-Term Holder distribution, and as prices rise towards levels which are compelling enough to unlock deeper pockets of dormant supply, it will require greater inflows of demand to absorb.
Live Chart
Market Navigation
By examining Bitcoin‚Äôs Cost-Basis Distribution profile, we can see a significant concentration of investor cost basis levels around the $117k-$122k region. This highlights a large volume of investor accumulation has taken place at this elevated price point.
Noticeably, there remains an air-gap of volume just beneath the spot price, from $115k to $110k, a result of price rallying through the region without much opportunity for coins to transact along the way.
Not all air-gaps like this one must be back-filled, but a gravity does exist there, and the market may want to re-confirm if support will step in. This marks this area as a key zone to watch in the event of a price pull back.
Live Chart
The Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, representing the average acquisition price for newer market participants, has historically served as a key threshold delineating between bullish and bearish local regimes. To add statistical context, we can apply standard deviation bands around the STH cost basis.
These dynamic price zones help identify areas of trend exhaustion or breakout potential.
STH CB +2œÉ: $141.6k
STH CB +1œÉ: $125.1k
STH Cost Basis: $105.4k
STH CB -1œÉ: $92.1k
A key observation is that Bitcoin continues to trade above the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis, which is a constructive signal for market strength. Additionally, price has consistently encountered resistance near the +1œÉ band across all major topping structures this cycle, with our current setup being no exception.
From a broader perspective, this suggests that Bitcoin may remain range-bound between $105K and $125K until a decisive breakout occurs. Should the market break convincingly higher, the $141K region is likely to present the next major zone of resistance where sell-side pressure may intensify rapidly, aligned with the +2œÉ band.
Live Chart
We can bolster our analysis of Short-Term Holder behavior by examining the cost basis of distinct sub-groups within the cohort. These sub-groups form a ""fast-to-slow"" ribbon of cost basis levels, effectively acting as a momentum-style indicator for short-term market sentiment.
As it stands, price remains elevated above the cost-basis of all short-term sub-cohorts, underscoring market strength despite the current stagnation and consolidation in price. Notably, the cost-basis range spanning from 24-hrs to 3-months falls between $110K and $117K, closely aligning with the light-volume zone identified in Bitcoin‚Äôs cost-basis distribution.
This confluence across several independent indicators reinforces the importance of this price region, suggesting it may act as a key support zone should the market experience a pullback.
Live Chart
To further inspect momentum within these the sub-cohorts, we can utilize an equal-weighted composite to measure the number of age-based cohorts which, on average, are holding their coins in profit. This aids us in visually observing the momentum of the market, by tracking when a growing share new investors are seeing their holdings move from an unrealized profit, into a state of unrealized loss.
The composite index has now held above its mean for an extended period, and continues to trend upward toward the +1œÉ level. This indicates that, at present, market momentum remains relatively strong, and the majority of new investors are likely feeling positive about current conditions.
Live Chart
Summary and Conclusions
Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience was significantly tested over the weekend as the market efficiently absorbed a $9.6B sell-side event from the distribution of 80k BTC, one of the largest discrete profit-taking events in its history. Despite the scale of this transaction, price quickly stabilized just below all-time highs, underscoring the depth and maturity of current market liquidity.
At present, Bitcoin remains range-bound between $105K and $125K. A confirmed breakout beyond this zone could shift market dynamics, bringing the $141K region into focus, an area where key on-chain metrics suggest profit-taking could sharply intensify. Conversely, a light volume zone sits just below the current price between $110K-$115K, marking it as a critical area to monitor should a market pullback occur."

After peaking above $123k in mid‚ÄëJuly, BTC has since entered a phase of indecision, with the price trading below the supply cluster with a base at $116k.
On July 31, price broke below the lower boundary of this cluster, slipping into a relatively low‚Äëliquidity ‚Äúair gap‚Äù, which persists down to $110k. Opportunistic buying has emerged, but the market is yet to reclaim key resistance levels.
Short‚Äëterm holder profitability has dropped, although around 70% of their supply is still held in profit. Without a quick rebound in demand, confidence amongst these new investors may start to weaken, prompting further sell pressure.
The ETFs experienced an outflow of ‚Äë1.5k BTC, which was the largest since April 2025.
Funding rates across major perpetual swap markets have slid lower, signalling a reduction in excess leverage and a reluctance to pay high premiums for opening new leveraged long positions.

Drifting Into An Air Gap
After reaching a new all-time high of $123k in mid-July, the market has since pulled back to $113k, putting many new investors underwater on their recent buys. This has formed a large supply cluster with a cost basis above $116k.
The lower bound of this cluster was tested multiple times prior to the market breaking lower, with each retest prompting a price rebound and finding support. However, on 31 July, the price broke decisively below this support level, entering the ‚Äúair gap‚Äù highlighted in WoC 30.
Historically, such low-liquidity price ranges often evolve into new accumulation zones, as opportunistic buyers step in to acquire BTC at a perceived discount to the latest ATH.
Live Chart
To evaluate how aggressively opportunistic buyers stepped in after the price slipped lower, we can compare the Entity-Adjusted URPD as of 31 July to that of 4 August.
The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) maps out where the set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created as of that date, with each bar showing the volume of supply which last moved within each specific price bucket.
This comparison shows that after rebounding from a low of ~$112k, roughly ~120k BTC was acquired by investors, suggesting buy-the-dip behaviour by investors, and pushing the price back above $114k.
However, this air gap between $110k and $116k remains relatively light in terms of aggregate supply, and a period of accumulation within this zone could, over time, establish a sufficiently strong base to support the next move higher.
Live Chart
A Decisive New Resistance
Despite the accumulation which has occurred over the last week, the market rebound has thus far lacked sufficient strength to reclaim the cost basis of local top buyers who entered over the past month. For this 1w‚Äì1m holder cohort, their cost basis now acts as a resistance level, and is located around 116.9k.
A sustained price move above this threshold would signal that the demand side is regaining control and offer early confirmation that the market has found its footing. Conversely, if the price remains below this level for a longer period, it increases the risk of a deeper correction, likely toward the lower bound of the air gap near $110k.
Live Chart
Bull/Bear Frontline
Zooming out, we can construct a set of statistical bands derived from the short-term holder cost basis, which can provide a compass for navigating the current market structure.
The Bitcoin price is currently trading within the warm, but not overheated zone, and is still above the short-term holder cost basis located at $106k. This setup is quite normal for a Bitcoin bull market, and the STH cost basis historically serves as an important threshold separating near-term bullish and bearish trends.
Live Chart
Profitability Around The Mid-line
Given the market is currently within a typical post-ATH corrective phase, we can utilize indicators of on-chain investor behaviour to gauge where short-term biases may be leaning. First, we examine how the profitability of new investors has changed, as this reflects a primary driver of their confidence in the trend and a key determinant of their next decision.
For short-term holders, the percent of their supply held in profit has declined from 100% to 70% during this price pull-back. This is a level which aligns with the midline of prior bull phases, and is again not an atypical condition.
The deeper the correction, the more supply is likely to fall into loss, which can slowly erode investor confidence. However, given the market is trading within a relatively thin air-gap, the most likely source of this additional supply would be from late-stage profit-taking, should it occur.
Live Chart
A Need for New Demand
To assess how this pullback has influenced investor behaviour, we turn to the percent of spent volume originating from short-term holders who were in profit. This metric directly measures the number of recently acquired coins that are taking profit.
The proportion of STH spent coins which are taking profit has cooled off, and trading at 45%, which is below the neutral threshold.
Overall, this suggests the market is in a relatively balanced position, with 70% of STH supply still held in profit, and an almost even split of profit and loss taking in coins which are on the move.
Live Chart
ETF Outflows Create Sell-side Pressure
To bolster our on-chain dominant analysis thus far, we can view these metrics alongside demand from traditional vehicles via the ETFs. On August 5, the ETFs experienced a fairly sizeable outflow of -1.5k BTC, marking the largest wave of sell-side pressure from these vehicles since April 2025.
To date, outflows from the ETFs have been relatively brief events, with few instances of sustained sell-side pressure. Keeping an eye on these flows will help to identify whether this outflow is just another example of this dynamic or perhaps a more structural shift in sentiment.
Live Chart
Funding Rates Pull Back
Looking beyond the spot market, sentiment in perpetual futures is also moving away from a brief dance with euphoric levels. Both the aggregated and individual component funding rates across all perpetual swap markets for Bitcoin have come off the recent highs and are now trading back below the 0.1% range.
This territory is often considered to be fairly neutral, reflecting a lack of appetite amongst the bulls to pay a large premium for leveraged long positions. Such a shift suggests a marked cooling down of speculative interest and reduced upside conviction in the near term.
Live Chart
Conclusion
The Bitcoin market is navigating a post‚ÄëATH correction. The Bitcoin price has slipped below the $116k accumulation range low and entered a low‚Äëliquidity ‚Äúair gap‚Äù, first highlighted in earlier reports. Opportunistic buying has emerged, but demand has not yet been strong enough to reclaim the cost basis of recent buyers, leaving this level as a critical pivot for near‚Äëterm direction.
Investor behaviour signals a relatively balanced environment, with several Short-Term Holder-based metrics trading at levels which are quite consistent with a typical bull market trend. The ETFs have experienced a large outflow; however, to date, these have been brief events, and there isn‚Äôt sufficient evidence to suggest a more structural trend of outflows is in play.
The market is effectively re-finding its footing, bounded by the previous cycle ATH of $110k below, and the base of the most recent accumulation range near $116k."

Ethereum‚Äôs rally continues to accelerate, with the asset reaching $4.3k, its highest price since December 2021 and just -12.5% below its prior all-time high. However, growing speculation in the leading altcoin has driven open interest across the top altcoins to a combined record of $47B. This buildup of leverage creates a more volatile backdrop, with markets becoming increasingly reflexive to price shocks.
Bitcoin momentum remains robust across key on-chain indicators. Short-Term Holder realized losses during the recent pullback to $112K were notably subdued, while the vast majority of investors remain in a profitable position.
Options traders continue to price in a low-volatility regime, with at-the-money implied volatility (IV) across all tenors at multi-year lows. Historically, periods of exceptionally low IV have preceded sharp expansions in realized volatility, acting as a contrarian signal.
Ethereum is approaching the +1œÉ Active Realized Price level at $4.7k, a zone that has historically triggered heightened sell-side pressure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is nearing its +1œÉ Short-Term Holder cost-basis at $127K, a level that has consistently acted as cycle resistance, where a decisive breakout could open the path toward the +2œÉ level at $144K.

Altcoins Rally
Momentum in digital asset markets continues to accelerate, with Ethereum at the forefront. The asset has climbed from $1.5K in April to $4.3K, its highest level since December 2021 and only 12.5% below its all-time high of $4.8K. Historically, Ethereum has served as a bellwether for broader altcoin performance, and its recent strength is now fueling increased speculation further along the risk curve.
Live Chart
This rotation of capital is also reflected in the Bitcoin Dominance metric, which tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs share of total digital asset market capitalization. Over the past two months, dominance has fallen from 65% to 59%, underscoring an ongoing shift of capital further along the risk curve.
Live Chart
When examining the 7-day percentage change across the top altcoins (Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin), we observe several periods of strong performance throughout July and August.
Ethereum 7-Day % Change: +25.5%
XRP 7-Day % Change: +16.2%
Solana 7-Day % Change: +13.6%
Dogecoin 7-Day % Change: +25.5%
These moves underscore the broad-based rise in altcoins as speculative activity among investors continues to intensify.
Live Chart
Another method to measure the performance of top altcoins is to construct a market-cap-weighted basket of the top altcoins and assess its 7-day log returns, which naturally account for scale differences across the various assets.
By applying ¬±1œÉ bands to the return series, we can identify periods of statistically significant over or underperformance. Across the past four months, this approach reveals three sustained periods of statistically strong performance, highlighting the outsized returns in the altcoin sector.
Live Chart
The pronounced price action across the top altcoins has driven a surge in open interest across the group, reaching a new all-time high of $47B. These conditions highlight a degree of leverage developing in the market, leaving it more vulnerable to sharp price swings. Elevated leverage can amplify both upward and downward moves, creating a more reflexive and fragile market environment.
Live Chart
Inflection Point
In contrast, Bitcoin, which has consistently outperformed most altcoins throughout the cycle, faced a challenging second half of July, experiencing a -9% drawdown as price fell to $112k and entered the low-liquidity air gap highlighted in
WoC 30
. Since then, the asset has staged a strong recovery and now sits just -1% below its all-time high, signaling a renewed attempt to enter a fresh phase of price discovery.
Live Chart
The recent push in upward momentum is supported by strong on-chain fundamentals. The percentage of the circulating supply in a position of profit has remained resilient throughout the correction, finding support at its +1œÉ level. This suggests that a supermajority of investors (95%) continue to hold unrealized gains and remain in a profitable position.
Live Chart
During the recent market downturn, the Short-Term Holder SOPR, which measures the aggregate profit or loss multiple across all coins transacted within this cohort, has reverted to its equilibrium level of 1.0, with only brief and shallow dips below it. This pattern suggests that newer investors have been actively defending their cost basis, and that realized losses remained relatively limited despite the sharp deterioration in market structure.
Live Chart
Additionally, we can employ an equal-weighted composite to measure the proportion of age-based cohorts that are on average, holding their coins in profit. This provides a visual gauge of market momentum by tracking when a growing share investors see their holdings shift from unrealized profit to unrealized loss.
The oscillator has held above its mean throughout the recent correction, finding strong support at that level, indicating that most investors remained profitable during the drawdown. Coupled with the marginal losses reflected in the STH-SOPR metric, this suggests minimal capitulation pressure among market participants. The preservation of this threshold signals improving market conditions and supports a constructive backdrop for continued momentum.
Live Chart
Implied Volatility Continues to Contract
Moving towards options markets, at-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV) remains in a sustained downtrend, suggesting traders are not yet anticipating a shift to a high-volatility regime. Historically, such subdued volatility expectations have often preceded sharp market moves, making them a potential contrarian indicator.
Live Chart
Furthermore, we can bolster our above observation by additionally exploring Deribit‚Äôs DVOL index, a 30-day implied volatility measure derived from the full range of option strikes rather than only at-the-money levels. Similar to the equity market‚Äôs VIX, it provides a broad view of market sentiment and expected price movement, helping traders gauge risk and spot periods of heightened speculation or uncertainty.
Current DVOL readings are historically low, with only 2.6% of trading days registering a lower value. Such levels often reflect market complacency and limited demand for hedging against large moves. While these conditions can persist, they leave the market exposed to sudden volatility spikes if a catalyst emerges, as past cycles have shown through sharp, disorderly price swings when risk is rapidly repriced.
Live Chart
Additionally, we can track the 6M/1M IV ratio to gauge how the market‚Äôs volatility expectations shift across time. Changes in this slope can reveal whether traders see risk concentrated in the near term or building further out, helping identify shifts in sentiment and the timing of anticipated market stress or euphoria.
Currently, the 6M/1M IV ratio is steep, with only 3.2% of trading days recording a higher reading. This indicates that options traders are pricing significantly greater uncertainty in the longer term than in the near term, pointing to substantially elevated volatility expectations over the next two quarters.
Live Chart
Market Navigation
To assess potential upside targets for Ethereum‚Äôs current rally, one useful reference point is the +1 standard deviation level of its Active Realized Price, often marking where selling pressure starts to build. At present, the threshold resides at the $4.7k, which under current market conditions would likely represent an overheated area.
This level has historical significance, acting as a ceiling during the March 2024 rally and also serving as resistance multiple times in the 2020‚Äì21 bull cycle. When Ethereum has pushed above this band in the past, it has typically been accompanied by elevated investor exuberance and fragile market structures.
Given these dynamics, the $4.7k price point stands out as a key resistance to monitor. A decisive break above could signal the onset of a more speculative phase, but also increase the risk of a sharp reversal if sentiment turns.
Live Chart
Conversely, for Bitcoin, we can evaluate the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, which represents the average acquisition price of newer market participants, with this key pricing level historically marking a boundary between bullish and bearish local regimes. Adding statistical context, we can apply standard deviation bands around this level to assess for over or underheated conditions.
From the perspective of these pricing levels, the $127k level becomes a critical to level to monitor the reaction of price in the event of further upside, and is likely the first significant resistance point to overcome. Additionally, a decisive move above $127k would likely bring the $144K area into consideration, where the +2œÉ band aligns with a major resistance zone and could trigger a sharp increase in sell-side pressure.

Summary and Conclusions
Strength in digital asset markets continues to persist with Ethereum surging to $4.3k, its highest value since December 2021 and now only -12.5% below its all-time high, whilst Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum remains firmly supported by resilient on-chain strength.
Strong altcoin price action has fueled a surge in open interest across the top altcoins, which has climbed to a record $47B, increasing the potential for sharper, more reflexive price moves. In contrast, Bitcoin options markets remain priced for a low-volatility environment, with implied volatility at multi-year lows, a setup that has historically preceded abrupt expansions in realized volatility.
Both majors are now approaching historically important resistance markers: Ethereum at the +1œÉ Active Realized Price of $4.7k and Bitcoin at the +1œÉ Short-Term Holder cost basis of $127K. Price developments at these thresholds are likely to be pivotal in determining whether markets extend toward higher cycle targets or face a sharper, leverage-driven retracement."

Capital inflows into Bitcoin continue to decline, despite the formation of a new ATH at $124.4k. This softer period of capital inflow highlights the notably lighter appetite of demand from investors at this stage.
As Bitcoin reached a price ATH, open interest across the major altcoins has reached an ATH of $60B, highlighting the elevated degree of leverage in the market. However, this was short lived, and was followed by a -$2.6B decline as prices corrected lower, creating the 10th largest drop on record.
Ethereum has generally been considered a bellweather asset, with periods of its out-performance usually correlated with broader a ‚Äúaltseason‚Äù phase in the digital asset market. Notably, Ethereum‚Äôs open interest dominance has reached its 4th largest level on record, whilst perpetual futures volume dominance has surged to a new all-time high of 67%.
When we examine Bitcoin‚Äôs performance from each cycle low, we can see that in both the 2015‚Äì2018 and 2018‚Äì2022 cycles, the all-time highs were reached roughly 2‚Äì3 months beyond where we are in the current cycle, by relative timing.

Capital Flows Slow
Following the formation of a $124.4K high last week, Bitcoin's upward momentum has stalled, with price retracing to a low of $112.9K, a near -9.2% pullback. This decline has been accompanied by noticeably weaker capital inflows over recent weeks, suggesting that investors were unwilling to inject fresh capital at those elevated price levels.
When we compare the current rate of capital inflows to the previous ATH breakouts, the realized cap has increased by a substantially smaller percentage than it did during the March and December ATHs in 2024. The initial $100k breakout in late-2024 saw the realized cap rate of increase hitting +13% per month, whilst the current environment peaked at a far more modest +6%/month.
This softer period of capital inflow highlights the notably lighter appetite of demand from investors at this stage.
Live Chart
Profit taking activity has also declined in recent weeks, which we can visualize using the Volatility-Adjusted Net Realized Profit/Loss metric. This tool measures realized profit and loss in BTC terms, which normalizes it relative to Bitcoin‚Äôs growing market cap across cycles. It is further refined by adjusting for 7-day realized volatility, to account for Bitcoin‚Äôs diminishing returns and slower growth rate as the asset matures.
Notably, we can observe three bursts of substantial profit taking around the $70K and $100K breakouts in 2024, as well as the last $122K ATH, hit in July this year. These events signalled a strong appetite for investors to lock in large volumes of profit, but also an equally strong impulse of demand to absorb that sold supply.
In contrast, this latest all-time high attempt has seen realized profit-taking volumes decline markedly. One interpretation of this dynamic, is that the market failed to sustain upwards momentum, even though the sell-side pressure coming from existing holders was softer.
Live Chart
As local market momentum reverses, and price continues trending lower, we turn our attention to realized loss events, to assess for any substantial negative changes in investor sentiment. Through this local downtrend, investor loss taking has accelerated, reaching a value of $112M/day.
However, this remains within the typical range seen during local corrections throughout the bull cycle, with many events such as the Aug-2024 yen-carry unwind, and the ‚ÄòTrump Tariff Tantrum‚Äô in Mar-Apr-2025 leading to substantially higher capitulation volumes.
This suggests that the prevailing downturn has not put a meaningful dent in investor confidence just yet, although elevated losses would start working against that idea.
Live Chart
A Leverage Driven Decline
Whilst on-chain profit and loss-taking remained relatively muted during the recent ATH formation and the following correction, activity in the futures markets has accelerated. Open interest across Bitcoin futures contracts remains elevated at $67B, highlighting the high degree of leverage currently in play.
Notably, over -$2.3B in open interest was unwound during the recent sell-off, with only 23 trading days recording a larger nominal decline. This underscores the speculative nature of the market, where even moderate price movements can trigger a significant contraction in leveraged positions.
Live Chart
Diving deeper, we can evaluate the scale of combined long and short liquidations during both the ATH formation and the subsequent price contraction.
While liquidation volumes did rise during these events, with shorts reaching $74M across the ATH, and longs hitting $99M during the downtrend, these levels remain noticeably lower than those seen during similar volatile price moves this year. This suggests that a significant portion of recent contract closures were likely voluntary, and therefore risk-managed, rather than driven by forced liquidations as excessive leverage is flushed out.
Live Chart
When we evaluate futures open interest across the the major altcoins (ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE), we note that the combined total has surged to a new all-time high of $60.2B over the weekend. This is nearing a parity of scale with open interest in Bitcoin contracts. However, this was short lived, and was followed by a -$2.6B decline as prices corrected lower, creating the 10th largest drop on record.
These rapid fluctuations underscore that altcoins are currently drawing a significant amount of investor attention, and have meaningfully contributed to heightened reflexivity and fragility across digital asset markets.
Live Chart
In addition, combined liquidations across the major altcoins have been quite elevated of late, reaching a peak of $303M/day, and experienced more than twice the liquidation volume compared to the Bitcoin futures market.
Furthermore, the scale of liquidations over the weekend now rank as the 15th largest on record, showcasing a heightened appetite for leveraged exposure to the altcoin landscape.
Live Chart
Speculation Intensifies
Over the years, Ethereum has generally been considered a bellweather asset, with periods of its out-performance usually correlated with broader a ‚Äúaltseason‚Äù phase in the digital asset market.
This relationship can also be observed through the lens of open interest dominance between Bitcoin and Ethereum, which reflects shifting risk appetite amongst market participants. As it stands today;
Bitcoin Open Interest Dominance: 56.7%
Ethereum Open Interest Dominance: 43.3%
Ethereum‚Äôs share of open interest has been climbing rapidly of late, signaling a meaningful rotation of market attention further out on the risk curve. Notably, Ethereum‚Äôs open interest dominance has reached its 4th largest level on record, which underscores a meaningful rise in speculative activity. It is important to note, that being the second largest digital asset, Ethereum is one of the few that can take on institutional sized capital.
Live Chart
This trend becomes even more striking when viewed through the lens of trading volume. Ethereum‚Äôs perpetual futures volume dominance has surged to a new all-time high of 67%, being the strongest shift on record.
Such a pronounced rotation in trading activity reinforces the growing focus of investors on the altcoin sector, and points towards an acceleration of risk appetite within this market cycle.
Live Chart
At A Crossroads
When we examine Bitcoin‚Äôs performance from each cycle low, we can see that in both the 2015‚Äì2018 and 2018‚Äì2022 cycles, the all-time highs were reached roughly 2‚Äì3 months beyond where we are in the current cycle, by relative timing.
While these are the only two prior examples of a semi-mature cycle, and therefore do not provide a sufficient basis to assume this synchronicity will persist, this remains a noteworthy data-point. This perspective is particularly relevant when considered against the backdrop of the waves of on-chain profit-taking over the past two years, and the elevated levels of speculative activity visible in derivatives markets today.
Live Chart
To further support this observation, we can look at the duration in which the percentage of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating supply has remained above the +1 standard deviation band in each cycle.
In the current cycle, this period has now extended to 273 days, making it the second-longest on record, surpassed only by the 2015‚Äì2018 cycle at 335 days. This suggests that, when measured from the perspective of a super-majority of supply being held in profit, the present cycle has delivered a comparable duration to prior cycles.
Live Chart
We can also measure the cumulative profit realized (in BTC terms) by long-term holders, from the point of reaching a new cycle all-time high, until the final peak of the cycle. From this perspective, we find that the LTH cohort, which are typically most active at cycle extremes, has already realized more profit than in all but one of the prior cycles, with the exception being 2016‚Äì2017.
This observation aligns with the earlier metric, adding another dimension through the lens of sell-side pressure. Taken together, these signals reinforce the view that the current cycle is firmly in its historically late phase.
However, each cycle carries its own idiosyncrasies, and there is no guarantee that market behavior will adhere to this fixed temporal pattern.
Nevertheless, these dynamics raise an interesting question. Does the traditional four-year cycle continue to hold, or are we witnessing its evolution? These are questions that will be answered over the months ahead.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Capital inflows into Bitcoin are showing signs of fatigue, with demand softening even as price set a new ATH at $124.4k. This slowing appetite has coincided with a surge in speculative positioning, as open interest across major altcoins briefly reached a record high of $60B before correcting with a -$2.5B decline.
Ethereum, long regarded as a bellwether for ‚Äúaltseason,‚Äù is once again at the forefront of this rotation. Its open interest dominance has climbed to its 4th largest level on record, while perpetual futures volume dominance has surged to a new ATH of 67%, marking the strongest structural shift to date.
From a cyclical perspective, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action also echoes prior patterns. In both the 2015‚Äì2018 and 2018‚Äì2022 cycles, ATHs occurred only 2‚Äì3 months beyond where we currently stand when measured from the cycle low. Alongside this, long-term holders have realized profit levels comparable to past euphoric phases, reinforcing the impression of a market late in its cycle.
Taken together, these signals highlight elevated leverage, profit-taking, and speculative intensity, hallmarks of historically mature market phases. However, each cycle carries its own idiosyncrasies, and there is no certainty that Bitcoin and the broader market will conform to a fixed temporal blueprint."
2025,34,2025-W34,2025-08-18,2025-08-24,Bearish,116286.76,113478.00,114524.26,-2.42,Agree,"Executive Summary
Bitcoin has pulled back to $111k, with support anchored by the $93k‚Äì$110k cost basis cluster. A break below $107k‚Äì$108.9k could open downside toward $93k‚Äì$95k.
Short-term holders remain under stress, making $113.6k a likely resistance as they sell into any bounce.
Unrealized and realized losses remain shallow, far from past bear extremes, suggesting limited capitulation so far.
Spot demand has neutralized, while perpetual futures lean bearish, with funding rates signalling fragile neutrality.

.
Filling the Gap
The market enters its second week of retracement from the $124k all-time high, raising the question of whether this is merely a short pause or the start of a deeper contraction. To frame this discussion, we turn to price models, beginning with the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) Heatmap.
The CBD Heatmap provides a visualization of supply concentration across different acquisition prices, highlighting where significant portions of coins last changed hands. Each band of colour reflects dense regions of cost basis, which often act as natural support or resistance zones.
At present, Bitcoin trades near $111k, hovering just above the lower edge of the ‚Äúair gap‚Äù highlighted in earlier reports. This latest pullback has allowed for the redistribution of supply at discounted prices, gradually filling in the gap. Notably, a thick cluster of supply between $93k and $110k has been forming since December 2024, steadily maturing into a potential floor.
This accumulation helps explain the ongoing resilience above $110k, suggesting that further correction would require either significant short-term sell pressure or a longer demand pause sufficient to frustrate these investors into capitulation
Live Chart
Testing the Patience of New Buyers
To better gauge the frustration within the market, we turn to the cost basis of recent investors. This metric captures the average acquisition price of coins held by cohorts who entered within the past 1 to 6 months, serving as a psychological benchmark. When the market trades below these levels, it often signals that newer holders are slipping into unrealized loss, a state that can provoke impatience and selling pressure.
Currently, Bitcoin trades beneath the cost basis of both the 1-month ($115.6k) and 3-month ($113.6k) cohorts, leaving these investors under stress. Any relief rally is therefore likely to encounter resistance, as short-term holders seek to exit at breakeven.
More critically, the 6-month cost basis sits near ~$107k. A sustained move below this level risks triggering fear, which could accelerate downside momentum toward the lower edge of the supporting supply cluster highlighted in the CBD Heatmap.
Live Chart
Speculating the Mid-Term Risk
If the current weakness extends and price continues to trade beneath the cost basis of short-term holders near $108.9k, history suggests caution is warranted. In past cycles, such breaks have often preceded multi-month bearish phases, as newer investors capitulated under mounting unrealized losses.
Framing this risk through the 4-year statistical bands, prior bearish drawdowns typically found their eventual lows around one standard deviation beneath the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis. For the present cycle, this lower bound is estimated near $95.1k. Thus, should Bitcoin fail to regain footing above the $107k‚Äì$108.9k threshold, the mid-term range for a potential bottom formation likely resides in the $93k‚Äì$95k zone, aligning with the dense cluster of support highlighted earlier in the CBD Heatmap.
Live Chart
Past Cyclical Bears
To put the current level of pain into perspective, we can compare today‚Äôs market structure with prior cyclical extremes. Historically, bear markets have been marked by severe drawdowns that either defined mid-cycle resets or full-blown capitulation events.
So far, the recent decline to $110.1k represents an ~11.4% drawdown from the $124k all-time high. This is notably modest compared to prior mid-cycle bears, which typically exceeded 25%, or the deep cyclical lows that saw losses greater than 75%. In this context, the intensity of the ongoing correction remains relatively shallow and does not yet resemble the stress profiles seen in historical extremes.
Live Chart
Gauging Pain Through Unrealized Losses
Another way to size the current correction is through Relative Unrealized Loss, which measures the share of the market‚Äôs aggregate losses relative to market cap. This metric highlights the scale of stress investors are experiencing compared to prior cycles.
Since November 2023, Relative Unrealized Loss has largely stayed below the -0.5 standard deviation level, around 5%, never approaching the depths observed during the prolonged bear markets of 2018‚Äì2020 or 2022‚Äì2023.
At present, with Bitcoin trading near $111k, the metric stands at just 0.5%, massively lower than the loss levels typically associated with deep bear phases (>30%). This perspective reinforces the earlier conclusion that although recent drawdowns have frustrated short-term holders, the magnitude of unrealized pain across the broader market remains far from historical extremes.
Live Chart
Realizing the Pain
While unrealized losses offer one lens into investor stress, it is equally important to observe how much of that paper loss is actually being realized on-chain. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) provides this insight by measuring the ratio between the price at which coins are spent and their cost basis. Values above 1 imply profits are being realized, whereas values below 1 indicate coins are being sold at a loss ‚Äî a sign of capitulation.
Currently, the 7-day moving average of the change-adjusted SOPR, which filters out internal transfers, is sitting near the neutral value of 1. This suggests that most active investors are neither realizing significant gains nor losses, a sign of uncertainty.
Historically, cyclical lows have only been confirmed when this metric fell below 0.98, marking widespread capitulation across the network. For now, the absence of such a signal indicates that, despite heightened anxiety, the market has yet to experience the deep realization of losses that define true bear market bottoms.
Live Chart
Spot Market Neutralizing
After establishing the statistical bounds of potential price outcomes through on-chain analysis, we can turn to off-chain data to assess sentiment from the perspective of exchange order books. A useful lens here is Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which tracks the net difference between trades initiated by buyers and sellers, then aggregates this imbalance into a cumulative signal.
To gauge shifts in spot market behaviour, we compare the 30-day moving average of CVD against its 180-day median. Across major venues like Coinbase and Binance, as well as aggregated exchange flows, this bias has recently converged toward zero. This represents a notable change from the strong buying pressure observed in April 2025, which fuelled the rebound from $72k. While a small positive spike in July helped drive the rally toward $124k, the broader trend now reflects a neutralization of spot sentiment, suggesting less conviction among buyers at the current level.
Live Chart
Perpetuals Leaning Bearish
In contrast to the neutral tone of the spot market, the picture in perpetual futures has shifted decisively bearish. Since July, the CVD bias across Binance, Bybit, and exchanges in aggregate has declined into negative territory, signalling a growing imbalance toward sell pressure. This suggests that perpetual traders, who often act as the more speculative segment of the market, have been increasingly leaning short during the recent pullback.
That said, this indicator is highly volatile, frequently oscillating between extremes of buy and sell pressure within short periods. While the current bias underscores mounting headwinds, it should be monitored closely to confirm whether this negative tilt matures into a sustained trend or proves to be another transient swing in perpetual positioning.
Live Chart
Fragile Neutrality
To confirm the broader sentiment in perpetual markets, we can pair CVD analysis with funding rates, which track the cost of holding long versus short positions. The 7-day moving average of funding rates across major exchanges currently sits near 0.01%, punctuated by brief spikes to higher values on certain venues.
This pattern suggests that while some leveraged traders have attempted to buy the dip, their efforts have not been strong enough to shift the overall balance. Instead, the market remains in a neutral but fragile state, where a modest uptick in sell pressure could quickly tilt sentiment bearish.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs retracement to $111k leaves the market testing a pivotal range. The $107k‚Äì$108.9k cost basis of recent investors marks critical support, with failure to hold opening the path toward $93k‚Äì$95k, where dense supply clusters could form a mid-term floor. A bounce back toward $113.6k is possible, but would likely meet resistance as stressed short-term holders sell into strength.
At the same time, unrealized and realized losses remain shallow, and SOPR has not signalled broad capitulation. Off-chain, spot demand has neutralized, while perpetual futures lean bearish and fragile. In sum, the correction is modest compared to past cycles, but conviction has weakened, leaving the market balanced between resilience and further downside."

Bitcoin trades near $112k, consolidating between $104k and $116k. URPD shows investors accumulated in the $108k‚Äì$116k range, filling the air gap. This reflects constructive dip-buying, though it does not rule out further contraction.
The break below the 0.95-quantile cost basis ended a 3.5-month euphoric phase, placing the price back into the $104k‚Äì$114k band. Historically, this zone has been a corridor of sideways consolidation before the next decisive trend.
Short-term holder profitability dropped sharply to 42% during the selloff, before rebounding to 60%. This bounce leaves the market neutral but fragile, with confirmation of renewed momentum only if price reclaims $114k‚Äì$116k.
Off-chain sentiment is cooling. Futures funding remains neutral but vulnerable, while ETF inflows have slowed sharply. Bitcoin ETF flows were primarily directional spot demand, while Ethereum flows reflected a mix of spot demand and cash-and-carry arbitrage.

Accumulating in the Gap
Since the mid-August all-time high, Bitcoin has entered a volatile downtrend, declining to $108k before bouncing back toward $112k. With volatility rising, the central question is whether this marks the start of a true bear market or simply a short-term contraction. To address this, we turn to both on-chain and off-chain metrics.
A useful starting point is the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows at what prices the current set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created, providing insight into where investors acquired their coins.
Comparing the snapshot from August 13th with the current structure, it is evident that investors have taken advantage of the pullback into the $108k‚Äì$116k ‚Äúair gap.‚Äù Accumulation has steadily filled this range, reflecting a clear ‚Äúbuy-the-dip‚Äù response. This behaviour is constructive for the longer term, yet it does not eliminate the risk of further contraction in the short to mid-term.
Live Chart
Live Chart
From Euphoria to Exhaustion
While the URPD highlights constructive dip-buying, the case for continued weakness stems from the broader cycle context. The rally to new highs in mid-August was the third multi-month euphoric phase of this cycle, defined by overwhelming price momentum pushing the majority of supply into profit. Sustaining such periods requires relentless capital inflows strong enough to offset persistent profit-taking, a dynamic that rarely endures for long.
This behaviour is captured by the 0.95 quantile cost basis, the threshold above which 95% of supply is in profit. The most recent euphoric phase lasted roughly 3.5 months before demand finally showed signs of exhaustion, with Bitcoin falling back below this band on August 19.
At present, the price trades between the 0.85 and 0.95 quantile cost basis, or in the $104.1k‚Äì$114.3k range. Historically, this zone has acted as a consolidation corridor following euphoric peaks, often leading to a choppy sideways market. Therefore, breaking below $104.1k would replay the post-ATH exhaustion phases seen earlier in this cycle, whereas a recovery above $114.3k would signal demand finding its footing and reclaiming control of the trend.
Live Chart
Short-Term Holders Under Pressure
Given that Bitcoin is now trading in a decisive range, the behaviour of recent buyers becomes crucial. Short-term holders‚Äô unrealized profit and loss are often the main psychological drivers shaping local tops and bottoms, as sudden swings between profit and loss dictate their reactions.
The percentage of short-term holder supply in profit provides a clear lens on this dynamic. With the leg down to $108k, their share in profit collapsed from above 90% to just 42%, a textbook cooling-off from an overheated state to a zone of sudden stress. Such sharp reversals typically provoke fear-driven selling from top buyers, which is then often followed by exhaustion of the very same sellers. This pattern explains the recent rebound from $108k back to $112k.
At current prices, more than 60% of short-term holder supply is back in profit, a neutral stance compared to the extremes of recent weeks. However, this comeback remains fragile. Only a sustained recovery above $114k‚Äì$116k, where over 75% of short-term holder supply would return to profit, could provide the confidence necessary to attract new demand and fuel the next leg higher.
Live Chart
After digesting the current stage of the market through on-chain price models and the profitability lens of short-term holders, the next step is to assess whether off-chain indicators align with these signals or point to divergences
A Sentiment Probe
Among off-chain indicators, the futures market ‚Äî particularly perpetual contracts ‚Äî tends to react most sensitively to shifts in overall sentiment. Funding rates, which reflect the hourly interest longs are willing to pay to hold positions, serve as a direct gauge of speculative demand. Elevated values signal an overheated market, while a drift toward zero or negative values highlights weakening momentum.
With $300k per hour as an established baseline between bullish and bearish phases of the current cycle, and current funding sitting around $366k per hour, the market in a neutral zone: neither overheated like the >$1M per hour peaks of March and December 2024, nor cooled as in the <$300k per hour lows of Q1‚ÄìQ3 2025. Should funding compress further below this threshold, it would confirm that demand is diminishing more broadly across the futures landscape.
Live Chart
TradFi Demand Cooling
Beyond futures markets, another important lens on off-chain sentiment comes from spot ETF flows, which capture the strength of institutional demand from traditional finance. The 14-day average of net inflows highlights how a surge of 56k‚Äì85k ETH per day from May to August 2025 played a pivotal role in driving Ethereum to new highs. Over the past week, however, this pace has slowed sharply to just 16.6k ETH per day, underscoring weakening demand as prices retreated from their peaks.
Bitcoin experienced a similar trend. Inflows that had consistently exceeded 3k BTC per day since April cooled through July, with the current 14-day average now down to only 540 BTC. Taken together, both markets reflect a clear contraction in TradFi buying power, coinciding with the broader pullback in prices over recent weeks.
Live Chart
Live Chart
A Structural Difference
While both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw price appreciation alongside surging ETF inflows, the underlying structure of TradFi demand differed between the two. Comparing cumulative ETF flows with bi-weekly changes in CME open interest reveals these distinctions.
For Bitcoin, ETF inflows have far outweighed changes in futures positioning, indicating that TradFi investors primarily expressed directional demand through spot exposure. In contrast, Ethereum shows a more nuanced picture: bi-weekly changes in CME open interest have amounted to more than 50% of cumulative ETF inflows. This suggests that a large portion of TradFi activity in Ethereum combined spot exposure with cash-and-carry strategies, blending directional bets with neutral arbitrage.
Live Chart
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin sits near $112k, consolidating within the $104k‚Äì$116k range. On-chain signals show short-term holders remain fragile, with profitability recovering from recent lows but not yet strong enough to confirm renewed momentum. Reclaiming $114k‚Äì$116k would restore broad STH profitability and strengthen the bull case. Conversely, a breakdown below $104k risks repeating prior post-ATH exhaustion phases, with downside toward $93k‚Äì$95k.
Off-chain indicators echo this uncertainty. Futures funding is neutral but at risk of softening if demand fades, while ETF inflows that fueled earlier rallies have slowed sharply. For Bitcoin, the recent capital inflow to ETFs was majorly directional demand, while in Ethereum, it was a larger mix of cash-and-carry trades alongside spot exposure."

Bitcoin remains in the $110k‚Äì$116k ‚Äúair gap‚Äù after contracting from its August all-time high. The bounce from $107k was supported by dip-buying, but selling pressure from short-term holders has capped the momentum so far.
Profit-taking by 3‚Äì6 month holders and loss realization by recent top-buyers created headwinds. Sustaining a rally requires the price to stabilize above $114k to rebuild confidence and attract inflows.
On-chain liquidity is still constructive but trending lower. Meanwhile, ETF flows have slowed to ~¬±500 BTC/day, weakening the TradFi demand that previously fuelled upside in March and December 2024.
With spot demand softened, derivatives have become the main driver. Futures basis and volume remain balanced, and options open interest is rising, pointing to a more risk-managed market structure.
The market sits at a crossroads, reclaiming $114k could spark fresh momentum, while a breakdown below $108k risks exposing the next cluster‚Äôs lower band near $93k.

Ranging in Gap
After the mid-August all-time high, market momentum has steadily faded, pulling Bitcoin below the cost basis of recent top-buyers and back into the $110k‚Äì$116k ‚Äúair gap.‚Äù Since then, the price has fluctuated within this range, gradually filling it as supply redistributes. The key question now is whether this represents healthy consolidation or the first leg of a deeper contraction.
As shown in the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD), which maps where supply was last acquired across price levels, the bounce from $108k was underpinned by clear buy pressure on-chain ‚Äî a ‚Äúbuy-the-dip‚Äù structure that helped stabilize the market.
This report examines the sell-side dynamics and momentum across both on-chain and off-chain indicators, highlighting the forces most likely to drive Bitcoin‚Äôs next decisive move out of this range.
Live Chart
Mapping Supply Clusters
To begin, we first map out the cost basis of the clusters around the current price, as these levels often anchor short-term price action.
Based on the CBD heatmap, three distinct cohorts of investors are currently shaping price action:
Top-buyers over the past three months, with a cost basis near $113.8k.
Dip-buyers in the last month clustered around $112.8k.
Short-term holders from the past six months, anchored near $108.3k.
These levels define the current trading range. Reclaiming $113.8k would return top-buyers to profit and fuel a bullish continuation. A breakdown below $108.3k, however, risks tipping short-term holders back into loss, potentially triggering renewed sell pressure and opening a path toward the next major supply cluster‚Äôs low band at $93k.
Live Chart
Profit-Taking by Seasoned Short-Term Holders
Having identified the immediate supply clusters around the current price shaping the range, we next consider how different holder cohorts behaved during the rebound from $108k to $114k.
While dip-buyers provided support, selling pressure came primarily from seasoned short-term holders. The 3‚Äì6 month cohort realized around $189M per day (14-day SMA), accounting for roughly 79% of all short-term holder profits. This suggests that investors who bought earlier over the February-May dip used the recent bounce to exit profitably, creating notable headwinds.
Live Chart
Top-Buyers Realizing Losses
In addition to profit-taking by seasoned short-term investors, recent top-buyers also weighed on the market by realizing losses during the same rebound.
The up-to-3-month cohort realized losses of up to $152M per day (14-day SMA). This behaviour mirrors earlier stress periods in April 2024 and January 2025, when peak-buyers capitulated in a similar fashion.
For a mid-term rally to resume, demand must be strong enough to absorb these losses. Confirmation would come if the price stabilizes above $114k, restoring confidence and encouraging new inflows.
Live Chart
Liquidity Absorbing the Sell-Side
With both profit-taking and loss realization pressuring the market, the next step is to assess whether new liquidity is strong enough to absorb these sellers.
Net Realized Profit, expressed as a share of market cap, provides this measure. The 90-day SMA peaked at 0.065% during the August rally and has since trended lower. While weaker than at the peak, the current level remains elevated, suggesting inflows still provide support.
As long as price holds above $108k, the liquidity backdrop remains constructive. A deeper breakdown, however, could drain these inflows and stall further rallies.
Live Chart
TradFi Flows Losing Steam
Beyond on-chain flows, it is also critical to assess external demand via ETFs, which have been a major driver of this cycle.
Since early August, US Spot ETF netflows have dropped sharply, now hovering near ¬±500 BTC per day (14-day SMA). This is far below the inflow intensity that supported earlier rallies in the current cycle, underscoring a loss of momentum from TradFi investors. Given the pivotal role ETFs have played in fueling upside, their slowdown adds fragility to the current structure.
Live Chart
Derivatives in the Spotlight
With on-chain liquidity softening and ETF demand fading, attention now shifts to derivatives markets, which often set the tone when spot flows weaken.
The Volume Delta Bias, measuring the deviation of cumulative volume delta from its 90-day median, recovered during the rebound from $108k, signalling seller exhaustion across venues like Binance and Bybit. This suggests that futures traders helped absorb recent sell pressure.
Going forward, the evolution of derivatives positioning will be critical to navigating the market in this low spot-liquidity environment.
Live Chart
A Balanced Futures Market
Looking deeper into futures, we find a market that appears balanced rather than overheated.
The 3-month annualized futures basis remains below 10% despite higher prices, reflecting steady demand for leverage without the extremes that often precede liquidations. This suggests a healthier structure, more consistent with accumulation than speculation.
Live Chart
Perpetual futures volume also remains muted, aligning with the typical post-euphoric lull. The absence of aggressive leverage spikes points to an advance built on steadier foundations rather than speculative excess.
Live Chart
Options Growing Role in Risk Management
Finally, the options market provides further insight into how participants are managing risk and shaping exposure.
Bitcoin options open interest has reached record highs, reflecting their growing importance. With ETFs offering spot access, many institutions prefer options to manage risk through protective puts, covered calls, or defined-risk structures.
Live Chart
Implied volatility continues to decline, a sign of a more mature and liquid market. Volatility selling, a common TradFi strategy, has introduced steady downward pressure on implied levels, resulting in more stable price action compared with past cycles.
Live Chart
Open-interest composition shows a clear tilt toward calls over puts, particularly during a top-formation regime, highlighting a market that leans bullish while still managing downside risk. Together, these dynamics point to a healthier, more risk-managed market structure that could dampen both upcoming euphoric and bearish moves.
Live Chart
Conclusion
The Bitcoin market is currently defined by a delicate balance between sell-side pressure and weakening inflows. Profit-taking from seasoned short-term holders, combined with loss realization by recent top-buyers, has limited upside momentum and left the $110k‚Äì$116k range as the dominant battleground.
On-chain liquidity remains constructive but is trending lower, while ETF flows ‚Äî once the cornerstone of this cycle‚Äôs upside ‚Äî have lost intensity. As a result, derivatives markets have taken on greater importance, with futures and options activity helping to absorb selling and shape price direction. Encouragingly, both futures basis and options positioning reflect a more balanced structure than in past overheated phases, pointing to a market advancing on firmer footing.
Looking forward, the ability to reclaim and hold above $114k will be critical in restoring confidence and drawing in fresh inflows. Failure to do so risks renewed stress for short-term holders, with $108k and ultimately $93k as key downside levels. In short, Bitcoin sits at a crossroads, with derivatives support holding the structure together while broader demand must strengthen to fuel the next sustained rally."

Bitcoin gained moderate momentum into the September 17 FOMC meeting. Derivative markets have shifted from a risk-off stance toward a more balanced positioning, with downside concerns easing post-FOMC. Spot markets showed mild sell pressure, while perpetuals absorbed liquidity through short squeezes.
Perpetual Open Interest peaked at 395k BTC before pulling back to ~380k BTC as volatility flushed leveraged traders. Liquidation patterns confirmed shorts were squeezed ahead of the FOMC, followed by long liquidations on the post-rate pullback.
Options Open Interest reached a record 500k BTC, with the September 26 expiry set to be the largest in history. Expiry flows around the $110k max pain level may strongly influence spot.
Volatility repricing into the FOMC lifted the 1-month IV‚ÄìRV spread, while dealer positioning implies hedging flows that can sustain rallies and cushion dips.
On-chain, Bitcoin trades above the cost basis of 95% of supply at $115.2k. Holding this level is key to sustaining momentum, while losing it risks a contraction toward $105.5k.

The Bitcoin market has shown moderate momentum since early September, fueled by anticipation of the FOMC rate cut and optimism around its potential impact.
This report examines market dynamics in the days leading up to the meeting and the post-rate structure across perpetual and options markets. Finally, we turn to on-chain indicators to assess the broader macro cycle and evaluate whether the foundation for a sustained trend is forming.
Perpetual Market Analysis
Through September, Bitcoin stabilized near $107.8k, aligning with the short-term holder cost basis. From this level, the market structure shifted from balanced to modestly seller-driven. This bias is captured by the deviation of Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) from its 90-day median baseline.
In the days leading up to the FOMC meeting, CVD across Coinbase, Binance, and all major exchanges showed mild negative deviations, highlighting net sell pressure in the spot market and a cautious tone among participants.
Live Chart
If we extend the same lens to the perpetual market, the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) bias reveals a notable shift from extreme selling to a nearly balanced state. This reflects a significant return of liquidity, as buy-side flows offset persistent sell pressure from late August through the FOMC meeting.
Such stabilization underscores the futures market‚Äôs central role in supporting the rally, with speculators positioning ahead of a rate cut and anticipating a positive policy outcome.
Live Chart
Perpetual Open Interest
Given the outsized role of futures in current market dynamics, perpetual indicators offer a sharper lens on short-term sentiment.
Perpetual Open Interest climbed to a cycle high of ~395k BTC on September 13, reflecting aggressive positioning. However, by Monday, choppy price action drove OI down to 378k BTC ‚Äî a decline of roughly 4.3%.
Since the FOMC meeting, OI has stabilized between 378k‚Äì384k BTC, a pattern consistent with rising intraday volatility and leveraged traders being flushed around key macro events. This highlights the heightened sensitivity of the futures market to policy-driven catalysts.
Live Chart
Shorts Squeezed, Longs Flushed
Inspecting liquidation dominance over the past 30 days shows that the drop in Open Interest between September 13‚Äì17 was largely driven by short liquidations. This translated into a series of short squeezes ahead of the FOMC announcement, fueling momentum on the long side of perpetuals.
However, this regime was abruptly interrupted by the sharp pullback to $115k after the rate cut, which triggered a wave of high-leverage long liquidations and pushed liquidation dominance to 62%.
Live Chart
Using Glassnode‚Äôs newly launched dashboard on
Liquidation Heatmap & Long/Short Bias
, we can highlight both the recent long flushes and short-term max pain levels. The metrics in this dashboard serve as a proxy for liquidation prices, pinpointing levels where traders risk forced liquidations and helping anticipate potential cascades. Built from the 1,000 largest Bitcoin positions on Hyperliquid, these indicators provide a highly relevant proxy for broader market positioning.
Mapping Max Pain Levels
We start with the liquidation wall to gauge the most immediate max-pain levels for both long and short positions. The latest-hour snapshot highlights potential liquidation ‚Äúwalls‚Äù: prices below spot show long liquidations, while prices above spot show short liquidations.
Currently, the long-side max pain sits at $112.7k, while the short-side max pain is at $121.6k with spot trading at $117.2k. This suggests the market is positioned in a fragile balance, where a downside move risks triggering long liquidations, while an upside break could fuel a short squeeze toward recent highs.
Live Chart
Options Market
Shifting focus to the options market, we use positioning and expiries to gauge short-term volatility expectations.
Rising Options OI and Expiry Dynamics
Open interest in BTC options has surged to nearly 500k BTC, its highest level on record, underscoring growing adoption of options for both hedging and speculation. OI consistently declines at month-end, and even more sharply at quarter-end, before rebuilding. This pattern reflects the dominance of monthly expiries, while weeklies are listed only 2‚Äì3 weeks in advance. Quarterly expiries, often called
‚ÄúTriple Witching,‚Äù
combine weekly, monthly, and quarterly maturities, concentrating flows and liquidity.
Although rising OI does not reveal directional bias, it signals a more sophisticated market deploying complex structures to manage risk. Importantly, as OI peaks near expiry, gamma effects can amplify spot volatility as dealers hedge more aggressively, making expiry days increasingly impactful for BTC price action.
Live Chart
A Record-Breaking Setup
Building on rising open interest, the September 26th expiry emerges as a pivotal event for the options market.
This expiry is the largest in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, reflecting nine months of buildup since its listing. Its strike distribution is unusually broad, with open interest concentrated around $95k puts on the downside and $140k calls on the upside. While these levels are likely to expire out of the money, they highlight where traders have speculated or hedged throughout the year.
The max pain point sits near $110k, the level where most options would expire worthless, often acting as a gravitational pull into expiry. Given the sheer size of this contract, hedging flows could exert significant influence on spot price until roll-off at 8:00 am UTC on Friday, September 26th. Once expired, the market may be freed for sharper volatility moves.
Live Chart
FOMC Repricing
Turning to volatility, the normalized 1-month spread shows how options traders positioned around the FOMC meeting.
Implied volatility tracked realized closely for much of September but spiked higher into the event as market makers repriced risk and traders bid for long gamma. The normalized spread now sits at 0.228, still within its normal zone but slightly elevated. This reflects the extra premium gamma sellers demand to absorb risk, offering income opportunities in an otherwise subdued volatility environment.
Live Chart
Dealer Flows in Focus
To complement volatility spreads, the Options Net Premium Strike Heatmap reveals how traders are positioning across strikes.
Recent months show consistent put selling below spot and call buying above, while in recent days upside demand has intensified. This structure leaves dealers short gamma on the upside and long gamma on the downside, forcing them to buy into both rallies and dips as hedges. The resulting flow provides fuel to extend upside moves while simultaneously cushioning declines, reinforcing stability around key strike zones.
Live Chart
Macro Navigation with On-Chain Data
Having reviewed perpetual and options indicators, we now turn to on-chain metrics to assess the market from a macro, investor-behaviour perspective.
Following the FOMC meeting, Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $117.2k pushed the majority of supply back into profit. The Supply Quantiles Cost Basis model shows that price is now above the cost basis of 95% of supply at $115.2k. Sustaining this level is critical for maintaining demand-side momentum. Conversely, failure to hold above it would raise the probability of contracting back into the 85%‚Äì95% quantile range between $105.5k‚Äì$115.2k, where weaker conviction and renewed selling pressure could emerge.
Live Chart
Conclusion
The Bitcoin market remains delicately balanced following the FOMC-driven rally. In futures, net sell pressure in spot was offset by renewed liquidity in perpetuals, where short squeezes and liquidations played a key role.
Options markets highlight record open interest and a historic quarterly expiry, pointing to heightened volatility potential, with dealer flows providing both support on dips and fuel for rallies.
On-chain, Bitcoin trades above the cost basis of 95% of supply, a level that now serves as a critical line in the sand. Holding above $115.2k would sustain demand-driven momentum, while losing it risks a contraction back toward the $105.5k‚Äì$115.2k range. Together, these signals suggest a market awaiting confirmation where stability above key cost-basis levels could extend upside, while fragility in flows keeps downside risk alive."

Bitcoin shows signs of exhaustion after the FOMC rally. Long-term holders have realized 3.4M BTC in profits, while ETF inflows slowed. With spot and futures under stress, the short-term holder cost basis at $111k is the key level to hold or risk deeper cooling.
Executive Summary
Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase after the FOMC-driven rally, showing signs of ‚Äúbuy the rumour, sell the news‚Äù dynamics. The broader market structure points toward fading momentum.
On-chain drawdown remains mild at 8%, but realized cap inflows of $678B and 3.4M BTC in long-term holder profits highlight the unprecedented scale of capital rotation and distribution.
ETF inflows, once a key absorber of supply, slowed sharply around the FOMC as long-term holder distribution accelerated, creating a fragile balance in flows.
Spot volumes spiked during the sell-off, futures markets saw heavy deleveraging, and liquidation clusters revealed vulnerability to liquidity-driven swings on both sides of the market.
Options markets repriced aggressively, with skew surging and puts in high demand, signalling defensive positioning. Combined with peak gamma conditions, the macro backdrop suggests a market increasingly exhausted.

From Rally to Correction
Following the FOMC-driven rally that peaked near $117k, Bitcoin has transitioned into a corrective phase, echoing a textbook ‚Äúbuy the rumour, sell the news‚Äù pattern. In this edition, we step back from short-term swings to assess the broader market structure, using long-term on-chain indicators, ETF demand, and derivatives positioning to evaluate whether this pullback reflects healthy consolidation or the early stages of deeper contraction.
On-Chain Analysis
Volatility in Context
Building on this, the current drawdown from the $124k ATH to $113.7k is just 8%,  mild compared to the cycle‚Äôs 28% drawdown or the 60% declines of prior cycles. This aligns with the long-term trend of diminishing volatility, both across macro cycles and within intra-cycle phases, resembling the steady advance of 2015‚Äì2017, so far without its late-stage blow-off rally.
Live Chart
Cycle Duration
Extending the view, overlaying the last four cycles highlights how peak returns have diminished over time, even as the present trajectory remains closely aligned with the prior two cycles. Assuming $124k marked the global top, this cycle has lasted roughly
1,030 days
, very close to the ~1,060-day lengths of the previous two cycles.
Live Chart
Capital Inflows Measured
Beyond price action, capital deployment provides a more robust lens.
Realized Cap, measuring the cumulative capital invested to absorb older supply at higher values, has risen in three waves since November 2022. Lifting the total to
$1.06T
, reflecting the scale of inflows underpinning this cycle.
Live Chart
Realized Cap Growth
To contextualize:
2011‚Äì2015: $4.2B
2015‚Äì2018: $85B
2018‚Äì2022: $383B
2022‚ÄìPresent: $678B
This cycle has already absorbed
$678B in net inflows
, nearly
1.8x larger
than the prior cycle, underscoring its unprecedented magnitude in capital rotation.
Live Chart
Profit Realization Peaks
Another difference lies in the inflow structure. Unlike the single prolonged waves of earlier cycles, this cycle has seen three distinct multi-month surges. The Realized Profit/Loss Ratio shows that each time profit-taking exceeded 90% of coins moved, marking cyclical peaks. Having just stepped away from the third such extreme,
probabilities favour a cooling phase ahead
.
Live Chart
LTH Profit Dominance
The scale is even clearer when focusing on long-term holders. This measure tracks cumulative LTH profits from a new ATH to the cycle peak. Historically, their heavy distribution marks the tops. In this cycle,
LTHs have realized 3.4M BTC
, already surpassing previous cycles, highlighting both cohort maturity and the magnitude of capital rotation.
Live Chart
Off-Chain Analysis
ETF Demand vs LTHs
This cycle has also been shaped by the tug-of-war between long-term holders distributing supply and institutional demand via US spot ETFs and DATs. With ETFs a new structural force, price now reflects this push-pull: LTH profit-taking caps upside, while ETF inflows absorb distribution and sustain the cycle‚Äôs advance.
Live Chart
Fragile Balance
ETF inflows have so far balanced LTH selling, but with little margin for error. Around the FOMC,
LTH distribution surged to 122k BTC/month, while ETF netflows (7D-SMA) collapsed from 2.6k BTC/day to nearly zero.
The combination of rising sell pressure and fading institutional demand created a fragile backdrop, setting the stage for weakness.
Live Chart
Spot Market Stress
This fragility was visible in spot markets. During the post-FOMC sell-off, volumes spiked as forced liquidations and thin liquidity exaggerated the move lower. Aggressive sell flows overwhelmed order books, accelerating the decline. While painful,
this absorption formed a temporary foundation just above the short-term holder cost basis near $111.8k.
Live Chart
Futures Deleveraging
At the same time,
futures open interest fell sharply from $44.8B to $42.7B as Bitcoin broke below $113k
. This deleveraging event flushed out leveraged longs, amplifying downside pressure. While destabilizing in the moment, the reset helped clear excess leverage and restore balance to derivatives markets.
Live Chart
Liquidation Clusters
Perpetual liquidation heatmaps add colour. As price broke
$114k‚Äì$112k
, dense clusters of leveraged longs were wiped out, driving heavy liquidations and accelerating downside. Risk pockets remain above $117k, leaving both sides of the market vulnerable to liquidity-driven swings. Without stronger demand, fragility around these levels increases the risk of further sharp moves.
Live Chart
Volatility Response
Turning to the options market, implied volatility provides a clear lens on how traders navigated a turbulent week. Two major catalysts shaped the landscape: the first rate cut of the year and the largest liquidation event since 2021. Volatility climbed into the FOMC as hedging demand built, only to fade quickly once the cut was confirmed, signaling the move was largely priced in. However, the sharp Sunday night futures liquidation reignited demand for protection, with one-week IV leading the rebound and strength extending across maturities.
Live Chart
Skew Repricing
After the FOMC, BTC skew briefly approached equilibrium, with downside puts carrying little premium over calls. That calm quickly faded. On Friday, 1W skew spiked from ~1.5% to 17%, a sharp repricing that also lifted longer expiries.
While skew is often more reactive than predictive, in this case it revealed aggressive demand for puts ‚Äî either as protection against a sharp drawdown or as a way to monetize volatility. Just two days later, the market delivered on that signal with the largest liquidation event since 2021.
Live Chart
Put/Call Flows
Following the sell-off, the put/call volume ratio has trended lower as traders locked in profits on in-the-money puts and others rotated into cheaper calls. Skew reinforces this picture: short- and mid-dated options remain heavily tilted toward puts, leaving downside protection expensive relative to upside. For participants with a constructive view into year-end, this imbalance creates opportunities ‚Äî either by accumulating calls at relatively low cost or financing them through selling richly priced downside exposure.
Live Chart
Gamma Overhang
Total options open interest is hovering near all-time highs and will unwind sharply at Friday morning‚Äôs expiry, before rebuilding into December. For now, the market sits in a peak gamma zone, where even small price swings force aggressive dealer hedging. Dealers are positioned short gamma on the downside and long gamma on the upside, a structure that amplifies sell-offs while capping rallies. This dynamic skews near-term volatility risk to the downside, reinforcing fragility until expiry clears and positioning resets.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs retreat following the FOMC reflects a textbook ‚Äúbuy the rumour, sell the news‚Äù pattern, but the broader backdrop points to growing exhaustion. On-chain, the current 8% drawdown is modest compared to past cycles, yet comes after three major waves of capital inflows that lifted realized cap by $678B, almost double the prior cycle. Long-term holders have already realized 3.4M BTC in profits, underscoring the heavy distribution and maturity of the rally.
At the same time, ETF inflows that previously absorbed supply have slowed, creating a fragile balance. Spot volumes spiked on forced selling, futures saw sharp deleveraging, and options markets priced in downside risk as skew surged. Together, these signals suggest a market running out of fuel, with liquidity-driven swings dominating.
Unless demand from institutions and holders aligns again, the risk of deeper cooling remains high, highlighting a macro structure that increasingly resembles exhaustion."

Bitcoin continues to defend key on-chain support at the short-term holder cost basis, while ETFs and cooling LTH supply offer stability. Options markets reset post-expiry, with OI rebuilding, volatility easing, and flows tilting toward cautious Q4 upside.
Executive Summary
Bitcoin repeatedly defended the short-term holder cost basis, underscoring its role as a key pivot between bullish continuation and bearish risk. Price faces strong resistance at the $118k supply cluster, where recent top buyers may look to exit.
Long-term holder distribution has cooled after months of steady selling, and ETF inflows have resumed, providing a stabilizing influence on market structure. Together, these dynamics point to healthier demand-side conditions.
The Fear & Greed Index has retreated from sustained Greed into Neutral and Fear territory, reflecting profit-taking and reduced risk appetite. RVT trends confirm this cooling backdrop, with fewer profits realized relative to network value.
Options open interest reset after last week‚Äôs record expiry, now rebuilding into Q4. This reset clears hedging-driven noise and leaves room for new positioning to guide price action.
Volatility signals are easing, with front-end IV declining and skew moving closer to neutral. The term structure remains in contango, with back-end IV holding firm in the 39‚Äì43% range.
Flows show cautious upside interest, with traders adding risk reversals and cheap convexity while selling puts. This positioning reflects measured optimism aligned with seasonal ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù dynamics.
Dealer gamma exposure is balanced across both sides, muting hedging flows and helping dampen intraday volatility. With no large expiries ahead, the near-term backdrop remains stable and neutral.

Holding the Line
Bitcoin‚Äôs FOMC rally quickly reversed as profit-taking pushed prices down to $109k, slipping below the short-term holder cost basis at $111.6k. The decline was met with strong buy-side demand, driving a rebound toward $118.8k. This report explores key on-chain and options indicators to assess market dynamics and gauge prevailing expectations among speculative participants.
On-Chain Outlook
Holding the Line
Building on this rebound, the short-term holder cost basis has once again emerged as a critical pivot.
Since May 2025, this level has acted as support on five separate occasions
, underscoring its role as a defining boundary between bullish and bearish regimes.
Each successful defense reinforces investor conviction and highlights the sensitivity of short-term capital to this threshold. Sustaining above this cost basis improves the odds of further upside, while it does not guarantee continuation.
Live Chart
Supply Overhang
However, sustaining momentum requires clearing a significant hurdle. The recent bounce now faces a dense supply cluster accumulated between late August and the $114k‚Äì$118k range. Holders who bought near these highs may view the rebound as an opportunity to exit at break-even or modest profit, creating notable overhead resistance.
Overcoming this wave of sell pressure is crucial before the market can attempt another push toward new all-time highs.
A decisive stabilization above $118k would signal that demand is absorbing the top-buyers‚Äô supply, strengthening the case for further upside.
Live Chart
Cooling Payload
Despite price repeatedly finding support around the short-term holder cost basis, a longer-term trend is emerging beneath the surface. The
Short-Term Holder Realized Value (RVT)
ratio, which measures the economic value realized relative to the nominal value transferred, has steadily declined since May.
Elevated RVT values often indicate overheated markets, while contractions toward the ‚ÄúFull Market Detox‚Äù zone point to fading speculative excess.
At present, RVT is well below peak extremes, suggesting short-term holders are realizing fewer profits relative to overall network activity. Should RVT compress further and combine with capitulation signals, it could usher in an accumulation phase as investors wait for clearer market direction.
Live Chart
Fear or Disbelief?
As the broader backdrop of cooling speculative activity unfolds, sentiment has followed suit. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has shifted sharply lower, sliding from sustained Greed earlier this year into Fear and Neutral territory. This shift signals profit-taking, reduced risk appetite, and a more cautious stance among participants.
While sentiment resets can weigh on momentum in the short term, they also tend to clear excessive optimism and create conditions for healthier bases of support. Current readings point to a consolidation phase, with the market waiting for renewed conviction before committing to a decisive directional move.
Live Chart
LTH Supply Shift
Alongside the overhead pressure from top buyers, the balance between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and ETFs has shaped recent price action. Over the past several weeks, LTHs have acted as a core source of supply, locking in profits during rallies. However, the
Long-Term Holders Net Position Change (3D)
has now shifted toward neutral, signaling a slowdown in distribution after months of consistent selling. This cooling supply pressure suggests that the recent phase of long-term holder profit-taking may be easing, potentially leaving ETFs and new inflows as more decisive drivers of market direction.
Live Chart
ETF Flows Steadying
Complementing the slowdown in long-term holder distribution, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs remain a central force in market structure. Flows have been volatile in recent months, with mid-September‚Äôs strong inflows followed by a string of outflow sessions.
The most recent data, however, point to a return of net inflows, underscoring that institutional appetite remains intact despite ongoing profit rotation. Should this renewed demand align with reduced LTH selling, ETFs could provide a stabilizing force, offering a more constructive foundation for price resilience and supporting the conditions needed for a sustainable advance.
Live Chart
Options Market Outlook
Next, our focus shifts from on-chain signals to the options market for deeper context. Following last week‚Äôs record expiry, open interest has sharply reset and is now rebuilding into Q4. In this report, we examine positioning, volatility, and flows to evaluate how options traders are shaping expectations for Bitcoin‚Äôs next phase.
Post-Expiry Reset
As of 08:00 UTC, Wednesday 1 October, Bitcoin has digested its largest options expiry on record, triggering a sharp reduction in open interest across expiries and strikes. This mechanical reset removes hedging-driven noise and leaves the market clearer for new positioning into Q4. Historically, major expiries often underpin price action, with the subsequent rebuild in OI reflecting more deliberate views on direction and volatility.
The current phase, therefore, marks a cleaner ground for assessing how traders are positioning into the next leg of the cycle.
Live Chart
Volatility Landscape
Following the reset in open interest, attention shifts to the volatility surface, where short-dated premiums have eased. One-week at-the-money implied volatility fell by nearly 5%points from last week‚Äôs highs, while the two-week tenor declined by about 2%. In contrast, longer-dated maturities held steady or edged slightly higher, leaving the curve steeper overall.
This structure reflects a market where near-term stress has faded, yet caution persists further out the curve.
Despite the front-end retreat, implied volatility remains elevated relative to realized, keeping carry trades positive, though less compelling than a week earlier. The term structure remains in contango, with short-dated contracts anchored around 30% IV, while three-month and longer maturities hold between 39% and 43%.
The steepening highlights a shift from short-term risk hedging to more measured, longer-dated caution.
Live Chart
Skew Nears Neutral
Building on the softer front-end volatility, option skew has also moderated. The 25-Delta Risk Reversal in
one-week contracts fell sharply from roughly 18.5 vol points to around 6 vol points, marking a significant move away from downside protection toward balance
. Longer maturities have also flattened, drifting closer to neutral territory. This adjustment reflects cooling demand for puts as immediate downside stress eases, while call premiums begin to catch up. Together, the shift signals a more balanced risk outlook, where traders are less focused on hedging tail risk and more willing to express directional upside.
Live Chart
Flows: Upside Interest Returns
With skew moving toward neutral, positioning has shifted toward the call side. Traders have been lifting upside calls in line with the typical Q4 seasonal bias, with net call premium concentrated in the $136k‚Äì$145k range. Higher strikes, however, saw call selling, suggesting the market is not chasing extreme upside but instead using structure to capture cheap convexity.
Flows also show a preference for strategies that monetize skew while retaining optionality into year-end catalysts. Put selling has picked up as well, consistent with the skew compression noted earlier. Overall, traders appear to have used last week‚Äôs pullback to add risk reversals‚Äîselling puts and buying calls‚Äîpositioning for Q4 optionality and the seasonal ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù narrative.
Live Chart
Dealer Gamma: Neutral Backdrop
Dealer positioning remains quiet following the record expiry. With open interest normalized back to average levels, the calendar shows no major expiries in the near term. Since gamma effects are most pronounced at-the-money and close to maturity, the absence of large clusters reduces the likelihood of significant dealer-driven hedging flows.
Current positioning is broadly long gamma on both downside and upside strikes, which helps dampen intraday volatility and stabilize spot around prevailing levels. However, these exposures are modest and remain far from any meaningful expiry points, l
eaving the options market in a neutral state until new positioning builds closer to upcoming dates.
Conclusion
On-chain dynamics continue to highlight the pivotal role of the short-term holder cost basis, which has served as reliable support since May 2025. Price remains challenged by the dense supply cluster between $114k and $118k, yet the easing in long-term holder distribution and the return of ETF inflows suggest stabilizing demand. Sentiment, as measured by RVT and the Fear & Greed Index, points to a cooling phase, with conditions shifting toward consolidation rather than capitulation.
In the options market, the record expiry has reset positioning, with open interest now rebuilding into Q4. Volatility has softened, skew is drifting toward neutral, and the curve remains in contango with a firmer back end. Flows show measured upside interest, while dealer gamma remains broadly balanced, muting hedging flows. Together, these signals suggest a market resetting into a more neutral, constructive backdrop, awaiting conviction for the next decisive move."
2025,40,2025-W40,2025-09-29,2025-10-05,Bullish,114365.07,123520.79,119430.26,8.01,Agree,"Excerpt
Bitcoin broke through the $114k‚Äì$117k supply zone to reach a new all-time high near $126k, backed by strong ETF inflows and renewed mid-tier accumulation. While on-chain and spot signals remain constructive, rising leverage and crowded call positioning suggest growing short-term fragility.
Executive Summary
On-chain profitability has surged, with 97% of supply now in profit. While elevated profit levels often precede consolidation, realized profits remain contained, suggesting an orderly rotation rather than distribution pressure.
The $117K supply cluster has been flipped into support, marking a structural pivot where small and mid-sized holders continue to accumulate, offsetting moderate profit-taking from larger entities.
Bitcoin has broken to new all-time highs near $126K, driven by renewed spot demand and record ETF inflows exceeding $2.2B. The surge in institutional participation has lifted both price and market activity, with spot volumes reaching multi-month highs as Q4 begins.
Derivatives markets expanded sharply during the rally, with futures open interest and funding rates rising as late longs entered. The current pullback is now testing this leverage, helping to reset positioning and restore balance.
In the options market, implied volatility has lifted, skew turned neutral, and call-heavy flows dominate. Momentum remains strong, but bullish positioning is becoming increasingly crowded.

Bitcoin has broken through the dense supply cluster held by top buyers between $114k and $117k, establishing a new all-time high at $126k. This breakout signals renewed market strength but also raises questions about sustainability at elevated levels. In this edition, we analyze on-chain accumulation and distribution patterns alongside spot and options market dynamics to assess short-term risk, market resilience, and the potential for continuation or near-term fragility.
On-Chain Outlook
Accumulation Resurgence
Following Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout to new highs, we turn to the
Trend Accumulation Score
to evaluate underlying demand strength. This metric measures the balance between accumulation and distribution across wallet cohorts.
Recent readings indicate a clear resurgence in buying, driven by small to mid-sized entities (10‚Äì1k BTC), which have accumulated consistently over the past few weeks. Meanwhile, whale distribution has eased from earlier in the year.
The alignment among mid-tier holders points to a more organic accumulation phase, adding structural depth and resilience to the ongoing rally.
Resistance Flipped into Support
Building on the accumulation trend, Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to a new all-time high has lifted nearly all circulating supply back into profit.
The Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shows limited structural support between $121k and $120k, with a stronger cluster near $117k, where roughly 190k BTC were last acquired.
While price discovery phases inherently carry the risk of exhaustion, a potential pullback into this region could invite renewed demand as recent buyers defend profitable entry zones, marking a key area to watch for stabilization and a resurgence of momentum.
Live Chart
Mild Profit-Taking
As Bitcoin enters a price discovery phase, assessing the degree of profit realization helps gauge whether the rally remains sustainable. The
Sell-Side Risk Ratio
, which measures the value of realized profits and losses relative to total realized value, serves as a proxy for investors‚Äô willingness to spend their coins.
Recently, this ratio has rebounded from its lower bound, signalling a rise in profit-taking after a quiet period.
Although still well below historical extremes tied to cycle tops, this uptick indicates that investors are locking in gains in a measured fashion.
Overall, selling remains controlled and consistent with a healthy bullish phase, though continued monitoring is warranted as prices advance.

Spot and Futures Analysis
ETF Flows Drive Bitcoin to New Highs
Shifting focus from on-chain dynamics to market demand, Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout to new all-time highs near $126k has been underpinned by a sharp resurgence in
U.S. spot ETF Inflows
.
Following September‚Äôs redemptions, more than $2.2B has poured back into ETFs within a single week, marking one of the strongest buying waves since April.
This renewed institutional participation has absorbed available spot supply and strengthened overall market liquidity. Seasonally, Q4 has historically been Bitcoin‚Äôs strongest quarter, often coinciding with renewed risk appetite and portfolio rebalancing.
As broader markets tilt toward higher-beta assets such as crypto and small caps, sustained ETF inflows through October and November could provide a durable tailwind, anchoring confidence and supporting prices into year-end.
Live Chart
Spot Volume is Back
With ETF inflows reigniting demand, trading activity in the spot market has surged in tandem. Daily
Spot Volume
has climbed to its highest levels since April, confirming renewed market participation and deeper liquidity.
This uptick reflects growing confidence behind Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout to new highs
. Sustained volume will be essential for validating the rally‚Äôs strength, as fading turnover after major advances has historically preceded short-term exhaustion and corrective phases.
Live Chart
Leverage Build Up
Following the surge in spot activity, the futures market has also heated up.
Future Open Interest
has risen sharply, setting new highs as Bitcoin broke above $120k. This expansion indicates a wave of leveraged long positions entering the market, a setup that often fuels short-term volatility.
Periods of rapid OI growth typically resolve through liquidations or brief cooling phases, allowing excess leverage to unwind and positioning to reset before the next sustainable trend can form.
Live Chart
Funding Rates Heat Up
As futures open interest expands,
Funding Rates
have climbed in parallel with Bitcoin‚Äôs advance to new highs. Annualized funding now exceeds 8%, signalling elevated demand for leveraged long exposure and a rise in speculative activity.
Although not yet at overheated levels, sharp increases in funding often precede short-term cooling as leverage is flushed out.
Historically, such phases result in brief pullbacks or profit-taking before the market can re-establish a more balanced structure.
Live Chart
Options Market Outlook
Uptober Bid Lifts the Curve
Turning to the options market, implied volatility has firmed as traders reposition into Q4. The entire
Implied Volatility Term Structure
has shifted higher over the past two weeks, reflecting growing optimism and renewed demand for optionality.
The October 31 expiry ‚Äî a key date aligned with the ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù narrative ‚Äî has risen from 34 to 36 vols, while the back end has gained about one vol point. This upward shift signals not only short-term bullish sentiment but also confidence extending into 2026, suggesting longer-dated options are attracting renewed interest.
Live Chart
Short-Term Vol Squeeze
Alongside the broader lift in the term structure,
At-The-Money Implied Volatility
has risen across all maturities by about one volatility point. The exception is the one-week tenor, which spiked from
31.75% to 36.01%
, marking a notable short-term surge.
This sharp move reflects traders adding gamma exposure while short-vol sellers were forced to cover and roll positions to higher strikes and longer expiries.
The result was a classic volatility squeeze concentrated in near-term contracts, highlighting renewed sensitivity to short-dated price movements and elevated demand for tactical hedging.
Live Chart
A Sharp Sentiment Reversal
The past two weeks have brought a pronounced shift in options sentiment, as evident in the rapid adjustment in skew. What began as a deeply bearish structure turned nearly neutral by Monday, before renewed hedge demand modestly tilted the balance back toward puts.
The near-term
25-Delta Skew
narrowed from roughly 18 vol points put-rich to just 3 vol points by Friday, a remarkable 21-point swing in under a week. As noted previously, such extreme skews often precede reversals, and this time was no exception.
Traders responded by bidding calls relative to puts, seeking upside exposure as Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout gained momentum, marking a clear rotation from defensive hedging to opportunistic positioning.
Live Chart
Flows Set the Stage for Volatility
Recent options flow data reveal an active tug-of-war near current price levels. Call activity dominates, yet both buyers and sellers are engaging at scale, reflecting a mix of strategies. Some participants are pursuing upside convexity through call spreads and ratios to manage costs, while others are writing covered calls to monetize volatility and cap gains on spot exposure.
Dealers remain largely long gamma around these strikes, particularly into the month-end expiry, positioning for elevated volatility. This structure suggests potential two-way pressure: long gamma traders may fade rallies to secure profits, while short gamma players could be forced to chase and hedge as prices extend.
The result is a setup ripe for amplified swings as the market navigates uncharted territory
Live Chart
All in all, the options landscape reflects a more balanced yet increasingly active market. With skew now near neutral and implied volatility elevated, positioning for upside is no longer as inexpensive as it was a week ago. Many traders have already secured bullish exposure, driving call premiums higher and compressing risk-reward on fresh long-vol trades.
While momentum remains strong and sentiment remains constructive, positioning has become more crowded, suggesting that near-term volatility could remain elevated as markets digest this renewed optimism.
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout above the $114k‚Äì$117k supply cluster and new all-time high near $126k highlights renewed market strength supported by mid-tier accumulation and easing whale distribution. On-chain data point to key support between $117k and $120k, where nearly 190k BTC last changed hands, a zone likely to attract dip buyers if momentum cools.
In the spot and futures markets, ETF inflows exceeding $2.2B and surging volumes confirm strong institutional demand, although rising leverage and funding rates above 8% introduce short-term fragility.
Meanwhile, options markets show higher implied volatility, neutral skew, and call-heavy positioning, signalling constructive sentiment but a more crowded landscape.
Together, these signals outline a robust yet maturing uptrend, one that remains supported but increasingly sensitive to profit-taking and leverage resets as Bitcoin navigates price discovery."

Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to a new all-time high at $126.1k reversed amid macro tensions and a $19B futures deleveraging, one of the largest in history. The drop below the $117k‚Äì$114k cost-basis zone placed top buyers in loss and exposed renewed market fragility.
On-chain data show continued Long-Term Holder distribution since July and weaker ETF inflows (-2.3k BTC this week), indicating fading institutional demand. Meanwhile, spot markets experienced a sharp but orderly sell-off, with Binance-driven selling partially offset by buying on Coinbase.
Futures markets underwent a historic leverage flush, with the Estimated Leverage Ratio collapsing to multi-month lows and funding rates plunging to 2022 FTX levels, signalling peak fear and forced liquidations.
In the options market, open interest and volume rebounded quickly, but volatility spiked to 76%, and short-dated skew flipped to +17% put-rich before stabilizing. The market remains in a reset phase, awaiting renewed demand to confirm recovery.

On-Chain Insights
Bitcoin‚Äôs rally above the $114k‚Äì$117k supply cluster culminated in a new all-time high at $126.1k before losing momentum. The renewed sell pressure, amplified by concerns over escalating U.S.‚ÄìChina tariff tensions, triggered a sharp market-wide deleveraging, with futures open interest contracting by more than $19B.
In this edition, we examine the aftermath of this correction through both on-chain and off-chain lenses to assess the current state of market sentiment and structural resilience.
From Euphoria to Fragility
This latest contraction is particularly concerning, as it marks the third instance since late August where Bitcoin‚Äôs spot price has dipped below the 0.95-quantile price model ($117.1k)‚Äîa level where over 5% of supply, primarily held by top buyers, sits at a loss. Price now resides within the 0.85‚Äì0.95 quantile range ($108.4k‚Äì$117.1k), retracing from the euphoric phase of the recent rally.
Without a renewed catalyst to lift prices back above $117.1k, the market risks deeper contraction toward the lower boundary of this range.
Historically, when price fails to hold this zone, it has often preceded prolonged mid- to long-term corrections, making a sustained drop below $108k a critical warning signal of structural weakness.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holders Continue to Distribute
Adding to the market‚Äôs inability to sustain its euphoric phase, the persistent Long-Term Holder (LTH) distribution since July 2025 has further constrained upside momentum.
During this period, the LTH supply has declined by roughly 0.3M BTC, highlighting steady profit realization among mature investors.
This ongoing sell-side pressure underscores the risk of demand exhaustion, with the market likely to enter a consolidation phase. Should distribution persist without a corresponding inflow of new demand, periodic corrections or localized capitulation events may emerge before equilibrium is restored.
Live Chart
Off-Chain Insights
ETF Flows Lose Momentum
Following the largest liquidation event in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, U.S. spot ETF flows have weakened in tandem with price. While the derivatives market underwent extreme deleveraging, ETF investors also showed mild selling pressure, with cumulative netflow turning negative by 2.3k BTC so far this week. This behavior contrasts with prior capitulation phases, where outflows typically accelerated alongside price declines.
The current moderation suggests hesitation rather than panic. However, sustained weakness or a prolonged delay in ETF inflows returning to strength would signal demand-side fragility, undermining one of the key drivers behind Bitcoin‚Äôs prior rallies.
Live Chart
Spot Selling Pressure
During the recent liquidation cascade, spot trading volumes surged sharply, marking one of the highest levels recorded this year. The spike reflects intense market activity as traders rushed to adjust positions amid heightened volatility.
Live Chart
Pairing this spike in spot volume with the
Cumulative Volume Delta Bias (CVDB)
‚Äî which measures deviations from the 90-day median of cumulative trade flow ‚Äî reveals a notable divergence across major exchanges. Binance faced heavy taker sell pressure, while Coinbase saw net buying activity, suggesting institutional participants were absorbing supply on U.S. venues.
The aggregated CVDB shows only a mild net sell bias, far less severe than the sharp spot capitulation observed in late February 2025.
This indicates that, despite elevated volatility, the recent drawdown reflected localized deleveraging rather than a broad investor exit.
Live Chart
A Futures Market Breakdown
The recent collapse in Bitcoin futures open interest ranks among the largest single-day contractions on record, erasing more than $10 billion in notional positions. This marks a major derivatives market flush-out, comparable in magnitude to the May 2021 liquidation and the 2022 FTX unwind.
The steep decline reflects widespread forced deleveraging, as margin calls triggered liquidations across both long and short positions.
Notably, with Bitcoin‚Äôs price still holding above key on-chain support, the event appears to be driven primarily by leverage compression rather than broad spot selling ‚Äî a structural reset rather than a full capitulation.
Live Chart
Historic Leverage Flush
Following the sharp contraction in futures open interest, the
Estimated Leverage Ratio,
open interest relative to exchange balances, also collapsed to multi-month lows. This historic deleveraging event cleared excessive leverage across the system, marking one of the largest single-session resets on record.
The magnitude of the drop suggests widespread unwinding of positions, also extending to altcoin markets.
While painful, such flush-outs help reduce systemic risk and lay the groundwork for a more stable market structure ahead.
Live Chart
Funding Rates Plunge to 2022 FTX Levels
Following the historic leverage flush, the futures market stress deepened as funding rates collapsed to levels not seen since the FTX fallout in late 2022.
Across perpetual futures, annualized funding briefly turned sharply negative, showing traders paying a premium to stay short after bullish leverage was wiped out.
This marks a complete sentiment reversal, with participants rapidly de-risking amid forced liquidations.
Historically, such extreme funding resets have coincided with peak fear and the final stages of deleveraging, often cleansing excess leverage and restoring balance for a healthier recovery phase in the mid-term.
Live Dashboard
Options Market
Options OI Rebuilt Fast and Close to ATH
With futures markets undergoing a deep deleveraging, attention now turns to the options market, where activity has recovered remarkably quickly.
It took little time for Bitcoin options open interest to rebuild following the major expiry on September 26. OI has already climbed back near its all-time highs, underscoring how rapidly traders reloaded exposure once positions were cleared. Recent volatility and liquidations likely accelerated this recovery, as participants sought to hedge against risk and manage downside exposure.
The swift rebound highlights robust engagement and continued reliance on options for both protection and tactical positioning in a volatile environment.
Live Chart
Options Volume Surged as BTC Volatility Spiked
Following the rapid increase in open interest, the options market experienced a surge in trading activity as volatility spiked. Following Bitcoin‚Äôs sharp drop late Friday, volumes rose dramatically into Saturday as traders scrambled to adjust risk. The data show clear bursts of activity during and immediately after the selloff.
This reaction was driven by gamma dynamics; short gamma traders were forced to buy back exposure to manage margin and avoid liquidations, while long gamma participants supplied liquidity at elevated premiums.
The spike in volume reflected a market in stress-management mode, with hedges recalibrated, liquidity tightening, and demand for short-term protection surging.
The next step is to assess how implied volatility evolved in response to this dislocation.
Live Chart
Front-End Volatility Blew Out as Liquidations Hit
As the liquidation cascade accelerated around 7 PM UTC last Friday, 1-week implied volatility surged from 35% to a peak of 76%, its highest level since April 2025. At those highly inflated levels, gamma sellers quickly stepped in to sell volatility, capitalizing on the squeeze.
The spike in vol was a textbook volatility squeeze: short-dated short-vol positions were forced to cover and roll further out, driving the front end sharply higher. In practice, that means traders had to buy back their short-dated options at much higher prices while simultaneously selling longer-dated options to re-establish short exposure further out the curve. This flow created a temporary dislocation, with short tenors exploding higher while longer maturities stayed relatively anchored, leaving a steep and distorted curve.
The gap between short- and long-dated vols came from that imbalance: short-term panic and forced buying on the front end, versus longer maturities where traders were already fading the move and selling vol as liquidation pressure began to ease.
Live Chart
Put/Call Volume Ratio Spiked Pre-Crash
Ahead of the market‚Äôs sharp decline, the put/call volume ratio, measuring the relative share of traded puts versus calls, surged dramatically.
On Friday, as Bitcoin hovered near $121.7k, the ratio jumped above 1.0, closing at 1.41 and peaking near 1.51, up from roughly 0.8 earlier in the week.
While not always predictive of downside, such abrupt spikes often signal structural stress or concentrated hedging, suggesting traders were actively positioning for risk even before the broader liquidation cascade began.
Live Chart
Fear Driving Up the Front-End Skew
Following the extreme volatility surge, attention shifts to the options skew, which vividly captured traders‚Äô flight to protection. The 25-delta skew (calculated as
Put - Call
) exploded across expiries after the largest liquidation in BTC options history, as demand for downside hedges soared.
Before the crash, short-dated skew had nearly normalized, with the 1-week tenor around ‚Äì1.3%, implying a slight call premium. As fear took hold, it flipped violently to +17%, marking one of the sharpest short-term repricings of downside optionality this year.
As volatility cooled, short-dated skew retraced while longer maturities stayed anchored; the 3- and 6-month tenors even showed slightly lower put premiums.
This steadiness on the long end suggests traders used the dip to accumulate long-dated calls into 2026, favouring strategic exposure over short-term panic protection.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to a new all-time high at $126.1k quickly reversed as macro stress and extreme leverage triggered one of the largest $19B deleveraging events in derivatives history.
The drop below the $117k‚Äì$114k cost-basis cluster placed top buyers back in loss, reinforcing near-term fragility. On-chain data point to cooling demand and continued LTH distribution, while ETF inflows have weakened, a sign of softening institutional appetite. Spot markets showed a controlled sell-off, and futures markets underwent a historic leverage flush, resetting systemic risk.
In the options market, open interest and volume rebounded swiftly, but volatility spiked, skew flipped sharply positive, and traders rushed to hedge. Despite rapid stabilization, the market remains in a reset phase, where renewed ETF inflows and sustained on-chain accumulation will be key to restoring confidence and confirming a durable recovery."

Bitcoin trades below the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis and the 0.85 quantile, signalling fading momentum and growing market fatigue. Repeated failures to reclaim these levels raise the risk of a longer consolidation phase.
Long-term holders have ramped up spending since July, now exceeding
22K BTC/day
, marking sustained profit-taking that continues to pressure market stability.
Open interest hit a new ATH, but sentiment leans bearish as traders favour puts over calls. Short-term rallies are being met with hedging rather than renewed optimism.
Implied volatility remains elevated, while realized volatility has caught up, ending the calm, low-volatility regime. Dealers‚Äô short gamma positioning amplifies selloffs and tempers rallies.
Both on-chain and options data suggest a cautious, transitional phase. Market recovery is likely to hinge on renewed spot demand and easing volatility.
Bitcoin has gradually drifted away from its recent all-time high, stabilizing below the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis of around
$113.1k
. Historically, this structure often precedes the onset of a mid-term bearish phase, as weaker hands begin to capitulate.
In this edition, we assess the market‚Äôs current profitability, examine the scale and persistence of long-term holder spending, and conclude by evaluating sentiment in the options market to gauge whether the correction reflects a healthy consolidation or signals deeper exhaustion ahead.
On-chain Insights
Testing Conviction
Trading around the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis marks a pivotal phase where the market tests the conviction of investors who bought near recent highs. Historically, a breakdown below this level following a new ATH has driven the Percent of Supply in Profit down to roughly 85%, implying that over 15% of supply sits at a loss.
We are now witnessing this pattern for the third time in the current cycle. If Bitcoin fails to recover above the ~113.1k, a deeper contraction could push a larger share of supply into loss, amplifying stress among recent buyers and potentially setting the stage for broader capitulation across the market.
Live Chart
Critical Thresholds
To further contextualize this structure, it‚Äôs essential to understand why reclaiming the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis is pivotal for sustaining a bullish phase. The Supply Quantile Cost Basis model provides a clear framework by mapping the 0.95, 0.85, and 0.75 quantiles, indicating levels where 5%, 15%, and 25% of the supply is held at a loss.
Currently, Bitcoin trades not only below the short-term holder cost basis ($113.1k) but is also struggling to stay above the 0.85 quantile at $108.6k.
Historically, failure to hold this threshold has signalled structural market weakness and often preceded deeper corrections toward the 0.75 quantile, which now aligns near $97.5k.
Live Chart
Exhausted Demand
Contracting below both the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis and the 0.85 quantile for the third time this cycle raises structural concerns. From a macro perspective, repeated demand exhaustion suggests the market may require a longer consolidation phase to rebuild strength.
This exhaustion becomes clearer when examining Long-Term Holder Spend Volume. Since the market peak in July 2025, long-term holders have steadily increased their spending, with the 30D-SMA rising from the 10K BTC (baseline) to over 22K BTC per day.
Such persistent distribution indicates profit-taking pressure from seasoned investors, which has been a key factor behind the market‚Äôs current fragility.
Live Chart
After evaluating the risk of a prolonged bearish phase from demand exhaustion, we now turn to the options market to gauge short-term sentiment and see how speculators are positioning amid rising uncertainty.
Off-chain Insights
Open Interest Rising
Bitcoin options open interest has reached a new all-time high and continues to expand, marking a structural evolution in market behaviour.
Rather than selling spot, investors are increasingly using options to hedge exposure or speculate on volatility. This shift reduces direct sell pressure in the spot market, but amplifies short-term volatility driven by dealer hedging activity.
As open interest grows, price swings are more likely to originate from delta- and gamma-driven flows in futures and perpetual markets. Understanding these dynamics is becoming crucial, as options positioning now plays a dominant role in shaping short-term market movements and amplifying reactions to macro and on-chain catalysts.
Live Chart
Volatility Regime Shift
Since the liquidation event on the 10th, the volatility landscape has clearly changed. Implied volatility (IV) now sits around 48 across maturities, compared with 36‚Äì43 just two weeks ago. The market hasn‚Äôt fully digested the shock, market makers remain cautious and are not selling volatility cheaply.
The 30-day realized volatility stands at 44.1%, while the 10-day realized is at 27.9%. As realized volatility gradually cools, we can expect IV to follow and normalize over the next few weeks.
For now, volatility remains elevated, but this looks more like a short-term repricing than the start of a sustained high-vol regime.
Live Chart
Put Skew Builds
Following the same theme, the skew toward puts has increased steadily over the past two weeks. The big liquidation spike pushed the put skew sharply higher, and although it briefly reset, the curve has since stabilized at structurally higher levels, meaning puts remain richer than calls.
Over the past week, the 1-week maturity has been choppy but stayed in the high-uncertainty zone, while all other maturities have moved 2‚Äì3 vol points further toward puts. This broadening across maturities (also referred to as tenors) indicates that caution is spreading along the curve.
This structure reflects a market willing to pay up for downside protection while maintaining limited upside exposure, balancing short-term fear within a still-confident long-term outlook.
Tuesday‚Äôs small rally (Oct 21) illustrated that sensitivity, as put premiums were cut in half within hours, showing how jumpy sentiment remains.
Live Chart
Risk Premium Turns
The 1-Month Volatility Risk Premium‚Äîthe gap between implied and realized volatility‚Äî
has turned negative
. For months, implied volatility stayed elevated while realized moves remained muted, rewarding short-vol traders with steady carry.
Now, realized volatility has surged to match implied, erasing that advantage. This marks the end of the calm regime: volatility sellers can no longer rely on passive income and are instead forced to hedge actively in choppier conditions.
The market has shifted from quiet complacency to a more dynamic, reactive environment where short-gamma positions face mounting pressure as real price swings return.
Live Chart
Flows Stay Defensive
To bring the analysis to the very short term, we zoom into the past 24 hours to
observe how option positioning
has reacted to the latest bounce.
Despite a 6% rally from $107.5K to $113.9K, there was little confirmation from call buying. Instead, traders added to their put exposure, effectively locking in higher price levels.
This positioning leaves dealers short gamma on the downside and long gamma on the upside, a setup that typically causes them to fade rallies and accelerate selloff, a dynamic that will continue to act as a headwind until positioning resets.
Premiums Tell the Story
Glassnode‚Äôs
aggregated premium data
confirms the same pattern when broken down by strike. At the $120K call, premiums sold have risen with the price; traders are fading the move higher and selling volatility into strength they see as short-lived.
Short-term yield seekers are taking advantage of spikes in implied volatility to sell calls into rallies rather than chase upside.
Live Chart
When looking at the 105K put premium, the pattern is reversed, confirming our thesis. As price climbed, net premiums on the 105K put increased. Traders were more eager to pay for downside protection than to buy upside convexity. That means the recent rally was met with hedging, not conviction.
Live Chart
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs recent correction below the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis ($113.1k) and the 0.85 quantile ($108.6k) highlights growing demand exhaustion, as the market struggles to attract new inflows while long-term holders continue to distribute. This structural fatigue suggests that the network may need a longer consolidation phase to rebuild confidence and absorb the spent supply.
Meanwhile, the options market reflects this same cautious tone. Despite record-high open interest, positioning leans defensive; put skew remains elevated, volatility sellers are under pressure, and short-term rallies are met with hedging rather than optimism. Together, these signals indicate a market in transition: one where exuberance has waned, structural risk-taking is subdued, and recovery will likely depend on restoring spot demand and mitigating volatility-driven flows."

Bitcoin‚Äôs weekend rebound from the $107K‚Äì$118K supply cluster mirrored previous post-ATH relief rallies, but sustained sell pressure from long-term holders has limited follow-through.
The market continues to struggle above the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis (~$113K), a critical battleground between bull and bear momentum. Failure to reclaim this level raises the risk of deeper retracement toward the Active Investors‚Äô Realized Price (~$88K).
Short-term holders are exiting at a loss, while long-term holders remain heavy net distributors (~‚Äì104K BTC/month), signaling waning conviction and ongoing supply absorption.
Implied volatility has cooled sharply after October‚Äôs crash, with skew flattening and options flows reflecting controlled upside and measured downside hedging.
The current calm in volatility hinges on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next decision. A dovish outcome would preserve stability, but any hawkish surprise could reignite volatility and downside protection demand
On-chain Insights
A Familiar Rebound Pattern
Over the weekend, Bitcoin staged a short-lived recovery after briefly dipping to the lower boundary of the top-buyers‚Äô supply cluster, spanning $107K‚Äì$118K. According to the Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap, the price rebounded from the midline near $116K before retracing to around $113K.
This structure closely mirrors the post-ATH bounce patterns observed in Q2‚ÄìQ3 2024 and Q1 2025, where temporary rallies emerged as demand was quickly absorbed by overhead supply.
In the current instance, renewed selling from long-term holders has further amplified resistance at this supply zone, highlighting how profit-taking at elevated levels continues to cap upward momentum.
Live Chart
Struggling to Hold the Line
Following the weekend rebound, Bitcoin briefly reclaimed the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis near $113.1K, a level often regarded as the dividing line between bullish and bearish momentum. Sustaining this threshold typically signals that demand is strong enough to absorb ongoing sell pressure. However, failure to remain above it, especially after spending six months consistently trading higher, suggests that demand is waning.
Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has struggled to close a weekly candle above this key level, raising the risk of further weakness ahead.
Should this phase persist, the next significant support lies around the Active Investors‚Äô Realized Price at $88K, a metric that reflects the cost basis of actively circulating supply and often marks deeper corrective phases in prior cycles.
Live Chart
Short-term Holder Pressure
Extending the analysis to investor sentiment, further market weakness would likely be driven by short-term holders‚Äîthe top buyers now exiting at a loss. The Short-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (STH-NUPL) metric helps gauge this stress by measuring unrealized profit or loss as a share of market cap.
Historically, deep negative values have coincided with capitulation phases that precede market bottom formation intervals. The recent drawdown to $107K pushed STH-NUPL to ‚Äì0.05, a mild loss compared to the ‚Äì0.1 to ‚Äì0.2 range typical of mid-bull corrections, or below ‚Äì0.2 during deep bear market lows.
As long as Bitcoin trades within the $107K‚Äì$117K top-buyer cluster, the market remains in a delicate balance, not yet in full capitulation, but with time working against the bulls as conviction continues to erode.
Live Chart
Long-Term Holders Distribution
Building on earlier observations, persistent selling by long-term holders (LTHs) continues to weigh on market structure. The Long-Term Holder Net Position Change has declined to ‚Äì104K BTC per month, highlighting the most significant wave of distribution since mid-July.
This ongoing sell pressure aligns with the broader signs of exhaustion seen across the market, as seasoned investors continue to realize profits into weakening demand.
Historically, major market expansions have begun only after long-term holders transition from net distribution to sustained accumulation. Therefore, a return to positive net inflows within this cohort remains a key prerequisite for restoring market resilience and setting the foundation for the next bullish phase.
Until such a shift occurs, distribution from long-term investors will likely keep price action under pressure.
Live Chart
To gauge the intensity of long-term holder selling, we can turn to the Transfer Volume from LTHs to Exchanges (30D-SMA), which captures the value of coins moved by seasoned investors for potential sale. This metric has surged to around $293M per day, more than double the $100M-$125M baseline that prevailed since November 2024.
Such elevated transfer activity indicates sustained profit realization by long-term investors, adding consistent sell-side pressure. The current pattern closely resembles August 2024, a period marked by long-term holders heated spending while price momentum is slowing down.
Unless this transfer flow subsides, it will remain difficult for spot demand to absorb the ongoing distribution, leaving the market vulnerable to further cooling in the weeks ahead.

Front End Calms Down
Transitioning to the options market, recent data shows that volatility stress following the 10 October crash continues to unwind. Bitcoin‚Äôs 30-day realized volatility has eased to 42.6%, down slightly from 44% last week, reflecting calmer price action. Meanwhile, implied volatility, which represents traders‚Äô expectations, has declined more sharply as participants unwind downside hedges and reduce demand for protection.
Shorter-dated maturities have seen the largest adjustment, with 1-week at-the-money implied volatility dropping over 10 vol points to around 40%, while 1-month to 6-month tenors slipped only 1‚Äì2 points, holding near the mid-40s. This flattening of the term structure suggests traders expect fewer near-term shocks.
The curve also implies a gentle grind higher in expected volatility toward ~45% over the next few months rather than shock-style spikes.
Live Chart
Skew Resets Lower
The easing in implied volatility has also translated into a notable shift in 25-delta skew, which measures the relative cost of puts versus calls. A positive skew indicates that puts are trading at a premium. Following the October washout, 1-week skew surged above 20%, signalling extreme demand for downside protection. Since then, it has collapsed toward neutral, rebounding slightly but with much lower intensity.
Longer-dated maturities, such as the 1-month and 3-month tenors, have also reset sharply, showing only a modest put premium. This shift indicates that traders have removed a significant portion of their downside hedges.
Positioning is now closer to ‚Äúmildly bullish/two-sided‚Äù rather than ‚Äúpanic about new lows,‚Äù aligning with the broader stabilization seen in Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price action.
Live Chart
Selective Upside Positioning
With skew normalizing, attention turns to where traders are allocating premium. Call activity now varies notably by strike. At the $115K strike, the net call premium bought remains positive, indicating that traders have consistently paid for near-term upside as the price has recovered over the past two weeks. In contrast, at the $120K strike, call premiums sold have outweighed buying, resulting in a negative net premium.
This setup reflects a ‚Äúmoderate rally, not full breakout‚Äù stance. Traders are willing to pay for gains closer to spot but are financing those positions by selling higher-strike calls.
The resulting call spread structure suggests a cautiously optimistic view, seeking participation in further upside, but with limited conviction in a full retest of the all-time highs.

Market Prices Controlled Pullbacks
To round out the picture, we can turn to the put side of the market. Since October 24, traders have been buying $110K puts as Bitcoin pushed higher, signalling demand for near-term downside protection. Meanwhile, $105K puts have been sold more actively, suggesting that participants are comfortable collecting premiums by providing insurance at deeper strikes.
This contrast highlights a market expecting shallow pullbacks rather than another major liquidation wave. Traders appear to view consolidation near current levels as plausible (hedging at 110K) but see a full breakdown below $105K as less likely.
The overall positioning supports the view that the worst of the October deleveraging is behind, with the market now focused on range trading and volatility harvesting instead of defensive hedging against another sharp selloff.

Conclusion:
The on-chain landscape continues to reflect a market in correction and recalibration. Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to hold above the short-term holders‚Äô cost basis highlights fading momentum and sustained sell pressure from both short-term and long-term investors. Elevated long-term holder distribution and high transfer volumes to exchanges underscore a phase of demand exhaustion, suggesting the market may need extended consolidation to rebuild confidence. Until long-term holders shift back to accumulation, upside recovery will likely remain constrained.
Transitioning to the options market, implied volatility has dropped sharply at the front end, skew has normalized, and option flows now reflect controlled upside exposure and measured downside hedging. Structurally, the crypto options market appears to be transitioning from crisis mode to rebuild mode, suggesting improved stability.
However, the next major catalyst looms, the Federal Reserve meeting. A rate cut is mostly priced in, meaning that a dovish outcome would likely keep volatility subdued and skew balanced. Conversely, if the Fed delivers a smaller cut or maintains a hawkish tone, short-dated implied volatility could reprice higher, and 25-delta skew may widen as traders rush back to buy protection. In essence, the market‚Äôs current calm is conditional, steady for now, but fragile if the Fed deviates from expectations."

Bitcoin fell below the Short-Term Holders‚Äô Cost Basis (~$112.5K), confirming fading demand and ending its prior bullish phase. Price now consolidates near $100K, about 21% below the ATH.
Around 71% of supply remains in profit, consistent with mid-cycle corrections. The Relative Unrealized Loss at 3.1% suggests a mild bear phase rather than deep capitulation.
Since July, LTH supply has declined by 300K BTC, marking ongoing distribution even as price trends lower, unlike earlier in the cycle when selling occurred into rallies.
U.S. Spot ETFs have recorded steady outflows (‚Äì$150M/day to ‚Äì$700M/day), while spot CVDs on major exchanges show persistent sell pressure and fading discretionary demand.
The Perpetual Market Directional Premium dropped from $338M/month in April to $118M/month, indicating traders are stepping back from leveraged longs.
Elevated put demand and higher premiums at the $100K strike show traders are still hedging, not buying the dip. Short-term implied volatility remains sensitive to price swings but is stabilizing after October‚Äôs spike.
Overall, market remains in a fragile equilibrium, with weak demand, controlled losses, and high caution. A sustained recovery requires renewed inflows and reclaiming the $112K‚Äì$113K region as support.
On-chain Insights
Following last week‚Äôs report,
Lacking Conviction
, Bitcoin broke below the $100K psychological threshold after repeatedly failing to reclaim the Short-Term Holders‚Äô cost basis. This breakdown confirms fading demand momentum and persistent sell pressure from long-term investors, marking a clear step away from the bullish phase.
In this edition, we use on-chain price models and spending indicators to assess the market‚Äôs structural weakness, then turn to spot, perpetual, and options market metrics to gauge sentiment and risk positioning for the week ahead.
Testing the Lower Bound
Since the market reset on October 10th, Bitcoin has struggled to hold above the Short-Term Holders‚Äô cost basis, resulting in a sharp decline to around $100K, approximately 11% below this key threshold at $112.5K.
Historically, discounts with such depth from this level have increased the likelihood of further downside toward lower structural supports, such as the Active Investors‚Äô Realized Price, currently near $88.5K
. This metric dynamically tracks the cost basis of actively circulating supply (excluding dormant coins) and has often served as a critical reference point during extended corrective phases in prior cycles.
Live Chart
At a Crossroad
Extending this analysis, the recent correction has formed a structure reminiscent of June 2024 and February 2025, periods where Bitcoin stood at a pivotal juncture between recovery and deeper contraction. At $100K, roughly 71% of the supply remains in profit‚Äîplacing the market near the lower bound of the typical 70%‚Äì90% equilibrium range seen during mid-cycle slowdowns.
This stage often features brief relief rallies toward the Short-Term Holders‚Äô cost basis, though a sustained recovery generally requires prolonged consolidation and renewed demand inflows.
Conversely, if further weakness pushes a larger share of supply into loss, the market risks transitioning from the current moderate downtrend into a deeper bearish phase, historically defined by capitulation and extended re-accumulation.
Live Chart
Losses Still Contained
To further distinguish the current drawdown, it‚Äôs useful to assess the Relative Unrealized Loss, which measures the total unrealized losses in USD relative to market capitalization. Unlike the 2022‚Äì2023 bear market, where losses reached extreme levels, the current reading of 3.1% suggests only moderate stress, comparable to mid-cycle corrections in Q3‚ÄìQ4 2024 and Q2 2025, all of which remained below the 5% threshold.
As long as unrealized losses stay within this range, the market can be classified as a mild bear phase characterized by orderly revaluation rather than panic.
However, a deeper drawdown pushing this ratio above 10% would likely trigger broader capitulation and mark the transition into a more severe bearish regime.
Live Chart
Persistent Long-Term Distribution
Despite the relatively contained loss intensity and a moderate 21% drawdown from the all-time high of $126K, the market remains under quiet yet persistent sell pressure from long-term holders (LTHs). This trend has been unfolding since July 2025, even as Bitcoin reached a new peak in early October, catching many by surprise.
During this period, LTH Supply has declined by ~300K BTC (from 14.7M to 14.4M BTC). Unlike previous distribution waves earlier in the cycle, when long-term holders sold into strength during major rallies, this time, they are selling into weakness.
In other words, they are offloading coins while the price ranges and continues to drift lower. This behavioural shift signals deeper fatigue and reduced conviction among seasoned investors.
Live Chart
Unpacking the Quiet Distribution
To better understand the ongoing long-term holder (LTH) distribution, it‚Äôs important to recognize that changes in LTH supply reflect two forces: coins spent and coins maturing beyond roughly 155 days. Since July 2025, the pace of spending has outstripped maturation, creating a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù form of distribution beneath the surface.
Comparing cumulative LTH spending with the net supply change reveals that long-term holders have spent around 2.4M BTC during this period, while new maturations offset much of this outflow, resulting in a net supply decline of 0.3M BTC.
Excluding the maturation effect, this spending represents roughly 12% of the circulating supply (2.4M / 19.4M). This is a substantial flow that helps explain the persistent sell-side pressure despite relatively stable price action.

Low on Ammo
Shifting focus to institutional demand, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a marked slowdown over the past two weeks, recording consistent net outflows between ‚Äì$150M and ‚Äì$700M per day. This contrasts sharply with the strong wave of inflows observed throughout September and early October, which had supported price resilience during that period.
The recent trend points to a moderation in institutional capital allocation, as profit-taking and reduced appetite for new exposure weigh on aggregate ETF buying pressure.
This cooling in activity aligns closely with the broader price weakness, highlighting a decline in buy-side conviction following several months of persistent accumulation.
Live Chart
Heavy Bias
Spot market activity has continued to weaken over the past month, with the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) Bias trending lower across major exchanges. Both Binance and aggregate spot CVDs have turned negative at ‚Äì822 BTC and ‚Äì917 BTC, respectively, signaling sustained net sell pressure and limited aggressive spot bidding. Coinbase remains comparatively neutral at +170 BTC, showing little evidence of meaningful buy-side absorption.
This deterioration in spot demand mirrors the broader slowdown in ETF inflows, suggesting a decline in discretionary investor conviction.
Together, these signals reinforce a cooling market tone, where buying interest remains subdued and rallies are met with increasingly swift profit-taking.
Live Chart
Spoiled Appetite
In the derivatives market, the Perpetual Market Directional Premium‚Äîthe interest paid by long traders to maintain positions‚Äîhas declined sharply from its April peak of $338M per month to around $118M per month. This notable reduction signals a broad unwind in speculative positioning and a clear cooling of risk appetite.
After an extended period of elevated positive funding through mid-year, the metric‚Äôs steady decline indicates that traders are scaling back directional leverage, favouring neutrality over aggressive long exposure.
This shift mirrors the broader softening seen in spot demand and ETF inflows, underscoring a transition in perpetual markets from an optimistic bias to a more cautious, risk-off stance.
Live Chart
Still Paying for Protection
As Bitcoin hovers around the $100K psychological level, options skew continue to signal strong demand for puts unsurprisingly.
The data show that the options market is not positioning for a reversal or ‚Äúbuying the dip,‚Äù but rather paying elevated premiums to guard against further downside.
Expensive puts at a key support level indicate that traders remain focused on protection rather than accumulation. In short, the market is still hedging, not bottom fishing (at least, not yet).
Live Chart
Risk Premium Turns Back Up
The one-month volatility risk premium has turned slightly positive after ten consecutive days in negative territory. As expected, the premium has mean-reverted, with implied volatility repricing higher following a difficult stretch for gamma sellers.
This shift reflects a market still dominated by caution, where traders are willing to pay elevated prices for protection, allowing market makers to step in on the other side.
It‚Äôs also notable how implied volatility responded as Bitcoin fell to the $100K level, rising in tandem with renewed defensive positioning.
Live Chart
Volatility Spikes Lower
Short-term implied volatility remains closely and inversely tied to price action. As Bitcoin sold off, volatility surged sharply, with one-week IV spiking to 54% before retracing about 10 vol points once support formed near $100K.
Longer expiries also moved higher, with the one-month tenor rising by roughly 4 vol points, and the six-month maturity gaining around 1.5 vol points compared to pre-correction levels near $110K.
This pattern underscores the classic panic-volatility relationship, where rapid price declines continue to drive short-term volatility spikes.
Live Chart
Defensive at 100K
Examining the $100K strike put premium offers further insight into current sentiment. Over the past two weeks, net put premiums have been gradually rising, then surged sharply yesterday as fears grew that the bull cycle might be ending. The premium spiked during the selloff and continues to trade elevated, even as Bitcoin stabilizes near its support level.
This trend confirms that hedging remains active, with traders still opting for protection over renewed risk-taking.
Live Chart
Flows Stay Defensive
Flow data from the past seven days show that taker activity has been dominated by negative delta positioning, mainly through puts bought and calls sold. The last 24 hours still show no clear signs of a bottom. Dealers remain long gamma, having absorbed significant risk from yield-seeking traders, and are likely to monetize price swings in both directions.
This setup keeps volatility elevated but controlled, maintaining a cautious tone.
Overall, the environment continues to favor defensiveness over aggressive risk-taking, with the absence of a clear upside catalyst.
However, as downside protection remains expensive, some traders may soon start fading that risk premium in search of value.
üí°
Options Traders‚Äô Psychology
Successful options trading is about monetizing positions built before the move. A profitable book requires reducing exposure into strength and taking profits on hedges when fear dominates the market. At present, traders aren‚Äôt buying the dip, but the current setup still offers asymmetric opportunities‚Äîallowing disciplined participants to position early for the next leg once volatility and sentiment begin to reset.
Conclusion
Bitcoin‚Äôs break below the Short-Term Holders‚Äô Cost Basis (~$112.5K) and subsequent stabilization around $100K mark a decisive shift in market structure. So far, this correction mirrors prior mid-cycle slowdowns, with 71% (70%-90%) of supply still in profit and Relative Unrealized Loss contained at 3.1% (<5%), suggesting a mild bear phase rather than a deep capitulation. However, sustained long-term holder distribution since July and continued outflows from ETF products underscore weakening conviction across both retail and institutional fronts.
The Active Investors‚Äô Realized Price (~$88.5K) remains a critical downside reference if selling persists, while reclaiming the Short-Term Holders‚Äô Cost Basis would signal renewed demand strength. Meanwhile, the Perpetual Market Directional Premium and CVD bias both point to a retreat from speculative leverage and thinning spot participation, reinforcing a risk-off environment.
In the options market, elevated put demand, rising premiums at the $100K strike, and a modest rebound in implied volatility confirm a defensive tone. Traders continue to prioritize protection over accumulation, reflecting hesitation to call a bottom.
Overall, the market remains in a fragile equilibrium; oversold but not panicked, cautious yet structurally intact. The next directional impulse will likely hinge on whether renewed demand can absorb ongoing long-term holder distribution and reclaim the $112K‚Äì$113K region as firm support, or whether sellers maintain control and extend the current downtrend."
